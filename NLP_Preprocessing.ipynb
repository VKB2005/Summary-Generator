He so obviously\\ndisregards all the canons and unities and other things which every\\nwell-bred dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthy\\nof serious criticism (orthodox). Indeed he knows no more about the\\ndramatic art than, according to his own story in \\\"The Man of Destiny,\\\"\\nNapoleon at Tavazzano knew of the Art of War. But both men were\\nsuccesses each in his way--the latter won victories and the former\\ngained audiences, in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war and\\nthe theatre. Shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have his\\ncharacters make long speeches at one another, apparently thinking that\\nthis embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of\\nbombast and rhetoric. There never was an author who showed less\\npredilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results.\\nHe recognized, early in his days, many things awry in the world and he\\nassumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit. It\\nseems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright. He began as an\\nEssayist, but who reads essays now-a-days?--he then turned novelist with\\nno better success, for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he\\nchose to emit. He only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men\\nand women--although he has created few of the latter--can be most\\nextremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking.\\n\\nAs a last resort, he turned to the stage, not that he cared for the\\ndramatic art, for no man seems to care less about \\\"Art for Art's sake,\\\"\\nbeing in this a perfect foil to his brilliant compatriot and\\ncontemporary, Wilde. He cast his theories in dramatic forms merely\\nbecause no other course except silence or physical revolt was open to\\nhim. For a long time it seemed as if this resource too was doomed to\\nfail him. But finally he has attained a hearing and now attempts at\\nsuppression merely serve to advertise their victim.\\n\\nIt will repay those who seek analogies in literature to compare Shaw\\nwith Cervantes. After a life of heroic endeavor, disappointment,\\nslavery, and poverty, the author of \\\"Don Quixote\\\" gave the world a\\nserious work which caused to be laughed off the world's stage forever\\nthe final vestiges of decadent chivalry.\\n\\nThe institution had long been outgrown, but its vernacular continued to\\nbe the speech and to express the thought \\\"of the world and among the\\nvulgar,\\\" as the quaint, old novelist puts it, just as to-day the novel\\nintended for the consumption of the unenlightened must deal with peers\\nand millionaires and be dressed in stilted language. Marvellously he\\nsucceeded, but in a way he least intended. We have not yet, after so\\nmany years, determined whether it is a work to laugh or cry over. \\\"It is\\nour joyfullest modern book,\\\" says Carlyle, while Landor thinks that\\n\\\"readers who see nothing more than a burlesque in 'Don Quixote' have but\\nshallow appreciation of the work.\\\"\\n\\nShaw in like manner comes upon the scene when many of our social usages\\nare outworn. He sees the fact, announces it, and we burst into guffaws.\\nThe continuous laughter which greets Shaw's plays arises from a real\\ncontrast in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences. When\\nPinero or Jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a\\nmoment that the author's point of view is our own and that the abnormal\\npredicament of his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his\\naudience. With Shaw this sense of community of feeling is wholly\\nlacking. He describes things as he sees them, and the house is in a\\nroar. Who is right? If we were really using our own senses and not\\ngazing through the glasses of convention and romance and make-believe,\\nshould we see things as Shaw does?\\n\\nMust it not cause Shaw to doubt his own or the public's sanity to hear\\naudiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations? And yet, if they\\ndid not come to laugh, they would not come at all. Mockery is the price\\nhe must pay for a hearing. Or has he calculated to a nicety the power of\\nreaction? Does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of\\nsordidness, to disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness, to\\nillusion by disillusionment? It is impossible to believe that he is\\nunconscious of the humor of his dramatic situations, yet he stoically\\ngives no sign. He even dares the charge, terrible in proportion to its\\ntruth, which the most serious of us shrinks from--the lack of a sense of\\nhumor. Men would rather have their integrity impugned.\\n\\nIn \\\"Arms and the Man\\\" the subject which occupies the dramatist's\\nattention is that survival of barbarity--militarism--which raises its\\nhorrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our\\ncivilization. No more hoary superstition survives than that the donning\\nof a uniform changes the nature of the wearer. This notion pervades\\nsociety to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon\\nthe stage acting rationally, our conventionalized senses are shocked.\\nThe only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently\\nbeen there, and, of course, Mr. Shaw, who has no illusions about\\nanything.\\n\\nIt is hard to speak too highly of \\\"Candida.\\\" No equally subtle and\\nincisive study of domestic relations exists in the English drama. One\\nhas to turn to George Meredith's \\\"The Egoist\\\" to find such character\\ndissection. The central note of the play is, that with the true woman,\\nweakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than\\nstrength which offers protection. Candida is quite unpoetic, as, indeed,\\nwith rare exceptions, women are prone to be. They have small delight in\\npoetry, but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made. The\\nhusband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness, the poet\\npitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth,\\nthe hopelessly de-moralized manufacturer, the conventional and hence\\nemotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be\\nchallenged to rival.\\n\\nIn \\\"The Man of Destiny\\\" the object of the dramatist is not so much the\\ndestruction as the explanation of the Napoleonic tradition, which has so\\npowerfully influenced generation after generation for a century. However\\nthe man may be regarded, he was a miracle. Shaw shows that he achieved\\nhis extraordinary career by suspending, for himself, the pressure of the\\nmoral and conventional atmosphere, while leaving it operative for\\nothers. Those who study this play--extravaganza, that it is--will attain\\na clearer comprehension of Napoleon than they can get from all the\\nbiographies.\\n\\n\\\"You Never Can Tell\\\" offers an amusing study of the play of social\\nconventions. The \\\"twins\\\" illustrate the disconcerting effects of that\\nperfect frankness which would make life intolerable. Gloria demonstrates\\nthe powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts. The idea that\\nparental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such\\nknowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned.\\nCrampton, the father, typifies the common superstition that among the\\nprivileges of parenthood are inflexibility, tyranny, and respect, the\\nlast entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved.\\n\\nThe waiter, William, is the best illustration of the man \\\"who knows his\\nplace\\\" that the stage has seen. He is the most pathetic figure of the\\nplay. One touch of verisimilitude is lacking; none of the guests gives\\nhim a tip, yet he maintains his urbanity. As Mr. Shaw has not yet\\nvisited America he may be unaware of the improbability of this\\nsituation.\\n\\nTo those who regard literary men merely as purveyors of amusement for\\npeople who have not wit enough to entertain themselves, Ibsen and Shaw,\\nMaeterlinck and Gorky must remain enigmas. It is so much pleasanter to\\nignore than to face unpleasant realities--to take Riverside Drive and\\nnot Mulberry Street as the exponent of our life and the expression of\\nour civilization. These men are the sappers and miners of the advancing\\narmy of justice. The audience which demands the truth and despises the\\ncontemptible conventions that dominate alike our stage and our life is\\ndaily growing. Shaw and men like him--if indeed he is not absolutely\\nunique--will not for the future lack a hearing.\\n\\nM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARMS AND THE MAN. ACT I\\n\\n\\n\\n    Night. A lady's bedchamber in Bulgaria, in a small\\n    town near the Dragoman Pass. It is late in\\n    November in the year 1885, and through an open\\n    window with a little balcony on the left can be\\n    seen a peak of the Balkans, wonderfully white and\\n    beautiful in the starlit snow. The interior of the\\n    room is not like anything to be seen in the east\\n    of Europe. It is half rich Bulgarian, half cheap\\n    Viennese. The counterpane and hangings of the bed,\\n    the window curtains, the little carpet, and all\\n    the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are\\n    oriental and gorgeous: the paper on the walls is\\n    occidental and paltry. Above the head of the bed,\\n    which stands against a little wall cutting off the\\n    right hand corner of the room diagonally, is a\\n    painted wooden shrine, blue and gold, with an\\n    ivory image of Christ, and a light hanging before\\n    it in a pierced metal ball suspended by three\\n    chains. On the left, further forward, is an\\n    ottoman. The washstand, against the wall on the\\n    left, consists of an enamelled iron basin with a\\n    pail beneath it in a painted metal frame, and a\\n    single towel on the rail at the side. A chair near\\n    it is Austrian bent wood, with cane seat. The\\n    dressing table, between the bed and the window, is\\n    an ordinary pine table, covered with a cloth of\\n    many colors, but with an expensive toilet mirror\\n    on it. The door is on the right; and there is a\\n    chest of drawers between the door and the bed.\\n    This chest of drawers is also covered by a\\n    variegated native cloth, and on it there is a pile\\n    of paper backed novels, a box of chocolate creams,\\n    and a miniature easel, on which is a large\\n    photograph of an extremely handsome officer, whose\\n    lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even\\n    from the portrait. The room is lighted by a candle\\n    on the chest of drawers, and another on the\\n    dressing table, with a box of matches beside it.\\n\\n    The window is hinged doorwise and stands wide\\n    open, folding back to the left. Outside a pair of\\n    wooden shutters, opening outwards, also stand\\n    open. On the balcony, a young lady, intensely\\n    conscious of the romantic beauty of the night, and\\n    of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part\\n    of it, is on the balcony, gazing at the snowy\\n    Balkans. She is covered by a long mantle of furs,\\n    worth, on a moderate estimate, about three times\\n    the furniture of her room.\\n\\n    Her reverie is interrupted by her mother,\\n    Catherine Petkoff, a woman over forty, imperiously\\n    energetic, with magnificent black hair and eyes,\\n    who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife\\n    of a mountain farmer, but is determined to be a\\n    Viennese lady, and to that end wears a fashionable\\n    tea gown on all occasions.\\n\\nCATHERINE (entering hastily, full of good news). Raina--(she\\npronounces it Rah-eena, with the stress on the ee) Raina--(she\\ngoes to the bed, expecting to find Raina there.) Why,\\nwhere--(Raina looks into the room.) Heavens! child, are you out\\nin the night air instead of in your bed? You'll catch your\\ndeath. Louka told me you were asleep.\\n\\nRAINA (coming in). I sent her away. I wanted to be alone. The\\nstars are so beautiful! What is the matter?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Such news. There has been a battle!\\n\\nRAINA (her eyes dilating). Ah! (She throws the cloak on the\\nottoman, and comes eagerly to Catherine in her nightgown, a\\npretty garment, but evidently the only one she has on.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory! And it was\\nwon by Sergius.\\n\\nRAINA (with a cry of delight). Ah! (Rapturously.) Oh, mother!\\n(Then, with sudden anxiety) Is father safe?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Of course: he sent me the news. Sergius is the hero\\nof the hour, the idol of the regiment.\\n\\nRAINA. Tell me, tell me. How was it! (Ecstatically) Oh, mother,\\nmother, mother! (Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and\\nthey kiss one another frantically.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (with surging enthusiasm). You can't guess how\\nsplendid it is. A cavalry charge--think of that! He defied our\\nRussian commanders--acted without orders--led a charge on his\\nown responsibility--headed it himself--was the first man to\\nsweep through their guns. Can't you see it, Raina; our gallant\\nsplendid Bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing,\\nthundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched\\nServian dandies like chaff. And you--you kept Sergius waiting a\\nyear before you would be betrothed to him. Oh, if you have a\\ndrop of Bulgarian blood in your veins, you will worship him when\\nhe comes back.\\n\\nRAINA. What will he care for my poor little worship after the\\nacclamations of a whole army of heroes? But no matter: I am so\\nhappy--so proud! (She rises and walks about excitedly.) It\\nproves that all our ideas were real after all.\\n\\nCATHERINE (indignantly). Our ideas real! What do you mean?\\n\\nRAINA. Our ideas of what Sergius would do--our patriotism--our\\nheroic ideals. Oh, what faithless little creatures girls are!--I\\nsometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams.\\nWhen I buckled on Sergius's sword he looked so noble: it was\\ntreason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure. And\\nyet--and yet--(Quickly.) Promise me you'll never tell him.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Don't ask me for promises until I know what I am\\npromising.\\n\\nRAINA. Well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in\\nhis arms and looking into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our\\nheroic ideas because we are so fond of reading Byron and\\nPushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera that\\nseason at Bucharest. Real life is so seldom like that--indeed\\nnever, as far as I knew it then. (Remorsefully.) Only think,\\nmother, I doubted him: I wondered whether all his heroic\\nqualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination\\nwhen he went into a real battle. I had an uneasy fear that he\\nmight cut a poor figure there beside all those clever Russian\\nofficers.\\n\\nCATHERINE. A poor figure! Shame on you! The Servians have\\nAustrian officers who are just as clever as our Russians; but we\\nhave beaten them in every battle for all that.\\n\\nRAINA (laughing and sitting down again). Yes, I was only a\\nprosaic little coward. Oh, to think that it was all true--that\\nSergius is just as splendid and noble as he looks--that the\\nworld is really a glorious world for women who can see its glory\\nand men who can act its romance! What happiness! what\\nunspeakable fulfilment! Ah! (She throws herself on her knees\\nbeside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her.\\nThey are interrupted by the entry of Louka, a handsome, proud\\ngirl in a pretty Bulgarian peasant's dress with double apron, so\\ndefiant that her servility to Raina is almost insolent. She is\\nafraid of Catherine, but even with her goes as far as she dares.\\nShe is just now excited like the others; but she has no sympathy\\nfor Raina's raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies\\nof the two before she addresses them.)\\n\\nLOUKA. If you please, madam, all the windows are to be closed\\nand the shutters made fast. They say there may be shooting in\\nthe streets. (Raina and Catherine rise together, alarmed.) The\\nServians are being chased right back through the pass; and they\\nsay they may run into the town. Our cavalry will be after them;\\nand our people will be ready for them you may be sure, now that\\nthey are running away. (She goes out on the balcony and pulls\\nthe outside shutters to; then steps back into the room.)\\n\\nRAINA. I wish our people were not so cruel. What glory is there\\nin killing wretched fugitives?\\n\\nCATHERINE (business-like, her housekeeping instincts aroused).\\nI must see that everything is made safe downstairs.\\n\\nRAINA (to Louka). Leave the shutters so that I can just close\\nthem if I hear any noise.\\n\\nCATHERINE (authoritatively, turning on her way to the door).\\nOh, no, dear, you must keep them fastened. You would be sure to\\ndrop off to sleep and leave them open. Make them fast, Louka.\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes, madam. (She fastens them.)\\n\\nRAINA. Don't be anxious about me. The moment I hear a shot, I\\nshall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my\\nears well covered.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Quite the wisest thing you can do, my love.\\nGood-night.\\n\\nRAINA. Good-night. (They kiss one another, and Raina's emotion\\ncomes back for a moment.) Wish me joy of the happiest night of\\nmy life--if only there are no fugitives.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Go to bed, dear; and don't think of them. (She goes\\nout.)\\n\\nLOUKA (secretly, to Raina). If you would like the shutters\\nopen, just give them a push like this. (She pushes them: they\\nopen: she pulls them to again.) One of them ought to be bolted\\nat the bottom; but the bolt's gone.\\n\\nRAINA (with dignity, reproving her). Thanks, Louka; but we must\\ndo what we are told. (Louka makes a grimace.) Good-night.\\n\\nLOUKA (carelessly). Good-night. (She goes out, swaggering.)\\n\\n   (Raina, left alone, goes to the chest of drawers,\\n    and adores the portrait there with feelings that\\n    are beyond all expression. She does not kiss it or\\n    press it to her breast, or shew it any mark of\\n    bodily affection; but she takes it in her hands\\n    and elevates it like a priestess.)\\n\\nRAINA (looking up at the picture with worship.) Oh, I shall\\nnever be unworthy of you any more, my hero--never, never, never.\\n\\n    (She replaces it reverently, and selects a novel\\n    from the little pile of books. She turns over the\\n    leaves dreamily; finds her page; turns the book\\n    inside out at it; and then, with a happy sigh,\\n    gets into bed and prepares to read herself to\\n    sleep. But before abandoning herself to fiction,\\n    she raises her eyes once more, thinking of the\\n    blessed reality and murmurs)\\n\\nMy hero! my hero!\\n\\n    (A distant shot breaks the quiet of the night\\n    outside. She starts, listening; and two more\\n    shots, much nearer, follow, startling her so that\\n    she scrambles out of bed, and hastily blows out\\n    the candle on the chest of drawers. Then, putting\\n    her fingers in her ears, she runs to the\\n    dressing-table and blows out the light there, and\\n    hurries back to bed. The room is now in darkness:\\n    nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in\\n    the pierced ball before the image, and the\\n    starlight seen through the slits at the top of the\\n    shutters. The firing breaks out again: there is a\\n    startling fusillade quite close at hand. Whilst it\\n    is still echoing, the shutters disappear, pulled\\n    open from without, and for an instant the\\n    rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the\\n    figure of a man in black upon it. The shutters\\n    close immediately and the room is dark again. But\\n    the silence is now broken by the sound of panting.\\n    Then there is a scrape; and the flame of a match\\n    is seen in the middle of the room.)\\n\\nRAINA (crouching on the bed). Who's there? (The match is out\\ninstantly.) Who's there? Who is that?\\n\\nA MAN'S VOICE (in the darkness, subduedly, but threateningly).\\nSh--sh! Don't call out or you'll be shot. Be good; and no harm\\nwill happen to you. (She is heard leaving her bed, and making\\nfor the door.) Take care, there's no use in trying to run away.\\nRemember, if you raise your voice my pistol will go off.\\n(Commandingly.) Strike a light and let me see you. Do you hear?\\n(Another moment of silence and darkness. Then she is heard\\nretreating to the dressing-table. She lights a candle, and the\\nmystery is at an end. A man of about 35, in a deplorable plight,\\nbespattered with mud and blood and snow, his belt and the strap\\nof his revolver case keeping together the torn ruins of the blue\\ncoat of a Servian artillery officer. As far as the candlelight\\nand his unwashed, unkempt condition make it possible to judge,\\nhe is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance,\\nwith strong neck and shoulders, a roundish, obstinate looking\\nhead covered with short crisp bronze curls, clear quick blue\\neyes and good brows and mouth, a hopelessly prosaic nose like\\nthat of a strong-minded baby, trim soldierlike carriage and\\nenergetic manner, and with all his wits about him in spite of\\nhis desperate predicament--even with a sense of humor of it,\\nwithout, however, the least intention of trifling with it or\\nthrowing away a chance. He reckons up what he can guess about\\nRaina--her age, her social position, her character, the extent\\nto which she is frightened--at a glance, and continues, more\\npolitely but still most determinedly) Excuse my disturbing you;\\nbut you recognise my uniform--Servian. If I'm caught I shall be\\nkilled. (Determinedly.) Do you understand that?\\n\\nRAINA. Yes.\\n\\nMAN. Well, I don't intend to get killed if I can help it. (Still\\nmore determinedly.) Do you understand that? (He locks the door\\nwith a snap.)\\n\\nRAINA (disdainfully). I suppose not. (She draws herself up\\nsuperbly, and looks him straight in the face, saying with\\nemphasis) Some soldiers, I know, are afraid of death.\\n\\nMAN (with grim goodhumor). All of them, dear lady, all of them,\\nbelieve me. It is our duty to live as long as we can, and kill\\nas many of the enemy as we can. Now if you raise an alarm--\\n\\nRAINA (cutting him short). You will shoot me. How do you know\\nthat I am afraid to die?\\n\\nMAN (cunningly). Ah; but suppose I don't shoot you, what will\\nhappen then? Why, a lot of your cavalry--the greatest\\nblackguards in your army--will burst into this pretty room of\\nyours and slaughter me here like a pig; for I'll fight like a\\ndemon: they shan't get me into the street to amuse themselves\\nwith: I know what they are. Are you prepared to receive that\\nsort of company in your present undress? (Raina, suddenly\\nconscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it\\nmore closely about her. He watches her, and adds, pitilessly)\\nIt's rather scanty, eh? (She turns to the ottoman. He raises his\\npistol instantly, and cries) Stop! (She stops.) Where are you\\ngoing?\\n\\nRAINA (with dignified patience). Only to get my cloak.\\n\\nMAN (darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak). A good\\nidea. No: I'll keep the cloak: and you will take care that\\nnobody comes in and sees you without it. This is a better weapon\\nthan the pistol. (He throws the pistol down on the ottoman.)\\n\\nRAINA (revolted). It is not the weapon of a gentleman!\\n\\nMAN. It's good enough for a man with only you to stand between\\nhim and death. (As they look at one another for a moment, Raina\\nhardly able to believe that even a Servian officer can be so\\ncynically and selfishly unchivalrous, they are startled by a\\nsharp fusillade in the street. The chill of imminent death\\nhushes the man's voice as he adds) Do you hear? If you are going\\nto bring those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you\\nare. (Raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn. Suddenly he\\nstarts, listening. There is a step outside. Someone tries the\\ndoor, and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it. Raina looks\\nat the man, breathless. He throws up his head with the gesture\\nof a man who sees that it is all over with him, and, dropping\\nthe manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her, flings\\nthe cloak to her, exclaiming, sincerely and kindly) No use: I'm\\ndone for. Quick! wrap yourself up: they're coming!\\n\\nRAINA (catching the cloak eagerly). Oh, thank you. (She wraps\\nherself up with great relief. He draws his sabre and turns to\\nthe door, waiting.)\\n\\nLOUKA (outside, knocking). My lady, my lady! Get up, quick, and\\nopen the door.\\n\\nRAINA (anxiously). What will you do?\\n\\nMAN (grimly). Never mind. Keep out of the way. It will not last\\nlong.\\n\\nRAINA (impulsively). I'll help you. Hide yourself, oh, hide\\nyourself, quick, behind the curtain. (She seizes him by a torn\\nstrip of his sleeve, and pulls him towards the window.)\\n\\nMAN (yielding to her). There is just half a chance, if you keep\\nyour head. Remember: nine soldiers out of ten are born fools.\\n(He hides behind the curtain, looking out for a moment to say,\\nfinally) If they find me, I promise you a fight--a devil of a\\nfight! (He disappears. Raina takes off the cloak and throws it\\nacross the foot of the bed. Then with a sleepy, disturbed air,\\nshe opens the door. Louka enters excitedly.)\\n\\nLOUKA. A man has been seen climbing up the water-pipe to your\\nbalcony--a Servian. The soldiers want to search for him; and\\nthey are so wild and drunk and furious. My lady says you are to\\ndress at once.\\n\\nRAINA (as if annoyed at being disturbed). They shall not search\\nhere. Why have they been let in?\\n\\nCATHERINE (coming in hastily). Raina, darling, are you safe?\\nHave you seen anyone or heard anything?\\n\\nRAINA. I heard the shooting. Surely the soldiers will not dare\\ncome in here?\\n\\nCATHERINE. I have found a Russian officer, thank Heaven: he\\nknows Sergius. (Speaking through the door to someone outside.)\\nSir, will you come in now! My daughter is ready.\\n\\n    (A young Russian officer, in Bulgarian uniform,\\n     enters, sword in hand.)\\n\\nTHE OFFICER. (with soft, feline politeness and stiff military\\ncarriage). Good evening, gracious lady; I am sorry to intrude,\\nbut there is a fugitive hiding on the balcony. Will you and the\\ngracious lady your mother please to withdraw whilst we search?\\n\\nRAINA (petulantly). Nonsense, sir, you can see that there is no\\none on the balcony. (She throws the shutters wide open and\\nstands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden,\\npointing to the moonlit balcony. A couple of shots are fired\\nright under the window, and a bullet shatters the glass opposite\\nRaina, who winks and gasps, but stands her ground, whilst\\nCatherine screams, and the officer rushes to the balcony.)\\n\\nTHE OFFICER. (on the balcony, shouting savagely down to the\\nstreet). Cease firing there, you fools: do you hear? Cease\\nfiring, damn you. (He glares down for a moment; then turns to\\nRaina, trying to resume his polite manner.) Could anyone have\\ngot in without your knowledge? Were you asleep?\\n\\nRAINA. No, I have not been to bed.\\n\\nTHE OFFICER. (impatiently, coming back into the room). Your\\nneighbours have their heads so full of runaway Servians that\\nthey see them everywhere. (Politely.) Gracious lady, a thousand\\npardons. Good-night. (Military bow, which Raina returns coldly.\\nAnother to Catherine, who follows him out. Raina closes the\\nshutters. She turns and sees Louka, who has been watching the\\nscene curiously.)\\n\\nRAINA. Don't leave my mother, Louka, whilst the soldiers are\\nhere. (Louka glances at Raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain;\\nthen purses her lips secretively, laughs to herself, and goes\\nout. Raina follows her to the door, shuts it behind her with a\\nslam, and locks it violently. The man immediately steps out from\\nbehind the curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the\\ndanger from his mind in a businesslike way.)\\n\\nMAN. A narrow shave; but a miss is as good as a mile. Dear young\\nlady, your servant until death. I wish for your sake I had\\njoined the Bulgarian army instead of the Servian. I am not a\\nnative Servian.\\n\\nRAINA (haughtily). No, you are one of the Austrians who set the\\nServians on to rob us of our national liberty, and who officer\\ntheir army for them. We hate them!\\n\\nMAN. Austrian! not I. Don't hate me, dear young lady. I am only\\na Swiss, fighting merely as a professional soldier. I joined\\nServia because it was nearest to me. Be generous: you've beaten\\nus hollow.\\n\\nRAINA. Have I not been generous?\\n\\nMAN. Noble!--heroic! But I'm not saved yet. This particular rush\\nwill soon pass through; but the pursuit will go on all night by\\nfits and starts. I must take my chance to get off during a quiet\\ninterval. You don't mind my waiting just a minute or two, do\\nyou?\\n\\nRAINA. Oh, no: I am sorry you will have to go into danger again.\\n(Motioning towards ottoman.) Won't you sit--(She breaks off\\nwith an irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the\\npistol. The man, all nerves, shies like a frightened horse.)\\n\\nMAN (irritably). Don't frighten me like that. What is it?\\n\\nRAINA. Your pistol! It was staring that officer in the face all\\nthe time. What an escape!\\n\\nMAN (vexed at being unnecessarily terrified). Oh, is that all?\\n\\nRAINA (staring at him rather superciliously, conceiving a\\npoorer and poorer opinion of him, and feeling proportionately\\nmore and more at her ease with him). I am sorry I frightened\\nyou. (She takes up the pistol and hands it to him.) Pray take it\\nto protect yourself against me.\\n\\nMAN (grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol).\\nNo use, dear young lady: there's nothing in it. It's not loaded.\\n(He makes a grimace at it, and drops it disparagingly into his\\nrevolver case.)\\n\\nRAINA. Load it by all means.\\n\\nMAN. I've no ammunition. What use are cartridges in battle? I\\nalways carry chocolate instead; and I finished the last cake of\\nthat yesterday.\\n\\nRAINA (outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood).\\nChocolate! Do you stuff your pockets with sweets--like a\\nschoolboy--even in the field?\\n\\nMAN. Yes. Isn't it contemptible?\\n\\n   (Raina stares at him, unable to utter her\\n    feelings. Then she sails away scornfully to the\\n    chest of drawers, and returns with the box of\\n    confectionery in her hand.)\\n\\nRAINA. Allow me. I am sorry I have eaten them all except these.\\n(She offers him the box.)\\n\\nMAN (ravenously). You're an angel! (He gobbles the comfits.)\\nCreams! Delicious! (He looks anxiously to see whether there are\\nany more. There are none. He accepts the inevitable with\\npathetic goodhumor, and says, with grateful emotion) Bless you,\\ndear lady. You can always tell an old soldier by the inside of\\nhis holsters and cartridge boxes. The young ones carry pistols\\nand cartridges; the old ones, grub. Thank you. (He hands back\\nthe box. She snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it\\naway. This impatient action is so sudden that he shies again.)\\nUgh! Don't do things so suddenly, gracious lady. Don't revenge\\nyourself because I frightened you just now.\\n\\nRAINA (superbly). Frighten me! Do you know, sir, that though I\\nam only a woman, I think I am at heart as brave as you.\\n\\nMAN. I should think so. You haven't been under fire for three\\ndays as I have. I can stand two days without shewing it much;\\nbut no man can stand three days: I'm as nervous as a mouse. (He\\nsits down on the ottoman, and takes his head in his hands.)\\nWould you like to see me cry?\\n\\nRAINA (quickly). No.\\n\\nMAN. If you would, all you have to do is to scold me just as if\\nI were a little boy and you my nurse. If I were in camp now\\nthey'd play all sorts of tricks on me.\\n\\nRAINA (a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you. (Touched\\nby the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks\\ngratefully at her: she immediately draws back and says stiffly)\\nYou must excuse me: our soldiers are not like that. (She moves\\naway from the ottoman.)\\n\\nMAN. Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers:\\nold ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of\\nyour fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that\\nyou've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war,\\nnothing else. (Indignantly.) I never saw anything so\\nunprofessional.\\n\\nRAINA (ironically). Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you?\\n\\nMAN. Well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of\\ncavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty\\nthat if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within\\nfifty yards of the fire? I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw\\nit.\\n\\nRAINA (eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her\\ndream of glory rush back on her). Did you see the great cavalry\\ncharge? Oh, tell me about it. Describe it to me.\\n\\nMAN. You never saw a cavalry charge, did you?\\n\\nRAINA. How could I?\\n\\nMAN. Ah, perhaps not--of course. Well, it's a funny sight. It's\\nlike slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one\\ncomes; then two or three close behind him; and then all the rest\\nin a lump.\\n\\nRAINA (her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands\\necstatically). Yes, first One!--the bravest of the brave!\\n\\nMAN (prosaically). Hm! you should see the poor devil pulling at\\nhis horse.\\n\\nRAINA. Why should he pull at his horse?\\n\\nMAN (impatient of so stupid a question). It's running away with\\nhim, of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there\\nbefore the others and be killed? Then they all come. You can\\ntell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing. The\\nold ones come bunched up under the number one guard: they know\\nthat they are mere projectiles, and that it's no use trying to\\nfight. The wounds are mostly broken knees, from the horses\\ncannoning together.\\n\\nRAINA. Ugh! But I don't believe the first man is a coward. I\\nbelieve he is a hero!\\n\\nMAN (goodhumoredly). That's what you'd have said if you'd seen\\nthe first man in the charge to-day.\\n\\nRAINA (breathless). Ah, I knew it! Tell me--tell me about him.\\n\\nMAN. He did it like an operatic tenor--a regular handsome\\nfellow, with flashing eyes and lovely moustache, shouting a\\nwar-cry and charging like Don Quixote at the windmills. We\\nnearly burst with laughter at him; but when the sergeant ran up\\nas white as a sheet, and told us they'd sent us the wrong\\ncartridges, and that we couldn't fire a shot for the next ten\\nminutes, we laughed at the other side of our mouths. I never\\nfelt so sick in my life, though I've been in one or two very\\ntight places. And I hadn't even a revolver cartridge--nothing\\nbut chocolate. We'd no bayonets--nothing. Of course, they just\\ncut us to bits. And there was Don Quixote flourishing like a\\ndrum major, thinking he'd done the cleverest thing ever known,\\nwhereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it. Of all the fools\\never let loose on a field of battle, that man must be the very\\nmaddest. He and his regiment simply committed suicide--only the\\npistol missed fire, that's all.\\n\\nRAINA (deeply wounded, but steadfastly loyal to her ideals).\\nIndeed! Would you know him again if you saw him?\\n\\nMAN. Shall I ever forget him. (She again goes to the chest of\\ndrawers. He watches her with a vague hope that she may have\\nsomething else for him to eat. She takes the portrait from its\\nstand and brings it to him.)\\n\\nRAINA. That is a photograph of the gentleman--the patriot and\\nhero--to whom I am betrothed.\\n\\nMAN (looking at it). I'm really very sorry. (Looking at her.)\\nWas it fair to lead me on? (He looks at the portrait again.)\\nYes: that's him: not a doubt of it. (He stifles a laugh.)\\n\\nRAINA (quickly). Why do you laugh?\\n\\nMAN (shamefacedly, but still greatly tickled). I didn't laugh,\\nI assure you. At least I didn't mean to. But when I think of him\\ncharging the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest\\nthing--(chokes with suppressed laughter).\\n\\nRAINA (sternly). Give me back the portrait, sir.\\n\\nMAN (with sincere remorse). Of course. Certainly. I'm really\\nvery sorry. (She deliberately kisses it, and looks him straight\\nin the face, before returning to the chest of drawers to replace\\nit. He follows her, apologizing.) Perhaps I'm quite wrong, you\\nknow: no doubt I am. Most likely he had got wind of the\\ncartridge business somehow, and knew it was a safe job.\\n\\nRAINA. That is to say, he was a pretender and a coward! You did\\nnot dare say that before.\\n\\nMAN (with a comic gesture of despair). It's no use, dear lady:\\nI can't make you see it from the professional point of view. (As\\nhe turns away to get back to the ottoman, the firing begins\\nagain in the distance.)\\n\\nRAINA (sternly, as she sees him listening to the shots). So\\nmuch the better for you.\\n\\nMAN (turning). How?\\n\\nRAINA. You are my enemy; and you are at my mercy. What would I\\ndo if I were a professional soldier?\\n\\nMAN. Ah, true, dear young lady: you're always right. I know how\\ngood you have been to me: to my last hour I shall remember those\\nthree chocolate creams. It was unsoldierly; but it was angelic.\\n\\nRAINA (coldly). Thank you. And now I will do a soldierly thing.\\nYou cannot stay here after what you have just said about my\\nfuture husband; but I will go out on the balcony and see whether\\nit is safe for you to climb down into the street. (She turns to\\nthe window.)\\n\\nMAN (changing countenance). Down that waterpipe! Stop! Wait! I\\ncan't! I daren't! The very thought of it makes me giddy. I came\\nup it fast enough with death behind me. But to face it now in\\ncold blood!--(He sinks on the ottoman.) It's no use: I give up:\\nI'm beaten. Give the alarm. (He drops his head in his hands in\\nthe deepest dejection.)\\n\\nRAINA (disarmed by pity). Come, don't be disheartened. (She\\nstoops over him almost maternally: he shakes his head.) Oh, you\\nare a very poor soldier--a chocolate cream soldier. Come, cheer\\nup: it takes less courage to climb down than to face\\ncapture--remember that.\\n\\nMAN (dreamily, lulled by her voice). No, capture only means\\ndeath; and death is sleep--oh, sleep, sleep, sleep, undisturbed\\nsleep! Climbing down the pipe means doing something--exerting\\nmyself--thinking! Death ten times over first.\\n\\nRAINA (softly and wonderingly, catching the rhythm of his\\nweariness). Are you so sleepy as that?\\n\\nMAN. I've not had two hours' undisturbed sleep since the war\\nbegan. I'm on the staff: you don't know what that means. I\\nhaven't closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.\\n\\nRAINA (desperately). But what am I to do with you.\\n\\nMAN (staggering up). Of course I must do something. (He shakes\\nhimself; pulls himself together; and speaks with rallied vigour\\nand courage.) You see, sleep or no sleep, hunger or no hunger,\\ntired or not tired, you can always do a thing when you know it\\nmust be done. Well, that pipe must be got down--(He hits himself\\non the chest, and adds)--Do you hear that, you chocolate cream\\nsoldier? (He turns to the window.)\\n\\nRAINA (anxiously). But if you fall?\\n\\nMAN. I shall sleep as if the stones were a feather bed.\\nGood-bye. (He makes boldly for the window, and his hand is on\\nthe shutter when there is a terrible burst of firing in the\\nstreet beneath.)\\n\\nRAINA (rushing to him). Stop! (She catches him by the shoulder,\\nand turns him quite round.) They'll kill you.\\n\\nMAN (coolly, but attentively). Never mind: this sort of thing\\nis all in my day's work. I'm bound to take my chance.\\n(Decisively.) Now do what I tell you. Put out the candles, so\\nthat they shan't see the light when I open the shutters. And\\nkeep away from the window, whatever you do. If they see me,\\nthey're sure to have a shot at me.\\n\\nRAINA (clinging to him). They're sure to see you: it's bright\\nmoonlight. I'll save you--oh, how can you be so indifferent? You\\nwant me to save you, don't you?\\n\\nMAN. I really don't want to be troublesome. (She shakes him in\\nher impatience.) I am not indifferent, dear young lady, I assure\\nyou. But how is it to be done?\\n\\nRAINA. Come away from the window--please. (She coaxes him back\\nto the middle of the room. He submits humbly. She releases him,\\nand addresses him patronizingly.) Now listen. You must trust to\\nour hospitality. You do not yet know in whose house you are. I\\nam a Petkoff.\\n\\nMAN. What's that?\\n\\nRAINA (rather indignantly). I mean that I belong to the family\\nof the Petkoffs, the richest and best known in our country.\\n\\nMAN. Oh, yes, of course. I beg your pardon. The Petkoffs, to be\\nsure. How stupid of me!\\n\\nRAINA. You know you never heard of them until this minute. How\\ncan you stoop to pretend?\\n\\nMAN. Forgive me: I'm too tired to think; and the change of\\nsubject was too much for me. Don't scold me.\\n\\nRAINA. I forgot. It might make you cry. (He nods, quite\\nseriously. She pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone.) I\\nmust tell you that my father holds the highest command of any\\nBulgarian in our army. He is (proudly) a Major.\\n\\nMAN (pretending to be deeply impressed). A Major! Bless me!\\nThink of that!\\n\\nRAINA. You shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was\\nnecessary to climb up to the balcony, because ours is the only\\nprivate house that has two rows of windows. There is a flight of\\nstairs inside to get up and down by.\\n\\nMAN. Stairs! How grand! You live in great luxury indeed, dear\\nyoung lady.\\n\\nRAINA. Do you know what a library is?\\n\\nMAN. A library? A roomful of books.\\n\\nRAINA. Yes, we have one, the only one in Bulgaria.\\n\\nMAN. Actually a real library! I should like to see that.\\n\\nRAINA (affectedly). I tell you these things to shew you that\\nyou are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill\\nyou the moment they saw your Servian uniform, but among\\ncivilized people. We go to Bucharest every year for the opera\\nseason; and I have spent a whole month in Vienna.\\n\\nMAN. I saw that, dear young lady. I saw at once that you knew\\nthe world.\\n\\nRAINA. Have you ever seen the opera of Ernani?\\n\\nMAN. Is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet, and a\\nsoldier's chorus?\\n\\nRAINA (contemptuously). No!\\n\\nMAN (stifling a heavy sigh of weariness). Then I don't know it.\\n\\nRAINA. I thought you might have remembered the great scene where\\nErnani, flying from his foes just as you are tonight, takes\\nrefuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy, an old Castilian\\nnoble. The noble refuses to give him up. His guest is sacred to\\nhim.\\n\\nMAN (quickly waking up a little). Have your people got that\\nnotion?\\n\\nRAINA (with dignity). My mother and I can understand that\\nnotion, as you call it. And if instead of threatening me with\\nyour pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a\\nfugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as safe as in\\nyour father's house.\\n\\nMAN. Quite sure?\\n\\nRAINA (turning her back on him in disgust.) Oh, it is useless\\nto try and make you understand.\\n\\nMAN. Don't be angry: you see how awkward it would be for me if\\nthere was any mistake. My father is a very hospitable man: he\\nkeeps six hotels; but I couldn't trust him as far as that. What\\nabout YOUR father?\\n\\nRAINA. He is away at Slivnitza fighting for his country. I\\nanswer for your safety. There is my hand in pledge of it. Will\\nthat reassure you? (She offers him her hand.)\\n\\nMAN (looking dubiously at his own hand). Better not touch my\\nhand, dear young lady. I must have a wash first.\\n\\nRAINA (touched). That is very nice of you. I see that you are a\\ngentleman.\\n\\nMAN (puzzled). Eh?\\n\\nRAINA. You must not think I am surprised. Bulgarians of really\\ngood standing--people in OUR position--wash their hands nearly\\nevery day. But I appreciate your delicacy. You may take my hand.\\n(She offers it again.)\\n\\nMAN (kissing it with his hands behind his back). Thanks,\\ngracious young lady: I feel safe at last. And now would you mind\\nbreaking the news to your mother? I had better not stay here\\nsecretly longer than is necessary.\\n\\nRAINA. If you will be so good as to keep perfectly still whilst\\nI am away.\\n\\nMAN. Certainly. (He sits down on the ottoman.)\\n\\n   (Raina goes to the bed and wraps herself in the\\n    fur cloak. His eyes close. She goes to the door,\\n    but on turning for a last look at him, sees that\\n    he is dropping of to sleep.)\\n\\nRAINA (at the door). You are not going asleep, are you?\\n(He murmurs inarticulately: she runs to him and shakes him.)\\nDo you hear? Wake up: you are falling asleep.\\n\\nMAN. Eh? Falling aslee--? Oh, no, not the least in\\nthe world: I was only thinking. It's all right: I'm wide\\nawake.\\n\\nRAINA (severely). Will you please stand up while I am\\naway. (He rises reluctantly.) All the time, mind.\\n\\nMAN (standing unsteadily). Certainly--certainly: you\\nmay depend on me.\\n\\n    (Raina looks doubtfully at him. He smiles\\n     foolishly. She goes reluctantly, turning\\n     again at the door, and almost catching him\\n     in the act of yawning. She goes out.)\\n\\nMAN (drowsily). Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, slee--(The\\nwords trail off into a murmur. He wakes again with a\\nshock on the point of falling.) Where am I? That's what\\nI want to know: where am I? Must keep awake. Nothing\\nkeeps me awake except danger--remember that--(intently)\\ndanger, danger, danger, dan-- Where's danger? Must\\nfind it. (He starts of vaguely around the room in search of\\nit.) What am I looking for? Sleep--danger--don't know.\\n(He stumbles against the bed.) Ah, yes: now I know. All\\nright now. I'm to go to bed, but not to sleep--be sure\\nnot to sleep--because of danger. Not to lie down, either,\\nonly sit down. (He sits on the bed. A blissful expression\\ncomes into his face.) Ah! (With a happy sigh he sinks back\\nat full length; lifts his boots into the bed with a final\\neffort; and falls fast asleep instantly.)\\n\\n    (Catherine comes in, followed by Raina.)\\n\\nRAINA (looking at the ottoman). He's gone! I left him\\nhere.\\n\\nCATHERINE, Here! Then he must have climbed down from the--\\n\\nRAINA (seeing him). Oh! (She points.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (scandalized). Well! (She strides to the left\\nside of the bed, Raina following and standing opposite her on\\nthe right.) He's fast asleep. The brute!\\n\\nRAINA (anxiously). Sh!\\n\\nCATHERINE (shaking him). Sir! (Shaking him again,\\nharder.) Sir!! (Vehemently shaking very bard.) Sir!!!\\n\\nRAINA (catching her arm). Don't, mamma: the poor dear\\nis worn out. Let him sleep.\\n\\nCATHERINE (letting him go and turning amazed to Raina).\\nThe poor dear! Raina!!! (She looks sternly at her\\ndaughter. The man sleeps profoundly.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\n\\n    The sixth of March, 1886. In the garden of major\\n    Petkoff's house. It is a fine spring morning; and\\n    the garden looks fresh and pretty. Beyond the\\n    paling the tops of a couple of minarets can be\\n    seen, shewing that there is a valley there, with\\n    the little town in it. A few miles further the\\n    Balkan mountains rise and shut in the view. Within\\n    the garden the side of the house is seen on the\\n    right, with a garden door reached by a little\\n    flight of steps. On the left the stable yard, with\\n    its gateway, encroaches on the garden. There are\\n    fruit bushes along the paling and house, covered\\n    with washing hung out to dry. A path runs by the\\n    house, and rises by two steps at the corner where\\n    it turns out of the right along the front. In the\\n    middle a small table, with two bent wood chairs at\\n    it, is laid for breakfast with Turkish coffee pot,\\n    cups, rolls, etc.; but the cups have been used and\\n    the bread broken. There is a wooden garden seat\\n    against the wall on the left.\\n\\n    Louka, smoking a cigaret, is standing between the\\n    table and the house, turning her back with angry\\n    disdain on a man-servant who is lecturing her. He\\n    is a middle-aged man of cool temperament and low\\n    but clear and keen intelligence, with the\\n    complacency of the servant who values himself on\\n    his rank in servility, and the imperturbability of\\n    the accurate calculator who has no illusions. He\\n    wears a white Bulgarian costume jacket with\\n    decorated border, sash, wide knickerbockers, and\\n    decorated gaiters. His head is shaved up to the\\n    crown, giving him a high Japanese forehead. His\\n    name is Nicola.\\n\\nNICOLA. Be warned in time, Louka: mend your manners. I know the\\nmistress. She is so grand that she never dreams that any servant\\ncould dare to be disrespectful to her; but if she once suspects\\nthat you are defying her, out you go.\\n\\nLOUKA. I do defy her. I will defy her. What do I care for her?\\n\\nNICOLA. If you quarrel with the family, I never can marry you.\\nIt's the same as if you quarrelled with me!\\n\\nLOUKA. You take her part against me, do you?\\n\\nNICOLA (sedately). I shall always be dependent on the good will\\nof the family. When I leave their service and start a shop in\\nSofia, their custom will be half my capital: their bad word\\nwould ruin me.\\n\\nLOUKA. You have no spirit. I should like to see them dare say a\\nword against me!\\n\\nNICOLA (pityingly). I should have expected more sense from you,\\nLouka. But you're young, you're young!\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes; and you like me the better for it, don't you? But I\\nknow some family secrets they wouldn't care to have told, young\\nas I am. Let them quarrel with me if they dare!\\n\\nNICOLA (with compassionate superiority). Do you know what they\\nwould do if they heard you talk like that?\\n\\nLOUKA. What could they do?\\n\\nNICOLA. Discharge you for untruthfulness. Who would believe any\\nstories you told after that? Who would give you another\\nsituation? Who in this house would dare be seen speaking to you\\never again? How long would your father be left on his little\\nfarm? (She impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret, and\\nstamps on it.) Child, you don't know the power such high people\\nhave over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our\\npoverty against them. (He goes close to her and lowers his\\nvoice.) Look at me, ten years in their service. Do you think I\\nknow no secrets? I know things about the mistress that she\\nwouldn't have the master know for a thousand levas. I know\\nthings about him that she wouldn't let him hear the last of for\\nsix months if I blabbed them to her. I know things about Raina\\nthat would break off her match with Sergius if--\\n\\nLOUKA (turning on him quickly). How do you know? I never told\\nyou!\\n\\nNICOLA (opening his eyes cunningly). So that's your little\\nsecret, is it? I thought it might be something like that. Well,\\nyou take my advice, and be respectful; and make the mistress\\nfeel that no matter what you know or don't know, they can depend\\non you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully.\\nThat's what they like; and that's how you'll make most out of\\nthem.\\n\\nLOUKA (with searching scorn). You have the soul of a servant,\\nNicola.\\n\\nNICOLA (complacently). Yes: that's the secret of success in\\nservice.\\n\\n    (A loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden\\n     door, outside on the left, is heard.)\\n\\nMALE VOICE OUTSIDE. Hollo! Hollo there! Nicola!\\n\\nLOUKA. Master! back from the war!\\n\\nNICOLA (quickly). My word for it, Louka, the war's over. Off\\nwith you and get some fresh coffee. (He runs out into the stable\\nyard.)\\n\\nLOUKA (as she puts the coffee pot and the cups upon the tray,\\nand carries it into the house). You'll never put the soul of a\\nservant into me.\\n\\n   (Major Petkoff comes from the stable yard,\\n    followed by Nicola. He is a cheerful, excitable,\\n    insignificant, unpolished man of about 50,\\n    naturally unambitious except as to his income and\\n    his importance in local society, but just now\\n    greatly pleased with the military rank which the\\n    war has thrust on him as a man of consequence in\\n    his town. The fever of plucky patriotism which the\\n    Servian attack roused in all the Bulgarians has\\n    pulled him through the war; but he is obviously\\n    glad to be home again.)\\n\\nPETKOFF (pointing to the table with his whip). Breakfast out\\nhere, eh?\\n\\nNICOLA. Yes, sir. The mistress and Miss Raina have just gone in.\\n\\nPETKOFF (fitting down and taking a roll). Go in and say I've\\ncome; and get me some fresh coffee.\\n\\nNICOLA. It's coming, sir. (He goes to the house door. Louka,\\nwith fresh coffee, a clean cup, and a brandy bottle on her tray\\nmeets him.) Have you told the mistress?\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes: she's coming.\\n\\n    (Nicola goes into the house. Louka brings the\\n     coffee to the table.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. Well, the Servians haven't run away with you, have\\nthey?\\n\\nLOUKA. No, sir.\\n\\nPETKOFF. That's right. Have you brought me some cognac?\\n\\nLOUKA (putting the bottle on the table). Here, sir.\\n\\nPETKOFF. That's right. (He pours some into his coffee.)\\n\\n   (Catherine who has at this early hour made only a\\n    very perfunctory toilet, and wears a Bulgarian\\n    apron over a once brilliant, but now half worn out\\n    red dressing gown, and a colored handkerchief tied\\n    over her thick black hair, with Turkish slippers\\n    on her bare feet, comes from the house, looking\\n    astonishingly handsome and stately under all the\\n    circumstances. Louka goes into the house.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. My dear Paul, what a surprise for us. (She stoops\\nover the back of his chair to kiss him.) Have they brought you\\nfresh coffee?\\n\\nPETKOFF. Yes, Louka's been looking after me. The war's over. The\\ntreaty was signed three days ago at Bucharest; and the decree\\nfor our army to demobilize was issued yesterday.\\n\\nCATHERINE (springing erect, with flashing eyes). The war over!\\nPaul: have you let the Austrians force you to make peace?\\n\\nPETKOFF (submissively). My dear: they didn't consult me. What\\ncould _I_ do? (She sits down and turns away from him.) But of\\ncourse we saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one. It\\ndeclares peace--\\n\\nCATHERINE (outraged). Peace!\\n\\nPETKOFF (appeasing her).--but not friendly relations: remember\\nthat. They wanted to put that in; but I insisted on its being\\nstruck out. What more could I do?\\n\\nCATHERINE. You could have annexed Servia and made Prince\\nAlexander Emperor of the Balkans. That's what I would have done.\\n\\nPETKOFF. I don't doubt it in the least, my dear. But I should\\nhave had to subdue the whole Austrian Empire first; and that\\nwould have kept me too long away from you. I missed you greatly.\\n\\nCATHERINE (relenting). Ah! (Stretches her hand affectionately\\nacross the table to squeeze his.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. And how have you been, my dear?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, my usual sore throats, that's all.\\n\\nPETKOFF (with conviction). That comes from washing your neck\\nevery day. I've often told you so.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Nonsense, Paul!\\n\\nPETKOFF (over his coffee and cigaret). I don't believe in going\\ntoo far with these modern customs. All this washing can't be\\ngood for the health: it's not natural. There was an Englishman\\nat Phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold\\nwater every morning when he got up. Disgusting! It all comes\\nfrom the English: their climate makes them so dirty that they\\nhave to be perpetually washing themselves. Look at my father: he\\nnever had a bath in his life; and he lived to be ninety-eight,\\nthe healthiest man in Bulgaria. I don't mind a good wash once a\\nweek to keep up my position; but once a day is carrying the\\nthing to a ridiculous extreme.\\n\\nCATHERINE. You are a barbarian at heart still, Paul. I hope you\\nbehaved yourself before all those Russian officers.\\n\\nPETKOFF. I did my best. I took care to let them know that we had\\na library.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Ah; but you didn't tell them that we have an electric\\nbell in it? I have had one put up.\\n\\nPETKOFF. What's an electric bell?\\n\\nCATHERINE. You touch a button; something tinkles in the kitchen;\\nand then Nicola comes up.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Why not shout for him?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Civilized people never shout for their servants. I've\\nlearnt that while you were away.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Well, I'll tell you something I've learnt, too.\\nCivilized people don't hang out their washing to dry where\\nvisitors can see it; so you'd better have all that (indicating\\nthe clothes on the bushes) put somewhere else.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, that's absurd, Paul: I don't believe really\\nrefined people notice such things.\\n\\n    (Someone is heard knocking at the stable gates.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. There's Sergius. (Shouting.) Hollo, Nicola!\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, don't shout, Paul: it really isn't nice.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Bosh! (He shouts louder than before.) Nicola!\\n\\nNICOLA (appearing at the house door). Yes, sir.\\n\\nPETKOFF. If that is Major Saranoff, bring him round this way.\\n(He pronounces the name with the stress on the second\\nsyllable--Sarah-noff.)\\n\\nNICOLA. Yes, sir. (He goes into the stable yard.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. You must talk to him, my dear, until Raina takes him\\noff our hands. He bores my life out about our not promoting\\nhim--over my head, mind you.\\n\\nCATHERINE. He certainly ought to be promoted when he marries\\nRaina. Besides, the country should insist on having at least one\\nnative general.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Yes, so that he could throw away whole brigades instead\\nof regiments. It's no use, my dear: he has not the slightest\\nchance of promotion until we are quite sure that the peace will\\nbe a lasting one.\\n\\nNICOLA (at the gate, announcing). Major Sergius Saranoff! (He\\ngoes into the house and returns presently with a third chair,\\nwhich he places at the table. He then withdraws.)\\n\\n   (Major Sergius Saranoff, the original of the\\n    portrait in Raina's room, is a tall, romantically\\n    handsome man, with the physical hardihood, the\\n    high spirit, and the susceptible imagination of an\\n    untamed mountaineer chieftain. But his remarkable\\n    personal distinction is of a characteristically\\n    civilized type. The ridges of his eyebrows,\\n    curving with a ram's-horn twist round the marked\\n    projections at the outer corners, his jealously\\n    observant eye, his nose, thin, keen, and\\n    apprehensive in spite of the pugnacious high\\n    bridge and large nostril, his assertive chin,\\n    would not be out of place in a Paris salon. In\\n    short, the clever, imaginative barbarian has an\\n    acute critical faculty which has been thrown into\\n    intense activity by the arrival of western\\n    civilization in the Balkans; and the result is\\n    precisely what the advent of nineteenth-century\\n    thought first produced in England: to-wit,\\n    Byronism. By his brooding on the perpetual\\n    failure, not only of others, but of himself, to\\n    live up to his imaginative ideals, his consequent\\n    cynical scorn for humanity, the jejune credulity\\n    as to the absolute validity of his ideals and the\\n    unworthiness of the world in disregarding them,\\n    his wincings and mockeries under the sting of the\\n    petty disillusions which every hour spent among\\n    men brings to his infallibly quick observation, he\\n    has acquired the half tragic, half ironic air, the\\n    mysterious moodiness, the suggestion of a strange\\n    and terrible history that has left him nothing but\\n    undying remorse, by which Childe Harold fascinated\\n    the grandmothers of his English contemporaries.\\n    Altogether it is clear that here or nowhere is\\n    Raina's ideal hero. Catherine is hardly less\\n    enthusiastic, and much less reserved in shewing\\n    her enthusiasm. As he enters from the stable gate,\\n    she rises effusively to greet him. Petkoff is\\n    distinctly less disposed to make a fuss about\\n    him.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. Here already, Sergius. Glad to see you!\\n\\nCATHERINE. My dear Sergius!(She holds out both her hands.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (kissing them with scrupulous gallantry). My dear\\nmother, if I may call you so.\\n\\nPETKOFF (drily). Mother-in-law, Sergius; mother-in-law! Sit\\ndown, and have some coffee.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Thank you, none for me. (He gets away from the table\\nwith a certain distaste for Petkoff's enjoyment of it, and posts\\nhimself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps\\nleading to the house.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. You look superb--splendid. The campaign has improved\\nyou. Everybody here is mad about you. We were all wild with\\nenthusiasm about that magnificent cavalry charge.\\n\\nSERGIUS (with grave irony). Madam: it was the cradle and the\\ngrave of my military reputation.\\n\\nCATHERINE. How so?\\n\\nSERGIUS. I won the battle the wrong way when our worthy Russian\\ngenerals were losing it the right way. That upset their plans,\\nand wounded their self-esteem. Two of their colonels got their\\nregiments driven back on the correct principles of scientific\\nwarfare. Two major-generals got killed strictly according to\\nmilitary etiquette. Those two colonels are now major-generals;\\nand I am still a simple major.\\n\\nCATHERINE. You shall not remain so, Sergius. The women are on\\nyour side; and they will see that justice is done you.\\n\\nSERGIUS. It is too late. I have only waited for the peace to\\nsend in my resignation.\\n\\nPETKOFF (dropping his cup in his amazement). Your resignation!\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, you must withdraw it!\\n\\nSERGIUS (with resolute, measured emphasis, folding his arms). I\\nnever withdraw!\\n\\nPETKOFF (vexed). Now who could have supposed you were going to\\ndo such a thing?\\n\\nSERGIUS (with fire). Everyone that knew me. But enough of\\nmyself and my affairs. How is Raina; and where is Raina?\\n\\nRAINA (suddenly coming round the corner of the house and\\nstanding at the top of the steps in the path). Raina is here.\\n(She makes a charming picture as they all turn to look at her.\\nShe wears an underdress of pale green silk, draped with an\\noverdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold. On her head\\nshe wears a pretty Phrygian cap of gold tinsel. Sergius, with an\\nexclamation of pleasure, goes impulsively to meet her. She\\nstretches out her hand: he drops chivalrously on one knee and\\nkisses it.)\\n\\nPETKOFF (aside to Catherine, beaming with parental pride).\\nPretty, isn't it? She always appears at the right moment.\\n\\nCATHERINE (impatiently). Yes: she listens for it. It is an\\nabominable habit.\\n\\n    (Sergius leads Raina forward with splendid gallantry,\\n     as if she were a queen. When they come to the\\n     table, she turns to him with a bend of the head;\\n     he bows; and thus they separate, he coming to his\\n     place, and she going behind her father's chair.)\\n\\nRAINA (stooping and kissing her father). Dear father! Welcome\\nhome!\\n\\nPETKOFF (patting her cheek). My little pet girl. (He kisses\\nher; she goes to the chair left by Nicola for Sergius, and sits\\ndown.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. And so you're no longer a soldier, Sergius.\\n\\nSERGIUS. I am no longer a soldier. Soldiering, my dear madam, is\\nthe coward's art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong,\\nand keeping out of harm's way when you are weak. That is the\\nwhole secret of successful fighting. Get your enemy at a\\ndisadvantage; and never, on any account, fight him on equal\\nterms. Eh, Major!\\n\\nPETKOFF. They wouldn't let us make a fair stand-up fight of it.\\nHowever, I suppose soldiering has to be a trade like any other\\ntrade.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Precisely. But I have no ambition to succeed as a\\ntradesman; so I have taken the advice of that bagman of a\\ncaptain that settled the exchange of prisoners with us at\\nPeerot, and given it up.\\n\\nPETKOFF. What, that Swiss fellow? Sergius: I've often thought of\\nthat exchange since. He over-reached us about those horses.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Of course he over-reached us. His father was a hotel\\nand livery stable keeper; and he owed his first step to his\\nknowledge of horse-dealing. (With mock enthusiasm.) Ah, he was a\\nsoldier--every inch a soldier! If only I had bought the horses\\nfor my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger, I\\nshould have been a field-marshal now!\\n\\nCATHERINE. A Swiss? What was he doing in the Servian army?\\n\\nPETKOFF. A volunteer of course--keen on picking up his\\nprofession. (Chuckling.) We shouldn't have been able to begin\\nfighting if these foreigners hadn't shewn us how to do it: we\\nknew nothing about it; and neither did the Servians. Egad,\\nthere'd have been no war without them.\\n\\nRAINA. Are there many Swiss officers in the Servian Army?\\n\\nPETKOFF. No--all Austrians, just as our officers were all\\nRussians. This was the only Swiss I came across. I'll never\\ntrust a Swiss again. He cheated us--humbugged us into giving\\nhim fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out\\nchargers. They weren't even eatable!\\n\\nSERGIUS. We were two children in the hands of that consummate\\nsoldier, Major: simply two innocent little children.\\n\\nRAINA. What was he like?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, Raina, what a silly question!\\n\\nSERGIUS. He was like a commercial traveller in uniform.\\nBourgeois to his boots.\\n\\nPETKOFF (grinning). Sergius: tell Catherine that queer story\\nhis friend told us about him--how he escaped after Slivnitza.\\nYou remember?--about his being hid by two women.\\n\\nSERGIUS (with bitter irony). Oh, yes, quite a romance. He was\\nserving in the very battery I so unprofessionally charged. Being\\na thorough soldier, he ran away like the rest of them, with our\\ncavalry at his heels. To escape their attentions, he had the\\ngood taste to take refuge in the chamber of some patriotic young\\nBulgarian lady. The young lady was enchanted by his persuasive\\ncommercial traveller's manners. She very modestly entertained\\nhim for an hour or so and then called in her mother lest her\\nconduct should appear unmaidenly. The old lady was equally\\nfascinated; and the fugitive was sent on his way in the morning,\\ndisguised in an old coat belonging to the master of the house,\\nwho was away at the war.\\n\\nRAINA (rising with marked stateliness). Your life in the camp\\nhas made you coarse, Sergius. I did not think you would have\\nrepeated such a story before me. (She turns away coldly.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (also rising). She is right, Sergius. If such women\\nexist, we should be spared the knowledge of them.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Pooh! nonsense! what does it matter?\\n\\nSERGIUS (ashamed). No, Petkoff: I was wrong. (To Raina, with\\nearnest humility.) I beg your pardon. I have behaved abominably.\\nForgive me, Raina. (She bows reservedly.) And you, too, madam.\\n(Catherine bows graciously and sits down. He proceeds solemnly,\\nagain addressing Raina.) The glimpses I have had of the seamy\\nside of life during the last few months have made me cynical;\\nbut I should not have brought my cynicism here--least of all\\ninto your presence, Raina. I--(Here, turning to the others, he\\nis evidently about to begin a long speech when the Major\\ninterrupts him.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. Stuff and nonsense, Sergius. That's quite enough fuss\\nabout nothing: a soldier's daughter should be able to stand up\\nwithout flinching to a little strong conversation. (He rises.)\\nCome: it's time for us to get to business. We have to make up\\nour minds how those three regiments are to get back to\\nPhillipopolis:--there's no forage for them on the Sofia route.\\n(He goes towards the house.) Come along. (Sergius is about to\\nfollow him when Catherine rises and intervenes.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, Paul, can't you spare Sergius for a few moments?\\nRaina has hardly seen him yet. Perhaps I can help you to settle\\nabout the regiments.\\n\\nSERGIUS (protesting). My dear madam, impossible: you--\\n\\nCATHERINE (stopping him playfully). You stay here, my dear\\nSergius: there's no hurry. I have a word or two to say to Paul.\\n(Sergius instantly bows and steps back.) Now, dear (taking\\nPetkoff's arm), come and see the electric bell.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Oh, very well, very well. (They go into the house\\ntogether affectionately. Sergius, left alone with Raina, looks\\nanxiously at her, fearing that she may be still offended. She\\nsmiles, and stretches out her arms to him.)\\n\\n    (Exit R. into house, followed by Catherine.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (hastening to her, but refraining from touching her\\nwithout express permission). Am I forgiven?\\n\\nRAINA (placing her hands on his shoulder as she looks up at him\\nwith admiration and worship). My hero! My king.\\n\\nSERGIUS. My queen! (He kisses her on the forehead with holy\\nawe.)\\n\\nRAINA. How I have envied you, Sergius! You have been out in the\\nworld, on the field of battle, able to prove yourself there\\nworthy of any woman in the world; whilst I have had to sit at\\nhome inactive,--dreaming--useless--doing nothing that could\\ngive me the right to call myself worthy of any man.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Dearest, all my deeds have been yours. You inspired me.\\nI have gone through the war like a knight in a tournament with\\nhis lady looking on at him!\\n\\nRAINA. And you have never been absent from my thoughts for a\\nmoment. (Very solemnly.) Sergius: I think we two have found the\\nhigher love. When I think of you, I feel that I could never do a\\nbase deed, or think an ignoble thought.\\n\\nSERGIUS. My lady, and my saint! (Clasping her reverently.)\\n\\nRAINA (returning his embrace). My lord and my g--\\n\\nSERGIUS. Sh--sh! Let me be the worshipper, dear. You little know\\nhow unworthy even the best man is of a girl's pure passion!\\n\\nRAINA. I trust you. I love you. You will never disappoint me,\\nSergius. (Louka is heard singing within the house. They quickly\\nrelease each other.) Hush! I can't pretend to talk indifferently\\nbefore her: my heart is too full. (Louka comes from the house\\nwith her tray. She goes to the table, and begins to clear it,\\nwith her back turned to them.) I will go and get my hat; and\\nthen we can go out until lunch time. Wouldn't you like that?\\n\\nSERGIUS. Be quick. If you are away five minutes, it will seem\\nfive hours. (Raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there\\nto exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands.\\nHe looks after her with emotion for a moment, then turns slowly\\naway, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which\\nhas just passed. The movement shifts his field of vision, into\\nthe corner of which there now comes the tail of Louka's double\\napron. His eye gleams at once. He takes a stealthy look at her,\\nand begins to twirl his moustache nervously, with his left hand\\nakimbo on his hip. Finally, striking the ground with his heels\\nin something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left\\nof the table, opposite her, and says) Louka: do you know what\\nthe higher love is?\\n\\nLOUKA (astonished). No, sir.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time,\\nLouka. One feels the need of some relief after it.\\n\\nLOUKA (innocently). Perhaps you would like some coffee, sir?\\n(She stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (taking her hand). Thank you, Louka.\\n\\nLOUKA (pretending to pull). Oh, sir, you know I didn't mean\\nthat. I'm surprised at you!\\n\\nSERGIUS (coming clear of the table and drawing her with him). I\\nam surprised at myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of\\nSlivnitza, say if he saw me now? What would Sergius, the apostle\\nof the higher love, say if he saw me now? What would the half\\ndozen Sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome\\nfigure of mine say if they caught us here? (Letting go her hand\\nand slipping his arm dexterously round her waist.) Do you\\nconsider my figure handsome, Louka?\\n\\nLOUKA. Let me go, sir. I shall be disgraced. (She struggles: he\\nholds her inexorably.) Oh, will you let go?\\n\\nSERGIUS (looking straight into her eyes). No.\\n\\nLOUKA. Then stand back where we can't be seen. Have you no\\ncommon sense?\\n\\nSERGIUS. Ah, that's reasonable. (He takes her into the\\nstableyard gateway, where they are hidden from the house.)\\n\\nLOUKA (complaining). I may have been seen from the windows:\\nMiss Raina is sure to be spying about after you.\\n\\nSERGIUS (stung--letting her go). Take care, Louka. I may be\\nworthless enough to betray the higher love; but do not you\\ninsult it.\\n\\nLOUKA (demurely). Not for the world, sir, I'm sure. May I go on\\nwith my work please, now?\\n\\nSERGIUS (again putting his arm round her). You are a provoking\\nlittle witch, Louka. If you were in love with me, would you spy\\nout of windows on me?\\n\\nLOUKA. Well, you see, sir, since you say you are half a dozen\\ndifferent gentlemen all at once, I should have a great deal to\\nlook after.\\n\\nSERGIUS (charmed). Witty as well as pretty. (He tries to kiss\\nher.)\\n\\nLOUKA (avoiding him). No, I don't want your kisses. Gentlefolk\\nare all alike--you making love to me behind Miss Raina's back,\\nand she doing the same behind yours.\\n\\nSERGIUS (recoiling a step). Louka!\\n\\nLOUKA. It shews how little you really care!\\n\\nSERGIUS (dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing\\npoliteness). If our conversation is to continue, Louka, you will\\nplease remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of\\nthe lady he is engaged to with her maid.\\n\\nLOUKA. It's so hard to know what a gentleman considers right. I\\nthought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being\\nso particular.\\n\\nSERGIUS (turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes\\nback into the garden from the gateway). Devil! devil!\\n\\nLOUKA. Ha! ha! I expect one of the six of you is very like me,\\nsir, though I am only Miss Raina's maid. (She goes back to her\\nwork at the table, taking no further notice of him.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (speaking to himself). Which of the six is the real\\nman?--that's the question that torments me. One of them is a\\nhero, another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a\\nbit of a blackguard. (He pauses and looks furtively at Louka, as\\nhe adds with deep bitterness) And one, at least, is a\\ncoward--jealous, like all cowards. (He goes to the table.)\\nLouka.\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes?\\n\\nSERGIUS. Who is my rival?\\n\\nLOUKA. You shall never get that out of me, for love or money.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Why?\\n\\nLOUKA. Never mind why. Besides, you would tell that I told you;\\nand I should lose my place.\\n\\nSERGIUS (holding out his right hand in affirmation). No; on the\\nhonor of a--(He checks himself, and his hand drops nerveless as\\nhe concludes, sardonically)--of a man capable of behaving as I\\nhave been behaving for the last five minutes. Who is he?\\n\\nLOUKA. I don't know. I never saw him. I only heard his voice\\nthrough the door of her room.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Damnation! How dare you?\\n\\nLOUKA (retreating). Oh, I mean no harm: you've no right to take\\nup my words like that. The mistress knows all about it. And I\\ntell you that if that gentleman ever comes here again, Miss\\nRaina will marry him, whether he likes it or not. I know the\\ndifference between the sort of manner you and she put on before\\none another and the real manner. (Sergius shivers as if she had\\nstabbed him. Then, setting his face like iron, he strides grimly\\nto her, and grips her above the elbows with both bands.)\\n\\nSERGIUS. Now listen you to me!\\n\\nLOUKA (wincing). Not so tight: you're hurting me!\\n\\nSERGIUS. That doesn't matter. You have stained my honor by\\nmaking me a party to your eavesdropping. And you have betrayed\\nyour mistress--\\n\\nLOUKA (writhing). Please--\\n\\nSERGIUS. That shews that you are an abominable little clod of\\ncommon clay, with the soul of a servant. (He lets her go as if\\nshe were an unclean thing, and turns away, dusting his hands of\\nher, to the bench by the wall, where he sits down with averted\\nhead, meditating gloomily.)\\n\\nLOUKA (whimpering angrily with her hands up her sleeves,\\nfeeling her bruised arms). You know how to hurt with your tongue\\nas well as with your hands. But I don't care, now I've found out\\nthat whatever clay I'm made of, you're made of the same. As for\\nher, she's a liar; and her fine airs are a cheat; and I'm worth\\nsix of her. (She shakes the pain off hardily; tosses her head;\\nand sets to work to put the things on the tray. He looks\\ndoubtfully at her once or twice. She finishes packing the tray,\\nand laps the cloth over the edges, so as to carry all out\\ntogether. As she stoops to lift it, he rises.)\\n\\nSERGIUS. Louka! (She stops and looks defiantly at him with the\\ntray in her hands.) A gentleman has no right to hurt a woman\\nunder any circumstances. (With profound humility, uncovering his\\nhead.) I beg your pardon.\\n\\nLOUKA. That sort of apology may satisfy a lady. Of what use is\\nit to a servant?\\n\\nSERGIUS (thus rudely crossed in his chivalry, throws it off\\nwith a bitter laugh and says slightingly). Oh, you wish to be\\npaid for the hurt? (He puts on his shako, and takes some money\\nfrom his pocket.)\\n\\nLOUKA (her eyes filling with tears in spite of herself). No, I\\nwant my hurt made well.\\n\\nSERGIUS (sobered by her tone). How?\\n\\n   (She rolls up her left sleeve; clasps her arm with\\n    the thumb and fingers of her right hand; and looks\\n    down at the bruise. Then she raises her head and\\n    looks straight at him. Finally, with a superb\\n    gesture she presents her arm to be kissed. Amazed,\\n    he looks at her; at the arm; at her again;\\n    hesitates; and then, with shuddering intensity,\\n    exclaims)\\n\\nSERGIUS. Never! (and gets away as far as possible from her.)\\n\\n   (Her arm drops. Without a word, and with unaffected\\n    dignity, she takes her tray, and is approaching\\n    the house when Raina returns wearing a hat and\\n    jacket in the height of the Vienna fashion of the\\n    previous year, 1885. Louka makes way proudly for\\n    her, and then goes into the house.)\\n\\nRAINA. I'm ready! What's the matter? (Gaily.) Have you been\\nflirting with Louka?\\n\\nSERGIUS (hastily). No, no. How can you think such a thing?\\n\\nRAINA (ashamed of herself). Forgive me, dear: it was only a\\njest. I am so happy to-day.\\n\\n    (He goes quickly to her, and kisses her hand\\n     remorsefully. Catherine comes out and calls\\n     to them from the top of the steps.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (coming down to them). I am sorry to disturb you,\\nchildren; but Paul is distracted over those three regiments. He\\ndoes not know how to get them to Phillipopolis; and he objects\\nto every suggestion of mine. You must go and help him, Sergius.\\nHe is in the library.\\n\\nRAINA (disappointed). But we are just going out for a walk.\\n\\nSERGIUS. I shall not be long. Wait for me just five minutes. (He\\nruns up the steps to the door.)\\n\\nRAINA (following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at\\nhim with timid coquetry). I shall go round and wait in full view\\nof the library windows. Be sure you draw father's attention to\\nme. If you are a moment longer than five minutes, I shall go in\\nand fetch you, regiments or no regiments.\\n\\nSERGIUS (laughing). Very well. (He goes in. Raina watches him\\nuntil he is out of her sight. Then, with a perceptible\\nrelaxation of manner, she begins to pace up and down about the\\ngarden in a brown study.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. Imagine their meeting that Swiss and hearing the\\nwhole story! The very first thing your father asked for was the\\nold coat we sent him off in. A nice mess you have got us into!\\n\\nRAINA (gazing thoughtfully at the gravel as she walks). The\\nlittle beast!\\n\\nCATHERINE. Little beast! What little beast?\\n\\nRAINA. To go and tell! Oh, if I had him here, I'd stuff him with\\nchocolate creams till he couldn't ever speak again!\\n\\nCATHERINE. Don't talk nonsense. Tell me the truth, Raina. How\\nlong was he in your room before you came to me?\\n\\nRAINA (whisking round and recommencing her march in the\\nopposite direction). Oh, I forget.\\n\\nCATHERINE. You cannot forget! Did he really climb up after the\\nsoldiers were gone, or was he there when that officer searched\\nthe room?\\n\\nRAINA. No. Yes, I think he must have been there then.\\n\\nCATHERINE. You think! Oh, Raina, Raina! Will anything ever make\\nyou straightforward? If Sergius finds out, it is all over\\nbetween you.\\n\\nRAINA (with cool impertinence). Oh, I know Sergius is your pet.\\nI sometimes wish you could marry him instead of me. You would\\njust suit him. You would pet him, and spoil him, and mother him\\nto perfection.\\n\\nCATHERINE (opening her eyes very widely indeed). Well, upon my\\nword!\\n\\nRAINA (capriciously--half to herself). I always feel a longing\\nto do or say something dreadful to him--to shock his\\npropriety--to scandalize the five senses out of him! (To\\nCatherine perversely.) I don't care whether he finds out about\\nthe chocolate cream soldier or not. I half hope he may. (She\\nagain turns flippantly away and strolls up the path to the\\ncorner of the house.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. And what should I be able to say to your father,\\npray?\\n\\nRAINA (over her shoulder, from the top of the two steps). Oh,\\npoor father! As if he could help himself! (She turns the corner\\nand passes out of sight.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (looking after her, her fingers itching). Oh, if you\\nwere only ten years younger! (Louka comes from the house with a\\nsalver, which she carries hanging down by her side.) Well?\\n\\nLOUKA. There's a gentleman just called, madam--a Servian\\nofficer--\\n\\nCATHERINE (flaming). A Servian! How dare he--(Checking herself\\nbitterly.) Oh, I forgot. We are at peace now. I suppose we shall\\nhave them calling every day to pay their compliments. Well, if\\nhe is an officer why don't you tell your master? He is in the\\nlibrary with Major Saranoff. Why do you come to me?\\n\\nLOUKA. But he asks for you, madam. And I don't think he knows\\nwho you are: he said the lady of the house. He gave me this\\nlittle ticket for you. (She takes a card out of her bosom; puts\\nit on the salver and offers it to Catherine.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (reading). \\\"Captain Bluntschli!\\\" That's a German\\nname.\\n\\nLOUKA. Swiss, madam, I think.\\n\\nCATHERINE (with a bound that makes Louka jump back). Swiss!\\nWhat is he like?\\n\\nLOUKA (timidly). He has a big carpet bag, madam.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, Heavens, he's come to return the coat! Send him\\naway--say we're not at home--ask him to leave his address and\\nI'll write to him--Oh, stop: that will never do. Wait! (She\\nthrows herself into a chair to think it out. Louka waits.) The\\nmaster and Major Saranoff are busy in the library, aren't they?\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes, madam.\\n\\nCATHERINE (decisively). Bring the gentleman out here at once.\\n(Imperatively.) And be very polite to him. Don't delay. Here\\n(impatiently snatching the salver from her): leave that here;\\nand go straight back to him.\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes, madam. (Going.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. Louka!\\n\\nLOUKA (stopping). Yes, madam.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Is the library door shut?\\n\\nLOUKA. I think so, madam.\\n\\nCATHERINE. If not, shut it as you pass through.\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes, madam. (Going.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. Stop! (Louka stops.) He will have to go out that way\\n(indicating the gate of the stable yard). Tell Nicola to bring\\nhis bag here after him. Don't forget.\\n\\nLOUKA (surprised). His bag?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Yes, here, as soon as possible. (Vehemently.) Be\\nquick! (Louka runs into the house. Catherine snatches her apron\\noff and throws it behind a bush. She then takes up the salver\\nand uses it as a mirror, with the result that the handkerchief\\ntied round her head follows the apron. A touch to her hair and a\\nshake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.) Oh,\\nhow--how--how can a man be such a fool! Such a moment to select!\\n(Louka appears at the door of the house, announcing \\\"Captain\\nBluntschli;\\\" and standing aside at the top of the steps to let\\nhim pass before she goes in again. He is the man of the\\nadventure in Raina's room. He is now clean, well brushed,\\nsmartly uniformed, and out of trouble, but still unmistakably\\nthe same man. The moment Louka's back is turned, Catherine\\nswoops on him with hurried, urgent, coaxing appeal.) Captain\\nBluntschli, I am very glad to see you; but you must leave this\\nhouse at once. (He raises his eyebrows.) My husband has just\\nreturned, with my future son-in-law; and they know nothing. If\\nthey did, the consequences would be terrible. You are a\\nforeigner: you do not feel our national animosities as we do. We\\nstill hate the Servians: the only effect of the peace on my\\nhusband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey. If\\nhe discovered our secret, he would never forgive me; and my\\ndaughter's life would hardly be safe. Will you, like the\\nchivalrous gentleman and soldier you are, leave at once before\\nhe finds you here?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (disappointed, but philosophical). At once, gracious\\nlady. I only came to thank you and return the coat you lent me.\\nIf you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with\\nyour servant as I pass out, I need detain you no further. (He\\nturns to go into the house.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (catching him by the sleeve). Oh, you must not think\\nof going back that way. (Coaxing him across to the stable\\ngates.) This is the shortest way out. Many thanks. So glad to\\nhave been of service to you. Good-bye.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. But my bag?\\n\\nCATHERINE. It will be sent on. You will leave me your address.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. True. Allow me. (He takes out his card-case, and\\nstops to write his address, keeping Catherine in an agony of\\nimpatience. As he hands her the card, Petkoff, hatless, rushes\\nfrom the house in a fluster of hospitality, followed by\\nSergius.)\\n\\nPETKOFF (as he hurries down the steps). My dear Captain\\nBluntschli--\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh Heavens! (She sinks on the seat against the wall.)\\n\\nPETKOFF (too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes\\nBluntschli's hand heartily). Those stupid people of mine thought\\nI was out here, instead of in the--haw!--library. (He cannot\\nmention the library without betraying how proud he is of it.) I\\nsaw you through the window. I was wondering why you didn't come\\nin. Saranoff is with me: you remember him, don't you?\\n\\nSERGIUS (saluting humorously, and then offering his hand with\\ngreat charm of manner). Welcome, our friend the enemy!\\n\\nPETKOFF. No longer the enemy, happily. (Rather anxiously.) I\\nhope you've come as a friend, and not on business.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, quite as a friend, Paul. I was just asking\\nCaptain Bluntschli to stay to lunch; but he declares he must go\\nat once.\\n\\nSERGIUS (sardonically). Impossible, Bluntschli. We want you\\nhere badly. We have to send on three cavalry regiments to\\nPhillipopolis; and we don't in the least know how to do it.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (suddenly attentive and business-like).\\nPhillipopolis! The forage is the trouble, eh?\\n\\nPETKOFF (eagerly). Yes, that's it. (To Sergius.) He sees the\\nwhole thing at once.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I think I can shew you how to manage that.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Invaluable man! Come along! (Towering over Bluntschli,\\nhe puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps,\\nPetkoff following. As Bluntschli puts his foot on the first\\nstep, Raina comes out of the house.)\\n\\nRAINA (completely losing her presence of mind). Oh, the\\nchocolate cream soldier!\\n\\n    (Bluntschli stands rigid. Sergius, amazed, looks\\n     at Raina, then at Petkoff, who looks back at him\\n     and then at his wife.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (with commanding presence of mind). My dear Raina,\\ndon't you see that we have a guest here--Captain Bluntschli, one\\nof our new Servian friends?\\n\\n    (Raina bows; Bluntschli bows.)\\n\\nRAINA. How silly of me! (She comes down into the centre of the\\ngroup, between Bluntschli and Petkoff) I made a beautiful\\nornament this morning for the ice pudding; and that stupid\\nNicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it.\\n(To Bluntschli, winningly.) I hope you didn't think that you\\nwere the chocolate cream soldier, Captain Bluntschli.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (laughing). I assure you I did. (Stealing a\\nwhimsical glance at her.) Your explanation was a relief.\\n\\nPETKOFF (suspiciously, to Raina). And since when, pray, have\\nyou taken to cooking?\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, whilst you were away. It is her latest fancy.\\n\\nPETKOFF (testily). And has Nicola taken to drinking? He used to\\nbe careful enough. First he shews Captain Bluntschli out here\\nwhen he knew quite well I was in the--hum!--library; and then\\nhe goes downstairs and breaks Raina's chocolate soldier. He\\nmust--(At this moment Nicola appears at the top of the steps R.,\\nwith a carpet bag. He descends; places it respectfully before\\nBluntschli; and waits for further orders. General amazement.\\nNicola, unconscious of the effect he is producing, looks\\nperfectly satisfied with himself. When Petkoff recovers his\\npower of speech, he breaks out at him with) Are you mad, Nicola?\\n\\nNICOLA (taken aback). Sir?\\n\\nPETKOFF. What have you brought that for?\\n\\nNICOLA. My lady's orders, sir. Louka told me that--\\n\\nCATHERINE (interrupting him). My orders! Why should I order you\\nto bring Captain Bluntschli's luggage out here? What are you\\nthinking of, Nicola?\\n\\nNICOLA (after a moment's bewilderment, picking up the bag as he\\naddresses Bluntschli with the very perfection of servile\\ndiscretion). I beg your pardon, sir, I am sure. (To Catherine.)\\nMy fault, madam! I hope you'll overlook it! (He bows, and is\\ngoing to the steps with the bag, when Petkoff addresses him\\nangrily.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. You'd better go and slam that bag, too, down on Miss\\nRaina's ice pudding! (This is too much for Nicola. The bag drops\\nfrom his hands on Petkoff's corns, eliciting a roar of anguish\\nfrom him.) Begone, you butter-fingered donkey.\\n\\nNICOLA (snatching up the bag, and escaping into the house).\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Oh, never mind, Paul, don't be angry!\\n\\nPETKOFF (muttering). Scoundrel. He's got out of hand while I\\nwas away. I'll teach him. (Recollecting his guest.) Oh, well,\\nnever mind. Come, Bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about\\nyou having to go away. You know very well you're not going back\\nto Switzerland yet. Until you do go back you'll stay with us.\\n\\nRAINA. Oh, do, Captain Bluntschli.\\n\\nPETKOFF (to Catherine). Now, Catherine, it's of you that he's\\nafraid. Press him and he'll stay.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Of course I shall be only too delighted if\\n(appealingly) Captain Bluntschli really wishes to stay. He knows\\nmy wishes.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (in his driest military manner). I am at madame's\\norders.\\n\\nSERGIUS (cordially). That settles it!\\n\\nPETKOFF (heartily). Of course!\\n\\nRAINA. You see, you must stay!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (smiling). Well, If I must, I must!\\n(Gesture of despair from Catherine.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\n\\n    In the library after lunch. It is not much of a\\n    library, its literary equipment consisting of a\\n    single fixed shelf stocked with old paper-covered\\n    novels, broken backed, coffee stained, torn and\\n    thumbed, and a couple of little hanging shelves\\n    with a few gift books on them, the rest of the\\n    wall space being occupied by trophies of war and\\n    the chase. But it is a most comfortable\\n    sitting-room. A row of three large windows in the\\n    front of the house shew a mountain panorama, which\\n    is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in\\n    the mellowing afternoon light. In the left hand\\n    corner, a square earthenware stove, a perfect\\n    tower of colored pottery, rises nearly to the\\n    ceiling and guarantees plenty of warmth. The\\n    ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of\\n    decorated cushions, and the window seats are well\\n    upholstered divans. Little Turkish tables, one of\\n    them with an elaborate hookah on it, and a screen\\n    to match them, complete the handsome effect of the\\n    furnishing. There is one object, however, which is\\n    hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings.\\n    This is a small kitchen table, much the worse for\\n    wear, fitted as a writing table with an old\\n    canister full of pens, an eggcup filled with ink,\\n    and a deplorable scrap of severely used pink\\n    blotting paper.\\n\\n    At the side of this table, which stands on the\\n    right, Bluntschli is hard at work, with a couple\\n    of maps before him, writing orders. At the head of\\n    it sits Sergius, who is also supposed to be at\\n    work, but who is actually gnawing the feather of a\\n    pen, and contemplating Bluntschli's quick, sure,\\n    businesslike progress with a mixture of envious\\n    irritation at his own incapacity, and awestruck\\n    wonder at an ability which seems to him almost\\n    miraculous, though its prosaic character forbids\\n    him to esteem it. The major is comfortably\\n    established on the ottoman, with a newspaper in\\n    his hand and the tube of the hookah within his\\n    reach. Catherine sits at the stove, with her back\\n    to them, embroidering. Raina, reclining on the\\n    divan under the left hand window, is gazing in a\\n    daydream out at the Balkan landscape, with a\\n    neglected novel in her lap.\\n\\n    The door is on the left. The button of the\\n    electric bell is between the door and the\\n    fireplace.\\n\\nPETKOFF (looking up from his paper to watch how they are\\ngetting on at the table). Are you sure I can't help you in any\\nway, Bluntschli?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (without interrupting his writing or looking up).\\nQuite sure, thank you. Saranoff and I will manage it.\\n\\nSERGIUS (grimly). Yes: we'll manage it. He finds out what to\\ndo; draws up the orders; and I sign 'em. Division of labour,\\nMajor. (Bluntschli passes him a paper.) Another one? Thank you.\\n(He plants the papers squarely before him; sets his chair\\ncarefully parallel to them; and signs with the air of a man\\nresolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat.) This hand\\nis more accustomed to the sword than to the pen.\\n\\nPETKOFF. It's very good of you, Bluntschli, it is indeed, to let\\nyourself be put upon in this way. Now are you quite sure I can\\ndo nothing?\\n\\nCATHERINE (in a low, warning tone). You can stop interrupting,\\nPaul.\\n\\nPETKOFF (starting and looking round at her). Eh? Oh! Quite\\nright, my love, quite right. (He takes his newspaper up, but\\nlets it drop again.) Ah, you haven't been campaigning,\\nCatherine: you don't know how pleasant it is for us to sit here,\\nafter a good lunch, with nothing to do but enjoy ourselves.\\nThere's only one thing I want to make me thoroughly comfortable.\\n\\nCATHERINE. What is that?\\n\\nPETKOFF. My old coat. I'm not at home in this one: I feel as if\\nI were on parade.\\n\\nCATHERINE. My dear Paul, how absurd you are about that old coat!\\nIt must be hanging in the blue closet where you left it.\\n\\nPETKOFF. My dear Catherine, I tell you I've looked there. Am I\\nto believe my own eyes or not? (Catherine quietly rises and\\npresses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace.) What\\nare you shewing off that bell for? (She looks at him majestically,\\nand silently resumes her chair and her needlework.) My dear: if\\nyou think the obstinacy of your sex can make a coat out of two\\nold dressing gowns of Raina's, your waterproof, and my\\nmackintosh, you're mistaken. That's exactly what the blue closet\\ncontains at present. (Nicola presents himself.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (unmoved by Petkoff's sally). Nicola: go to the blue\\ncloset and bring your master's old coat here--the braided one he\\nusually wears in the house.\\n\\nNICOLA. Yes, madam. (Nicola goes out.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. Catherine.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Yes, Paul?\\n\\nPETKOFF. I bet you any piece of jewellery you like to order from\\nSofia against a week's housekeeping money, that the coat isn't\\nthere.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Done, Paul.\\n\\nPETKOFF (excited by the prospect of a gamble). Come: here's an\\nopportunity for some sport. Who'll bet on it? Bluntschli: I'll\\ngive you six to one.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (imperturbably). It would be robbing you, Major.\\nMadame is sure to be right. (Without looking up, he passes\\nanother batch of papers to Sergius.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (also excited). Bravo, Switzerland! Major: I bet my\\nbest charger against an Arab mare for Raina that Nicola finds\\nthe coat in the blue closet.\\n\\nPETKOFF (eagerly). Your best char--\\n\\nCATHERINE (hastily interrupting him). Don't be foolish, Paul.\\nAn Arabian mare will cost you 50,000 levas.\\n\\nRAINA (suddenly coming out of her picturesque revery). Really,\\nmother, if you are going to take the jewellery, I don't see why\\nyou should grudge me my Arab.\\n\\n   (Nicola comes back with the coat and brings it\\n    to Petkoff, who can hardly believe his eyes.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. Where was it, Nicola?\\n\\nNICOLA. Hanging in the blue closet, madam.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Well, I am d--\\n\\nCATHERINE (stopping him). Paul!\\n\\nPETKOFF. I could have sworn it wasn't there. Age is beginning to\\ntell on me. I'm getting hallucinations. (To Nicola.) Here: help\\nme to change. Excuse me, Bluntschli. (He begins changing coats,\\nNicola acting as valet.) Remember: I didn't take that bet of\\nyours, Sergius. You'd better give Raina that Arab steed\\nyourself, since you've roused her expectations. Eh, Raina? (He\\nlooks round at her; but she is again rapt in the landscape. With\\na little gush of paternal affection and pride, he points her out\\nto them and says) She's dreaming, as usual.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Assuredly she shall not be the loser.\\n\\nPETKOFF. So much the better for her. I shan't come off so cheap,\\nI expect. (The change is now complete. Nicola goes out with the\\ndiscarded coat.) Ah, now I feel at home at last. (He sits down\\nand takes his newspaper with a grunt of relief.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (to Sergius, handing a paper). That's the last\\norder.\\n\\nPETKOFF (jumping up). What! finished?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Finished. (Petkoff goes beside Sergius; looks\\ncuriously over his left shoulder as he signs; and says with\\nchildlike envy) Haven't you anything for me to sign?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Not necessary. His signature will do.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Ah, well, I think we've done a thundering good day's\\nwork. (He goes away from the table.) Can I do anything more?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. You had better both see the fellows that are to take\\nthese. (To Sergius.) Pack them off at once; and shew them that\\nI've marked on the orders the time they should hand them in by.\\nTell them that if they stop to drink or tell stories--if they're\\nfive minutes late, they'll have the skin taken off their backs.\\n\\nSERGIUS (rising indignantly). I'll say so. And if one of them\\nis man enough to spit in my face for insulting him, I'll buy his\\ndischarge and give him a pension. (He strides out, his humanity\\ndeeply outraged.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (confidentially). Just see that he talks to them\\nproperly, Major, will you?\\n\\nPETKOFF (officiously). Quite right, Bluntschli, quite right.\\nI'll see to it. (He goes to the door importantly, but hesitates\\non the threshold.) By the bye, Catherine, you may as well come,\\ntoo. They'll be far more frightened of you than of me.\\n\\nCATHERINE (putting down her embroidery). I daresay I had\\nbetter. You will only splutter at them. (She goes out, Petkoff\\nholding the door for her and following her.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. What a country! They make cannons out of cherry\\ntrees; and the officers send for their wives to keep discipline!\\n(He begins to fold and docket the papers. Raina, who has risen\\nfrom the divan, strolls down the room with her hands clasped\\nbehind her, and looks mischievously at him.)\\n\\nRAINA. You look ever so much nicer than when we last met. (He\\nlooks up, surprised.) What have you done to yourself?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Washed; brushed; good night's sleep and breakfast.\\nThat's all.\\n\\nRAINA. Did you get back safely that morning?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Quite, thanks.\\n\\nRAINA. Were they angry with you for running away from Sergius's\\ncharge?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. No, they were glad; because they'd all just run away\\nthemselves.\\n\\nRAINA (going to the table, and leaning over it towards him). It\\nmust have made a lovely story for them--all that about me and my\\nroom.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Capital story. But I only told it to one of them--a\\nparticular friend.\\n\\nRAINA. On whose discretion you could absolutely rely?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Absolutely.\\n\\nRAINA. Hm! He told it all to my father and Sergius the day you\\nexchanged the prisoners. (She turns away and strolls carelessly\\nacross to the other side of the room.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (deeply concerned and half incredulous). No! you\\ndon't mean that, do you?\\n\\nRAINA (turning, with sudden earnestness). I do indeed. But they\\ndon't know that it was in this house that you hid. If Sergius\\nknew, he would challenge you and kill you in a duel.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Bless me! then don't tell him.\\n\\nRAINA (full of reproach for his levity). Can you realize what\\nit is to me to deceive him? I want to be quite perfect with\\nSergius--no meanness, no smallness, no deceit. My relation to\\nhim is the one really beautiful and noble part of my life. I\\nhope you can understand that.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (sceptically). You mean that you wouldn't like him\\nto find out that the story about the ice pudding was\\na--a--a--You know.\\n\\nRAINA (wincing). Ah, don't talk of it in that flippant way. I\\nlied: I know it. But I did it to save your life. He would have\\nkilled you. That was the second time I ever uttered a falsehood.\\n(Bluntschli rises quickly and looks doubtfully and somewhat\\nseverely at her.) Do you remember the first time?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I! No. Was I present?\\n\\nRAINA. Yes; and I told the officer who was searching for you\\nthat you were not present.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. True. I should have remembered it.\\n\\nRAINA (greatly encouraged). Ah, it is natural that you should\\nforget it first. It cost you nothing: it cost me a lie!--a lie!!\\n(She sits down on the ottoman, looking straight before her with\\nher hands clasped on her knee. Bluntschli, quite touched, goes\\nto the ottoman with a particularly reassuring and considerate\\nair, and sits down beside her.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. My dear young lady, don't let this worry you.\\nRemember: I'm a soldier. Now what are the two things that happen\\nto a soldier so often that he comes to think nothing of them?\\nOne is hearing people tell lies (Raina recoils): the other is\\ngetting his life saved in all sorts of ways by all sorts of\\npeople.\\n\\nRAINA (rising in indignant protest). And so he becomes a\\ncreature incapable of faith and of gratitude.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (making a wry face). Do you like gratitude? I don't.\\nIf pity is akin to love, gratitude is akin to the other thing.\\n\\nRAINA. Gratitude! (Turning on him.) If you are incapable of\\ngratitude you are incapable of any noble sentiment. Even animals\\nare grateful. Oh, I see now exactly what you think of me! You\\nwere not surprised to hear me lie. To you it was something I\\nprobably did every day--every hour. That is how men think of\\nwomen. (She walks up the room melodramatically.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (dubiously). There's reason in everything. You said\\nyou'd told only two lies in your whole life. Dear young lady:\\nisn't that rather a short allowance? I'm quite a straightforward\\nman myself; but it wouldn't last me a whole morning.\\n\\nRAINA (staring haughtily at him). Do you know, sir, that you\\nare insulting me?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I can't help it. When you get into that noble\\nattitude and speak in that thrilling voice, I admire you; but I\\nfind it impossible to believe a single word you say.\\n\\nRAINA (superbly). Captain Bluntschli!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (unmoved). Yes?\\n\\nRAINA (coming a little towards him, as if she could not believe\\nher senses). Do you mean what you said just now? Do you know\\nwhat you said just now?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I do.\\n\\nRAINA (gasping). I! I!!! (She points to herself incredulously,\\nmeaning \\\"I, Raina Petkoff, tell lies!\\\" He meets her gaze\\nunflinchingly. She suddenly sits down beside him, and adds, with\\na complete change of manner from the heroic to the familiar) How\\ndid you find me out?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (promptly). Instinct, dear young lady. Instinct, and\\nexperience of the world.\\n\\nRAINA (wonderingly). Do you know, you are the first man I ever\\nmet who did not take me seriously?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. You mean, don't you, that I am the first man that\\nhas ever taken you quite seriously?\\n\\nRAINA. Yes, I suppose I do mean that. (Cosily, quite at her ease\\nwith him.) How strange it is to be talked to in such a way! You\\nknow, I've always gone on like that--I mean the noble attitude\\nand the thrilling voice. I did it when I was a tiny child to my\\nnurse. She believed in it. I do it before my parents. They\\nbelieve in it. I do it before Sergius. He believes in it.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Yes: he's a little in that line himself, isn't he?\\n\\nRAINA (startled). Do you think so?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. You know him better than I do.\\n\\nRAINA. I wonder--I wonder is he? If I thought that--!\\n(Discouraged.) Ah, well, what does it matter? I suppose, now\\nthat you've found me out, you despise me.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (warmly, rising). No, my dear young lady, no, no, no\\na thousand times. It's part of your youth--part of your charm.\\nI'm like all the rest of them--the nurse--your\\nparents--Sergius: I'm your infatuated admirer.\\n\\nRAINA (pleased). Really?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (slapping his breast smartly with his hand, German\\nfashion). Hand aufs Herz! Really and truly.\\n\\nRAINA (very happy). But what did you think of me for giving you\\nmy portrait?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (astonished). Your portrait! You never gave me your\\nportrait.\\n\\nRAINA (quickly). Do you mean to say you never got it?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. No. (He sits down beside her, with renewed interest,\\nand says, with some complacency.) When did you send it to me?\\n\\nRAINA (indignantly). I did not send it to you. (She turns her\\nhead away, and adds, reluctantly.) It was in the pocket of that\\ncoat.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (pursing his lips and rounding his eyes). Oh-o-oh! I\\nnever found it. It must be there still.\\n\\nRAINA (springing up). There still!--for my father to find the\\nfirst time he puts his hand in his pocket! Oh, how could you be\\nso stupid?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (rising also). It doesn't matter: it's only a\\nphotograph: how can he tell who it was intended for? Tell him he\\nput it there himself.\\n\\nRAINA (impatiently). Yes, that is so clever--so clever! What\\nshall I do?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Ah, I see. You wrote something on it. That was rash!\\n\\nRAINA (annoyed almost to tears). Oh, to have done such a thing\\nfor you, who care no more--except to laugh at me--oh! Are you\\nsure nobody has touched it?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Well, I can't be quite sure. You see I couldn't\\ncarry it about with me all the time: one can't take much luggage\\non active service.\\n\\nRAINA. What did you do with it?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. When I got through to Peerot I had to put it in safe\\nkeeping somehow. I thought of the railway cloak room; but that's\\nthe surest place to get looted in modern warfare. So I pawned\\nit.\\n\\nRAINA. Pawned it!!!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I know it doesn't sound nice; but it was much the\\nsafest plan. I redeemed it the day before yesterday. Heaven only\\nknows whether the pawnbroker cleared out the pockets or not.\\n\\nRAINA (furious--throwing the words right into his face). You\\nhave a low, shopkeeping mind. You think of things that would\\nnever come into a gentleman's head.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (phlegmatically). That's the Swiss national\\ncharacter, dear lady.\\n\\nRAINA. Oh, I wish I had never met you. (She flounces away and\\nsits at the window fuming.)\\n\\n   (Louka comes in with a heap of letters and\\n    telegrams on her salver, and crosses, with her\\n    bold, free gait, to the table. Her left sleeve is\\n    looped up to the shoulder with a brooch, shewing\\n    her naked arm, with a broad gilt bracelet covering\\n    the bruise.)\\n\\nLOUKA (to Bluntschli). For you. (She empties the salver\\nrecklessly on the table.) The messenger is waiting. (She is\\ndetermined not to be civil to a Servian, even if she must bring\\nhim his letters.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (to Raina). Will you excuse me: the last postal\\ndelivery that reached me was three weeks ago. These are the\\nsubsequent accumulations. Four telegrams--a week old. (He opens\\none.) Oho! Bad news!\\n\\nRAINA (rising and advancing a little remorsefully). Bad news?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. My father's dead. (He looks at the telegram with his\\nlips pursed, musing on the unexpected change in his\\narrangements.)\\n\\nRAINA. Oh, how very sad!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Yes: I shall have to start for home in an hour. He\\nhas left a lot of big hotels behind him to be looked after.\\n(Takes up a heavy letter in a long blue envelope.) Here's a\\nwhacking letter from the family solicitor. (He pulls out the\\nenclosures and glances over them.) Great Heavens! Seventy! Two\\nhundred! (In a crescendo of dismay.) Four hundred! Four\\nthousand!! Nine thousand six hundred!!! What on earth shall I do\\nwith them all?\\n\\nRAINA (timidly). Nine thousand hotels?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Hotels! Nonsense. If you only knew!--oh, it's too\\nridiculous! Excuse me: I must give my fellow orders about\\nstarting. (He leaves the room hastily, with the documents in his\\nhand.)\\n\\nLOUKA (tauntingly). He has not much heart, that Swiss, though\\nhe is so fond of the Servians. He has not a word of grief for\\nhis poor father.\\n\\nRAINA (bitterly). Grief!--a man who has been doing nothing but\\nkilling people for years! What does he care? What does any\\nsoldier care? (She goes to the door, evidently restraining her\\ntears with difficulty.)\\n\\nLOUKA. Major Saranoff has been fighting, too; and he has plenty\\nof heart left. (Raina, at the door, looks haughtily at her and\\ngoes out.) Aha! I thought you wouldn't get much feeling out of\\nyour soldier. (She is following Raina when Nicola enters with an\\narmful of logs for the fire.)\\n\\nNICOLA (grinning amorously at her). I've been trying all the\\nafternoon to get a minute alone with you, my girl. (His\\ncountenance changes as he notices her arm.) Why, what fashion is\\nthat of wearing your sleeve, child?\\n\\nLOUKA (proudly). My own fashion.\\n\\nNICOLA. Indeed! If the mistress catches you, she'll talk to you.\\n(He throws the logs down on the ottoman, and sits comfortably\\nbeside them.)\\n\\nLOUKA. Is that any reason why you should take it on yourself to\\ntalk to me?\\n\\nNICOLA. Come: don't be so contrary with me. I've some good news\\nfor you. (He takes out some paper money. Louka, with an eager\\ngleam in her eyes, comes close to look at it.) See, a twenty\\nleva bill! Sergius gave me that out of pure swagger. A fool and\\nhis money are soon parted. There's ten levas more. The Swiss\\ngave me that for backing up the mistress's and Raina's lies\\nabout him. He's no fool, he isn't. You should have heard old\\nCatherine downstairs as polite as you please to me, telling me\\nnot to mind the Major being a little impatient; for they knew\\nwhat a good servant I was--after making a fool and a liar of me\\nbefore them all! The twenty will go to our savings; and you\\nshall have the ten to spend if you'll only talk to me so as to\\nremind me I'm a human being. I get tired of being a servant\\noccasionally.\\n\\nLOUKA (scornfully). Yes: sell your manhood for thirty levas,\\nand buy me for ten! Keep your money. You were born to be a\\nservant. I was not. When you set up your shop you will only be\\neverybody's servant instead of somebody's servant.\\n\\nNICOLA (picking up his logs, and going to the stove). Ah, wait\\ntill you see. We shall have our evenings to ourselves; and I\\nshall be master in my own house, I promise you. (He throws the\\nlogs down and kneels at the stove.)\\n\\nLOUKA. You shall never be master in mine. (She sits down on\\nSergius's chair.)\\n\\nNICOLA (turning, still on his knees, and squatting down rather\\nforlornly, on his calves, daunted by her implacable disdain).\\nYou have a great ambition in you, Louka. Remember: if any luck\\ncomes to you, it was I that made a woman of you.\\n\\nLOUKA. You!\\n\\nNICOLA (with dogged self-assertion). Yes, me. Who was it made\\nyou give up wearing a couple of pounds of false black hair on\\nyour head and reddening your lips and cheeks like any other\\nBulgarian girl? I did. Who taught you to trim your nails, and\\nkeep your hands clean, and be dainty about yourself, like a fine\\nRussian lady? Me! do you hear that? me! (She tosses her head\\ndefiantly; and he rises, ill-humoredly, adding more coolly) I've\\noften thought that if Raina were out of the way, and you just a\\nlittle less of a fool and Sergius just a little more of one, you\\nmight come to be one of my grandest customers, instead of only\\nbeing my wife and costing me money.\\n\\nLOUKA. I believe you would rather be my servant than my husband.\\nYou would make more out of me. Oh, I know that soul of yours.\\n\\nNICOLA (going up close to her for greater emphasis). Never you\\nmind my soul; but just listen to my advice. If you want to be a\\nlady, your present behaviour to me won't do at all, unless when\\nwe're alone. It's too sharp and impudent; and impudence is a\\nsort of familiarity: it shews affection for me. And don't you\\ntry being high and mighty with me either. You're like all\\ncountry girls: you think it's genteel to treat a servant the way\\nI treat a stable-boy. That's only your ignorance; and don't you\\nforget it. And don't be so ready to defy everybody. Act as if\\nyou expected to have your own way, not as if you expected to be\\nordered about. The way to get on as a lady is the same as the\\nway to get on as a servant: you've got to know your place;\\nthat's the secret of it. And you may depend on me to know my\\nplace if you get promoted. Think over it, my girl. I'll stand by\\nyou: one servant should always stand by another.\\n\\nLOUKA (rising impatiently). Oh, I must behave in my own way.\\nYou take all the courage out of me with your cold-blooded\\nwisdom. Go and put those logs on the fire: that's the sort of\\nthing you understand. (Before Nicola can retort, Sergius comes\\nin. He checks himself a moment on seeing Louka; then goes to the\\nstove.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (to Nicola). I am not in the way of your work, I hope.\\n\\nNICOLA (in a smooth, elderly manner). Oh, no, sir, thank you\\nkindly. I was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit\\nof running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance, to\\nlook at the books. That's the worst of her education, sir: it\\ngives her habits above her station. (To Louka.) Make that table\\ntidy, Louka, for the Major. (He goes out sedately.)\\n\\n    (Louka, without looking at Sergius, begins to\\n     arrange the papers on the table. He crosses slowly\\n     to her, and studies the arrangement of her sleeve\\n     reflectively.)\\n\\nSERGIUS. Let me see: is there a mark there? (He turns up the\\nbracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp. She stands\\nmotionless, not looking at him: fascinated, but on her guard.)\\nFfff! Does it hurt?\\n\\nLOUKA. Yes.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Shall I cure it?\\n\\nLOUKA (instantly withdrawing herself proudly, but still not\\nlooking at him). No. You cannot cure it now.\\n\\nSERGIUS (masterfully). Quite sure? (He makes a movement as if\\nto take her in his arms.)\\n\\nLOUKA. Don't trifle with me, please. An officer should not\\ntrifle with a servant.\\n\\nSERGIUS (touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his\\nforefinger). That was no trifle, Louka.\\n\\nLOUKA. No. (Looking at him for the first time.) Are you sorry?\\n\\nSERGIUS (with measured emphasis, folding his arms). I am never\\nsorry.\\n\\nLOUKA (wistfully). I wish I could believe a man could be so\\nunlike a woman as that. I wonder are you really a brave man?\\n\\nSERGIUS (unaffectedly, relaxing his attitude). Yes: I am a\\nbrave man. My heart jumped like a woman's at the first shot; but\\nin the charge I found that I was brave. Yes: that at least is\\nreal about me.\\n\\nLOUKA. Did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are\\npoor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich\\nlike you?\\n\\nSERGIUS (with bitter levity.) Not a bit. They all slashed and\\ncursed and yelled like heroes. Psha! the courage to rage and\\nkill is cheap. I have an English bull terrier who has as much of\\nthat sort of courage as the whole Bulgarian nation, and the\\nwhole Russian nation at its back. But he lets my groom thrash\\nhim, all the same. That's your soldier all over! No, Louka, your\\npoor men can cut throats; but they are afraid of their officers;\\nthey put up with insults and blows; they stand by and see one\\nanother punished like children---aye, and help to do it when\\nthey are ordered. And the officers!---well (with a short, bitter\\nlaugh) I am an officer. Oh, (fervently) give me the man who will\\ndefy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets\\nitself up against his own will and conscience: he alone is the\\nbrave man.\\n\\nLOUKA. How easy it is to talk! Men never seem to me to grow up:\\nthey all have schoolboy's ideas. You don't know what true\\ncourage is.\\n\\nSERGIUS (ironically). Indeed! I am willing to be instructed.\\n\\nLOUKA. Look at me! how much am I allowed to have my own will? I\\nhave to get your room ready for you--to sweep and dust, to fetch\\nand carry. How could that degrade me if it did not degrade you\\nto have it done for you? But (with subdued passion) if I were\\nEmpress of Russia, above everyone in the world, then--ah, then,\\nthough according to you I could shew no courage at all; you\\nshould see, you should see.\\n\\nSERGIUS. What would you do, most noble Empress?\\n\\nLOUKA. I would marry the man I loved, which no other queen in\\nEurope has the courage to do. If I loved you, though you would\\nbe as far beneath me as I am beneath you, I would dare to be the\\nequal of my inferior. Would you dare as much if you loved me?\\nNo: if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let\\nit grow. You dare not: you would marry a rich man's daughter\\nbecause you would be afraid of what other people would say of\\nyou.\\n\\nSERGIUS (carried away). You lie: it is not so, by all the\\nstars! If I loved you, and I were the Czar himself, I would set\\nyou on the throne by my side. You know that I love another\\nwoman, a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth. And\\nyou are jealous of her.\\n\\nLOUKA. I have no reason to be. She will never marry you now. The\\nman I told you of has come back. She will marry the Swiss.\\n\\nSERGIUS (recoiling). The Swiss!\\n\\nLOUKA. A man worth ten of you. Then you can come to me; and I\\nwill refuse you. You are not good enough for me. (She turns to\\nthe door.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (springing after her and catching her fiercely in his\\narms). I will kill the Swiss; and afterwards I will do as I\\nplease with you.\\n\\nLOUKA (in his arms, passive and steadfast). The Swiss will kill\\nyou, perhaps. He has beaten you in love. He may beat you in war.\\n\\nSERGIUS (tormentedly). Do you think I believe that she--she!\\nwhose worst thoughts are higher than your best ones, is capable\\nof trifling with another man behind my back?\\n\\nLOUKA. Do you think she would believe the Swiss if he told her\\nnow that I am in your arms?\\n\\nSERGIUS (releasing her in despair). Damnation! Oh, damnation!\\nMockery, mockery everywhere: everything I think is mocked by\\neverything I do. (He strikes himself frantically on the breast.)\\nCoward, liar, fool! Shall I kill myself like a man, or live and\\npretend to laugh at myself? (She again turns to go.) Louka! (She\\nstops near the door.) Remember: you belong to me.\\n\\nLOUKA (quietly). What does that mean--an insult?\\n\\nSERGIUS (commandingly). It means that you love me, and that I\\nhave had you here in my arms, and will perhaps have you there\\nagain. Whether that is an insult I neither know nor care: take\\nit as you please. But (vehemently) I will not be a coward and a\\ntrifler. If I choose to love you, I dare marry you, in spite of\\nall Bulgaria. If these hands ever touch you again, they shall\\ntouch my affianced bride.\\n\\nLOUKA. We shall see whether you dare keep your word. But take\\ncare. I will not wait long.\\n\\nSERGIUS (again folding his arms and standing motionless in the\\nmiddle of the room). Yes, we shall see. And you shall wait my\\npleasure.\\n\\n   (Bluntschli, much preoccupied, with his papers\\n    still in his hand, enters, leaving the door open\\n    for Louka to go out. He goes across to the table,\\n    glancing at her as he passes. Sergius, without\\n    altering his resolute attitude, watches him\\n    steadily. Louka goes out, leaving the door open.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (absently, sitting at the table as before, and\\nputting down his papers). That's a remarkable looking young\\nwoman.\\n\\nSERGIUS (gravely, without moving). Captain Bluntschli.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Eh?\\n\\nSERGIUS. You have deceived me. You are my rival. I brook no\\nrivals. At six o'clock I shall be in the drilling-ground on the\\nKlissoura road, alone, on horseback, with my sabre. Do you\\nunderstand?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (staring, but sitting quite at his ease). Oh, thank\\nyou: that's a cavalry man's proposal. I'm in the artillery; and\\nI have the choice of weapons. If I go, I shall take a machine\\ngun. And there shall be no mistake about the cartridges this\\ntime.\\n\\nSERGIUS (flushing, but with deadly coldness). Take care, sir.\\nIt is not our custom in Bulgaria to allow invitations of that\\nkind to be trifled with.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (warmly). Pooh! don't talk to me about Bulgaria. You\\ndon't know what fighting is. But have it your own way. Bring\\nyour sabre along. I'll meet you.\\n\\nSERGIUS (fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of\\nspirit). Well said, Switzer. Shall I lend you my best horse?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. No: damn your horse!---thank you all the same, my\\ndear fellow. (Raina comes in, and hears the next sentence.) I\\nshall fight you on foot. Horseback's too dangerous: I don't want\\nto kill you if I can help it.\\n\\nRAINA (hurrying forward anxiously). I have heard what Captain\\nBluntschli said, Sergius. You are going to fight. Why? (Sergius\\nturns away in silence, and goes to the stove, where he stands\\nwatching her as she continues, to Bluntschli) What about?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I don't know: he hasn't told me. Better not\\ninterfere, dear young lady. No harm will be done: I've often\\nacted as sword instructor. He won't be able to touch me; and\\nI'll not hurt him. It will save explanations. In the morning I\\nshall be off home; and you'll never see me or hear of me again.\\nYou and he will then make it up and live happily ever after.\\n\\nRAINA (turning away deeply hurt, almost with a sob in her\\nvoice). I never said I wanted to see you again.\\n\\nSERGIUS (striding forward). Ha! That is a confession.\\n\\nRAINA (haughtily). What do you mean?\\n\\nSERGIUS. You love that man!\\n\\nRAINA (scandalized). Sergius!\\n\\nSERGIUS. You allow him to make love to you behind my back, just\\nas you accept me as your affianced husband behind his.\\nBluntschli: you knew our relations; and you deceived me. It is\\nfor that that I call you to account, not for having received\\nfavours that I never enjoyed.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (jumping up indignantly). Stuff! Rubbish! I have\\nreceived no favours. Why, the young lady doesn't even know\\nwhether I'm married or not.\\n\\nRAINA (forgetting herself). Oh! (Collapsing on the ottoman.)\\nAre you?\\n\\nSERGIUS. You see the young lady's concern, Captain Bluntschli.\\nDenial is useless. You have enjoyed the privilege of being\\nreceived in her own room, late at night--\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (interrupting him pepperily). Yes; you blockhead!\\nShe received me with a pistol at her head. Your cavalry were at\\nmy heels. I'd have blown out her brains if she'd uttered a cry.\\n\\nSERGIUS (taken aback). Bluntschli! Raina: is this true?\\n\\nRAINA (rising in wrathful majesty). Oh, how dare you, how dare\\nyou?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Apologize, man, apologize! (He resumes his seat at\\nthe table.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (with the old measured emphasis, folding his arms). I\\nnever apologize.\\n\\nRAINA (passionately). This is the doing of that friend of\\nyours, Captain Bluntschli. It is he who is spreading this\\nhorrible story about me. (She walks about excitedly.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. No: he's dead--burnt alive.\\n\\nRAINA (stopping, shocked). Burnt alive!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Shot in the hip in a wood yard. Couldn't drag\\nhimself out. Your fellows' shells set the timber on fire and\\nburnt him, with half a dozen other poor devils in the same\\npredicament.\\n\\nRAINA. How horrible!\\n\\nSERGIUS. And how ridiculous! Oh, war! war! the dream of patriots\\nand heroes! A fraud, Bluntschli, a hollow sham, like love.\\n\\nRAINA (outraged). Like love! You say that before me.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Come, Saranoff: that matter is explained.\\n\\nSERGIUS. A hollow sham, I say. Would you have come back here if\\nnothing had passed between you, except at the muzzle of your\\npistol? Raina is mistaken about our friend who was burnt. He was\\nnot my informant.\\n\\nRAINA. Who then? (Suddenly guessing the truth.) Ah, Louka! my\\nmaid, my servant! You were with her this morning all that time\\nafter---after---Oh, what sort of god is this I have been\\nworshipping! (He meets her gaze with sardonic enjoyment of her\\ndisenchantment. Angered all the more, she goes closer to him,\\nand says, in a lower, intenser tone) Do you know that I looked\\nout of the window as I went upstairs, to have another sight of\\nmy hero; and I saw something that I did not understand then. I\\nknow now that you were making love to her.\\n\\nSERGIUS (with grim humor). You saw that?\\n\\nRAINA. Only too well. (She turns away, and throws herself on the\\ndivan under the centre window, quite overcome.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (cynically). Raina: our romance is shattered. Life's a\\nfarce.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (to Raina, goodhumoredly). You see: he's found\\nhimself out now.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Bluntschli: I have allowed you to call me a blockhead.\\nYou may now call me a coward as well. I refuse to fight you. Do\\nyou know why?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. No; but it doesn't matter. I didn't ask the reason\\nwhen you cried on; and I don't ask the reason now that you cry\\noff. I'm a professional soldier. I fight when I have to, and am\\nvery glad to get out of it when I haven't to. You're only an\\namateur: you think fighting's an amusement.\\n\\nSERGIUS. You shall hear the reason all the same, my\\nprofessional. The reason is that it takes two men--real men--men\\nof heart, blood and honor--to make a genuine combat. I could no\\nmore fight with you than I could make love to an ugly woman.\\nYou've no magnetism: you're not a man, you're a machine.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (apologetically). Quite true, quite true. I always\\nwas that sort of chap. I'm very sorry. But now that you've found\\nthat life isn't a farce, but something quite sensible and\\nserious, what further obstacle is there to your happiness?\\n\\nRAINA (riling). You are very solicitous about my happiness and\\nhis. Do you forget his new love--Louka? It is not you that he\\nmust fight now, but his rival, Nicola.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Rival!! (Striking his forehead.)\\n\\nRAINA. Did you not know that they are engaged?\\n\\nSERGIUS. Nicola! Are fresh abysses opening! Nicola!!\\n\\nRAINA (sarcastically). A shocking sacrifice, isn't it? Such\\nbeauty, such intellect, such modesty, wasted on a middle-aged\\nservant man! Really, Sergius, you cannot stand by and allow such\\na thing. It would be unworthy of your chivalry.\\n\\nSERGIUS (losing all self-control). Viper! Viper! (He rushes to\\nand fro, raging.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Look here, Saranoff; you're getting the worst of\\nthis.\\n\\nRAINA (getting angrier). Do you realize what he has done,\\nCaptain Bluntschli? He has set this girl as a spy on us; and her\\nreward is that he makes love to her.\\n\\nSERGIUS. False! Monstrous!\\n\\nRAINA. Monstrous! (Confronting him.) Do you deny that she told\\nyou about Captain Bluntschli being in my room?\\n\\nSERGIUS. No; but--\\n\\nRAINA (interrupting). Do you deny that you were making love to\\nher when she told you?\\n\\nSERGIUS. No; but I tell you--\\n\\nRAINA (cutting him short contemptuously). It is unnecessary to\\ntell us anything more. That is quite enough for us. (She turns\\nher back on him and sweeps majestically back to the window.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (quietly, as Sergius, in an agony of mortification,\\nsinks on the ottoman, clutching his averted head between his\\nfists). I told you you were getting the worst of it, Saranoff.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Tiger cat!\\n\\nRAINA (running excitedly to Bluntschli). You hear this man\\ncalling me names, Captain Bluntschli?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. What else can he do, dear lady? He must defend\\nhimself somehow. Come (very persuasively), don't quarrel. What\\ngood does it do? (Raina, with a gasp, sits down on the ottoman,\\nand after a vain effort to look vexedly at Bluntschli, she falls\\na victim to her sense of humor, and is attacked with a\\ndisposition to laugh.)\\n\\nSERGIUS. Engaged to Nicola! (He rises.) Ha! ha! (Going to the\\nstove and standing with his back to it.) Ah, well, Bluntschli,\\nyou are right to take this huge imposture of a world coolly.\\n\\nRAINA (to Bluntschli with an intuitive guess at his state of\\nmind). I daresay you think us a couple of grown up babies, don't\\nyou?\\n\\nSERGIUS (grinning a little). He does, he does. Swiss\\ncivilization nursetending Bulgarian barbarism, eh?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (blushing). Not at all, I assure you. I'm only very\\nglad to get you two quieted. There now, let's be pleasant and\\ntalk it over in a friendly way. Where is this other young lady?\\n\\nRAINA. Listening at the door, probably.\\n\\nSERGIUS (shivering as if a bullet had struck him, and speaking\\nwith quiet but deep indignation). I will prove that that, at\\nleast, is a calumny. (He goes with dignity to the door and opens\\nit. A yell of fury bursts from him as he looks out. He darts\\ninto the passage, and returns dragging in Louka, whom he flings\\nagainst the table, R., as he cries) Judge her, Bluntschli--you,\\nthe moderate, cautious man: judge the eavesdropper.\\n\\n    (Louka stands her ground, proud and silent.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (shaking his head). I mustn't judge her. I once\\nlistened myself outside a tent when there was a mutiny brewing.\\nIt's all a question of the degree of provocation. My life was at\\nstake.\\n\\nLOUKA. My love was at stake. (Sergius flinches, ashamed of her\\nin spite of himself.) I am not ashamed.\\n\\nRAINA (contemptuously). Your love! Your curiosity, you mean.\\n\\nLOUKA (facing her and retorting her contempt with interest). My\\nlove, stronger than anything you can feel, even for your\\nchocolate cream soldier.\\n\\nSERGIUS (with quick suspicion--to Louka). What does that mean?\\n\\nLOUKA (fiercely). It means--\\n\\nSERGIUS (interrupting her slightingly). Oh, I remember, the ice\\npudding. A paltry taunt, girl.\\n\\n    (Major Petkoff enters, in his shirtsleeves.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. Excuse my shirtsleeves, gentlemen. Raina: somebody has\\nbeen wearing that coat of mine: I'll swear it--somebody with\\nbigger shoulders than mine. It's all burst open at the back.\\nYour mother is mending it. I wish she'd make haste. I shall\\ncatch cold. (He looks more attentively at them.) Is anything the\\nmatter?\\n\\nRAINA. No. (She sits down at the stove with a tranquil air.)\\n\\nSERGIUS. Oh, no! (He sits down at the end of the table, as at\\nfirst.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (who is already seated). Nothing, nothing.\\n\\nPETKOFF (sitting down on the ottoman in his old place). That's\\nall right. (He notices Louka.) Anything the matter, Louka?\\n\\nLOUKA. No, sir.\\n\\nPETKOFF (genially). That's all right. (He sneezes.) Go and ask\\nyour mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (She\\nturns to obey; but Nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a\\npretence of having business in the room by taking the little\\ntable with the hookah away to the wall near the windows.)\\n\\nRAINA (rising quickly, as she sees the coat on Nicola's arm).\\nHere it is, papa. Give it to me, Nicola; and do you put some\\nmore wood on the fire. (She takes the coat, and brings it to the\\nMajor, who stands up to put it on. Nicola attends to the fire.)\\n\\nPETKOFF (to Raina, teasing her affectionately). Aha! Going to\\nbe very good to poor old papa just for one day after his return\\nfrom the wars, eh?\\n\\nRAINA (with solemn reproach). Ah, how can you say that to me,\\nfather?\\n\\nPETKOFF. Well, well, only a joke, little one. Come, give me a\\nkiss. (She kisses him.) Now give me the coat.\\n\\nRAINA. Now, I am going to put it on for you. Turn your back. (He\\nturns his back and feels behind him with his arms for the\\nsleeves. She dexterously takes the photograph from the pocket\\nand throws it on the table before Bluntschli, who covers it with\\na sheet of paper under the very nose of Sergius, who looks on\\namazed, with his suspicions roused in the highest degree. She\\nthen helps Petkoff on with his coat.) There, dear! Now are you\\ncomfortable?\\n\\nPETKOFF. Quite, little love. Thanks. (He sits down; and Raina\\nreturns to her seat near the stove.) Oh, by the bye, I've found\\nsomething funny. What's the meaning of this? (He put his hand\\ninto the picked pocket.) Eh? Hallo! (He tries the other pocket.)\\nWell, I could have sworn--(Much puzzled, he tries the breast\\npocket.) I wonder--(Tries the original pocket.) Where can\\nit--(A light flashes on him; he rises, exclaiming) Your mother's\\ntaken it.\\n\\nRAINA (very red). Taken what?\\n\\nPETKOFF. Your photograph, with the inscription: \\\"Raina, to her\\nChocolate Cream Soldier--a souvenir.\\\" Now you know there's\\nsomething more in this than meets the eye; and I'm going to find\\nit out. (Shouting) Nicola!\\n\\nNICOLA (dropping a log, and turning). Sir!\\n\\nPETKOFF. Did you spoil any pastry of Miss Raina's this morning?\\n\\nNICOLA. You heard Miss Raina say that I did, sir.\\n\\nPETKOFF. I know that, you idiot. Was it true?\\n\\nNICOLA. I am sure Miss Raina is incapable of saying anything\\nthat is not true, sir.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Are you? Then I'm not. (Turning to the others.) Come:\\ndo you think I don't see it all? (Goes to Sergius, and slaps him\\non the shoulder.) Sergius: you're the chocolate cream soldier,\\naren't you?\\n\\nSERGIUS (starting up). I! a chocolate cream soldier! Certainly\\nnot.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Not! (He looks at them. They are all very serious and\\nvery conscious.) Do you mean to tell me that Raina sends\\nphotographic souvenirs to other men?\\n\\nSERGIUS (enigmatically). The world is not such an innocent\\nplace as we used to think, Petkoff.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (rising). It's all right, Major. I'm the chocolate\\ncream soldier. (Petkoff and Sergius are equally astonished.) The\\ngracious young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams\\nwhen I was starving--shall I ever forget their flavour! My late\\nfriend Stolz told you the story at Peerot. I was the fugitive.\\n\\nPETKOFF. You! (He gasps.) Sergius: do you remember how those two\\nwomen went on this morning when we mentioned it? (Sergius smiles\\ncynically. Petkoff confronts Raina severely.) You're a nice young\\nwoman, aren't you?\\n\\nRAINA (bitterly). Major Saranoff has changed his mind. And when\\nI wrote that on the photograph, I did not know that Captain\\nBluntschli was married.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (much startled protesting vehemently). I'm not\\nmarried.\\n\\nRAINA (with deep reproach). You said you were.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I did not. I positively did not. I never was married\\nin my life.\\n\\nPETKOFF (exasperated). Raina: will you kindly inform me, if I\\nam not asking too much, which gentleman you are engaged to?\\n\\nRAINA. To neither of them. This young lady (introducing Louka,\\nwho faces them all proudly) is the object of Major Saranoff's\\naffections at present.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Louka! Are you mad, Sergius? Why, this girl's engaged\\nto Nicola.\\n\\nNICOLA (coming forward ). I beg your pardon, sir. There is a\\nmistake. Louka is not engaged to me.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Not engaged to you, you scoundrel! Why, you had\\ntwenty-five levas from me on the day of your betrothal; and she\\nhad that gilt bracelet from Miss Raina.\\n\\nNICOLA (with cool unction). We gave it out so, sir. But it was\\nonly to give Louka protection. She had a soul above her station;\\nand I have been no more than her confidential servant. I intend,\\nas you know, sir, to set up a shop later on in Sofia; and I look\\nforward to her custom and recommendation should she marry into\\nthe nobility. (He goes out with impressive discretion, leaving\\nthem all staring after him.)\\n\\nPETKOFF (breaking the silence). Well, I am---hm!\\n\\nSERGIUS. This is either the finest heroism or the most crawling\\nbaseness. Which is it, Bluntschli?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Never mind whether it's heroism or baseness.\\nNicola's the ablest man I've met in Bulgaria. I'll make him\\nmanager of a hotel if he can speak French and German.\\n\\nLOUKA (suddenly breaking out at Sergius). I have been insulted\\nby everyone here. You set them the example. You owe me an\\napology. (Sergius immediately, like a repeating clock of which\\nthe spring has been touched, begins to fold his arms.)\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (before he can speak). It's no use. He never\\napologizes.\\n\\nLOUKA. Not to you, his equal and his enemy. To me, his poor\\nservant, he will not refuse to apologize.\\n\\nSERGIUS (approvingly). You are right. (He bends his knee in his\\ngrandest manner.) Forgive me!\\n\\nLOUKA. I forgive you. (She timidly gives him her hand, which he\\nkisses.) That touch makes me your affianced wife.\\n\\nSERGIUS (springing up). Ah, I forgot that!\\n\\nLOUKA (coldly). You can withdraw if you like.\\n\\nSERGIUS. Withdraw! Never! You belong to me! (He puts his arm\\nabout her and draws her to him.) (Catherine comes in and finds\\nLouka in Sergius's arms, and all the rest gazing at them in\\nbewildered astonishment.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. What does this mean? (Sergius releases Louka.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. Well, my dear, it appears that Sergius is going to\\nmarry Louka instead of Raina. (She is about to break out\\nindignantly at him: he stops her by exclaiming testily.) Don't\\nblame me: I've nothing to do with it. (He retreats to the\\nstove.)\\n\\nCATHERINE. Marry Louka! Sergius: you are bound by your word to\\nus!\\n\\nSERGIUS (folding his arms). Nothing binds me.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (much pleased by this piece of common sense).\\nSaranoff: your hand. My congratulations. These heroics of yours\\nhave their practical side after all. (To Louka.) Gracious young\\nlady: the best wishes of a good Republican! (He kisses her hand,\\nto Raina's great disgust.)\\n\\nCATHERINE (threateningly). Louka: you have been telling\\nstories.\\n\\nLOUKA. I have done Raina no harm.\\n\\nCATHERINE (haughtily). Raina! (Raina is equally indignant at\\nthe liberty.)\\n\\nLOUKA. I have a right to call her Raina: she calls me Louka. I\\ntold Major Saranoff she would never marry him if the Swiss\\ngentleman came back.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (surprised). Hallo!\\n\\nLOUKA (turning to Raina). I thought you were fonder of him than\\nof Sergius. You know best whether I was right.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. What nonsense! I assure you, my dear Major, my dear\\nMadame, the gracious young lady simply saved my life, nothing\\nelse. She never cared two straws for me. Why, bless my heart and\\nsoul, look at the young lady and look at me. She, rich, young,\\nbeautiful, with her imagination full of fairy princes and noble\\nnatures and cavalry charges and goodness knows what! And I, a\\ncommon-place Swiss soldier who hardly knows what a decent life\\nis after fifteen years of barracks and battles--a vagabond--a\\nman who has spoiled all his chances in life through an incurably\\nromantic disposition--a man--\\n\\nSERGIUS (starting as if a needle had pricked him and\\ninterrupting Bluntschli in incredulous amazement). Excuse me,\\nBluntschli: what did you say had spoiled your chances in life?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (promptly). An incurably romantic disposition. I ran\\naway from home twice when I was a boy. I went into the army\\ninstead of into my father's business. I climbed the balcony of\\nthis house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest\\ncellar. I came sneaking back here to have another look at the\\nyoung lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat\\nback--\\n\\nPETKOFF. My coat!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI.--Yes: that's the coat I mean--would have sent it\\nback and gone quietly home. Do you suppose I am the sort of\\nfellow a young girl falls in love with? Why, look at our ages!\\nI'm thirty-four: I don't suppose the young lady is much over\\nseventeen. (This estimate produces a marked sensation, all the\\nrest turning and staring at one another. He proceeds\\ninnocently.) All that adventure which was life or death to me,\\nwas only a schoolgirl's game to her--chocolate creams and hide\\nand seek. Here's the proof! (He takes the photograph from the\\ntable.) Now, I ask you, would a woman who took the affair\\nseriously have sent me this and written on it: \\\"Raina, to her\\nchocolate cream soldier--a souvenir\\\"? (He exhibits the\\nphotograph triumphantly, as if it settled the matter beyond all\\npossibility of refutation.)\\n\\nPETKOFF. That's what I was looking for. How the deuce did it get\\nthere?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (to Raina complacently). I have put everything\\nright, I hope, gracious young lady!\\n\\nRAINA (in uncontrollable vexation). I quite agree with your\\naccount of yourself. You are a romantic idiot. (Bluntschli is\\nunspeakably taken aback.) Next time I hope you will know the\\ndifference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of\\ntwenty-three.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (stupefied). Twenty-three! (She snaps the photograph\\ncontemptuously from his hand; tears it across; and throws the\\npieces at his feet.)\\n\\nSERGIUS (with grim enjoyment of Bluntschli's discomfiture).\\nBluntschli: my one last belief is gone. Your sagacity is a\\nfraud, like all the other things. You have less sense than even\\nI have.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (overwhelmed). Twenty-three! Twenty-three!! (He\\nconsiders.) Hm! (Swiftly making up his mind.) In that case,\\nMajor Petkoff, I beg to propose formally to become a suitor for\\nyour daughter's hand, in place of Major Saranoff retired.\\n\\nRAINA. You dare!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. If you were twenty-three when you said those things\\nto me this afternoon, I shall take them seriously.\\n\\nCATHERINE (loftily polite). I doubt, sir, whether you quite\\nrealize either my daughter's position or that of Major Sergius\\nSaranoff, whose place you propose to take. The Petkoffs and the\\nSaranoffs are known as the richest and most important families\\nin the country. Our position is almost historical: we can go\\nback for nearly twenty years.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Oh, never mind that, Catherine. (To Bluntschli.) We\\nshould be most happy, Bluntschli, if it were only a question of\\nyour position; but hang it, you know, Raina is accustomed to a\\nvery comfortable establishment. Sergius keeps twenty horses.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. But what on earth is the use of twenty horses? Why,\\nit's a circus.\\n\\nCATHERINE (severely). My daughter, sir, is accustomed to a\\nfirst-rate stable.\\n\\nRAINA. Hush, mother, you're making me ridiculous.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Oh, well, if it comes to a question of an\\nestablishment, here goes! (He goes impetuously to the table and\\nseizes the papers in the blue envelope.) How many horses did you\\nsay?\\n\\nSERGIUS. Twenty, noble Switzer!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I have two hundred horses. (They are amazed.) How\\nmany carriages?\\n\\nSERGIUS. Three.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I have seventy. Twenty-four of them will hold twelve\\ninside, besides two on the box, without counting the driver and\\nconductor. How many tablecloths have you?\\n\\nSERGIUS. How the deuce do I know?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. Have you four thousand?\\n\\nSERGIUS. NO.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I have. I have nine thousand six hundred pairs of\\nsheets and blankets, with two thousand four hundred eider-down\\nquilts. I have ten thousand knives and forks, and the same\\nquantity of dessert spoons. I have six hundred servants. I have\\nsix palatial establishments, besides two livery stables, a tea\\ngarden and a private house. I have four medals for distinguished\\nservices; I have the rank of an officer and the standing of a\\ngentleman; and I have three native languages. Show me any man in\\nBulgaria that can offer as much.\\n\\nPETKOFF (with childish awe). Are you Emperor of Switzerland?\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. My rank is the highest known in Switzerland: I'm a\\nfree citizen.\\n\\nCATHERINE. Then Captain Bluntschli, since you are my daughter's\\nchoice, I shall not stand in the way of her happiness. (Petkoff\\nis about to speak.) That is Major Petkoff's feeling also.\\n\\nPETKOFF. Oh, I shall be only too glad. Two hundred horses! Whew!\\n\\nSERGIUS. What says the lady?\\n\\nRAINA (pretending to sulk). The lady says that he can keep his\\ntablecloths and his omnibuses. I am not here to be sold to the\\nhighest bidder.\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. I won't take that answer. I appealed to you as a\\nfugitive, a beggar, and a starving man. You accepted me. You\\ngave me your hand to kiss, your bed to sleep in, and your roof\\nto shelter me--\\n\\nRAINA (interrupting him). I did not give them to the Emperor of\\nSwitzerland!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI. That's just what I say. (He catches her hand quickly\\nand looks her straight in the face as he adds, with confident\\nmastery) Now tell us who you did give them to.\\n\\nRAINA (succumbing with a shy smile). To my chocolate cream\\nsoldier!\\n\\nBLUNTSCHLI (with a boyish laugh of delight). That'll do. Thank\\nyou. (Looks at his watch and suddenly becomes businesslike.)\\nTime's up, Major. You've managed those regiments so well that\\nyou are sure to be asked to get rid of some of the Infantry of\\nthe Teemok division. Send them home by way of Lom Palanka.\\nSaranoff: don't get married until I come back: I shall be here\\npunctually at five in the evening on Tuesday fortnight. Gracious\\nladies--good evening. (He makes them a military bow, and goes.)\\n\\nSERGIUS. What a man! What a man!\",\n          \"SCENE--A Chamber in an old-fashioned House.\\n\\n\\nEnter MRS. HARDCASTLE and MR. HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I vow, Mr. Hardcastle, you're very particular.  Is\\nthere a creature in the whole country but ourselves, that does not take\\na trip to town now and then, to rub off the rust a little?  There's the\\ntwo Miss Hoggs, and our neighbour Mrs. Grigsby, go to take a month's\\npolishing every winter.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the\\nwhole year.  I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home!  In\\nmy time, the follies of the town crept slowly among us, but now they\\ntravel faster than a stage-coach.  Its fopperies come down not only as\\ninside passengers, but in the very basket.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Ay, your times were fine times indeed; you have been\\ntelling us of them for many a long year.  Here we live in an old\\nrumbling mansion, that looks for all the world like an inn, but that we\\nnever see company.  Our best visitors are old Mrs. Oddfish, the\\ncurate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame dancing-master; and all\\nour entertainment your old stories of Prince Eugene and the Duke of\\nMarlborough.  I hate such old-fashioned trumpery.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And I love it.  I love everything that's old: old\\nfriends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine; and I believe,\\nDorothy (taking her hand), you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old\\nwife.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Lord, Mr. Hardcastle, you're for ever at your\\nDorothys and your old wifes.  You may be a Darby, but I'll be no Joan,\\nI promise you.  I'm not so old as you'd make me, by more than one good\\nyear.  Add twenty to twenty, and make money of that.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Let me see; twenty added to twenty makes just fifty and\\nseven.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  It's false, Mr. Hardcastle; I was but twenty when I\\nwas brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr. Lumpkin, my first\\nhusband; and he's not come to years of discretion yet.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Nor ever will, I dare answer for him.  Ay, you have\\ntaught him finely.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  No matter.  Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune.  My son\\nis not to live by his learning.  I don't think a boy wants much\\nlearning to spend fifteen hundred a year.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Learning, quotha! a mere composition of tricks and\\nmischief.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Humour, my dear; nothing but humour.  Come, Mr.\\nHardcastle, you must allow the boy a little humour.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I'd sooner allow him a horse-pond.  If burning the\\nfootmen's shoes, frightening the maids, and worrying the kittens be\\nhumour, he has it.  It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back\\nof my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs.\\nFrizzle's face.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  And am I to blame?  The poor boy was always too\\nsickly to do any good.  A school would be his death.  When he comes to\\nbe a little stronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for\\nhim?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Latin for him!  A cat and fiddle.  No, no; the alehouse\\nand the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Well, we must not snub the poor boy now, for I\\nbelieve we shan't have him long among us.  Anybody that looks in his\\nface may see he's consumptive.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, if growing too fat be one of the symptoms.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  He coughs sometimes.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I'm actually afraid of his lungs.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And truly so am I; for he sometimes whoops like a\\nspeaking trumpet--(Tony hallooing behind the scenes)--O, there he\\ngoes--a very consumptive figure, truly.\\n\\n\\nEnter TONY, crossing the stage.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Tony, where are you going, my charmer?  Won't you\\ngive papa and I a little of your company, lovee?\\n\\nTONY.  I'm in haste, mother; I cannot stay.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  You shan't venture out this raw evening, my dear; you\\nlook most shockingly.\\n\\nTONY.  I can't stay, I tell you.  The Three Pigeons expects me down\\nevery moment.  There's some fun going forward.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay; the alehouse, the old place: I thought so.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  A low, paltry set of fellows.\\n\\nTONY.  Not so low, neither.  There's Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack\\nSlang the horse doctor, Little Aminadab that grinds the music box, and\\nTom Twist that spins the pewter platter.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Pray, my dear, disappoint them for one night at\\nleast.\\n\\nTONY.  As for disappointing them, I should not so much mind; but I\\ncan't abide to disappoint myself.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (detaining him.)  You shan't go.\\n\\nTONY.  I will, I tell you.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I say you shan't.\\n\\nTONY.  We'll see which is strongest, you or I.  [Exit, hauling her\\nout.]\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (solus.)  Ay, there goes a pair that only spoil each\\nother.  But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and\\ndiscretion out of doors?  There's my pretty darling Kate! the fashions\\nof the times have almost infected her too.  By living a year or two in\\ntown, she is as fond of gauze and French frippery as the best of them.\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Blessings on my pretty innocence! drest out as usual, my\\nKate.  Goodness!  What a quantity of superfluous silk hast thou got\\nabout thee, girl!  I could never teach the fools of this age, that the\\nindigent world could be clothed out of the trimmings of the vain.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  You know our agreement, sir.  You allow me the\\nmorning to receive and pay visits, and to dress in my own manner; and\\nin the evening I put on my housewife's dress to please you.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, remember, I insist on the terms of our agreement;\\nand, by the bye, I believe I shall have occasion to try your obedience\\nthis very evening.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I protest, sir, I don't comprehend your meaning.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Then to be plain with you, Kate, I expect the young\\ngentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day.  I\\nhave his father's letter, in which he informs me his son is set out,\\nand that he intends to follow himself shortly after.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Indeed!  I wish I had known something of this\\nbefore.  Bless me, how shall I behave?  It's a thousand to one I\\nshan't like him; our meeting will be so formal, and so like a thing of\\nbusiness, that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Depend upon it, child, I'll never control your choice; but\\nMr. Marlow, whom I have pitched upon, is the son of my old friend, Sir\\nCharles Marlow, of whom you have heard me talk so often.  The young\\ngentleman has been bred a scholar, and is designed for an employment in\\nthe service of his country.  I am told he's a man of an excellent\\nunderstanding.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Is he?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Very generous.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I believe I shall like him.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Young and brave.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I'm sure I shall like him.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And very handsome.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  My dear papa, say no more, (kissing his hand), he's\\nmine; I'll have him.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And, to crown all, Kate, he's one of the most bashful and\\nreserved young fellows in all the world.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Eh! you have frozen me to death again.  That word\\nRESERVED has undone all the rest of his accomplishments.  A reserved\\nlover, it is said, always makes a suspicious husband.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  On the contrary, modesty seldom resides in a breast that\\nis not enriched with nobler virtues.  It was the very feature in his\\ncharacter that first struck me.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  He must have more striking features to catch me, I\\npromise you.  However, if he be so young, so handsome, and so\\neverything as you mention, I believe he'll do still.  I think I'll have\\nhim.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, Kate, but there is still an obstacle.  It's more than\\nan even wager he may not have you.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  My dear papa, why will you mortify one so?--Well, if\\nhe refuses, instead of breaking my heart at his indifference, I'll only\\nbreak my glass for its flattery, set my cap to some newer fashion, and\\nlook out for some less difficult admirer.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Bravely resolved!  In the mean time I'll go prepare the\\nservants for his reception: as we seldom see company, they want as much\\ntraining as a company of recruits the first day's muster.  [Exit.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (Alone).  Lud, this news of papa's puts me all in a\\nflutter.  Young, handsome: these he put last; but I put them foremost.\\nSensible, good-natured; I like all that.  But then reserved and\\nsheepish; that's much against him.  Yet can't he be cured of his\\ntimidity, by being taught to be proud of his wife?  Yes, and can't\\nI--But I vow I'm disposing of the husband before I have secured the\\nlover.\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I'm glad you're come, Neville, my dear.  Tell me,\\nConstance, how do I look this evening?  Is there anything whimsical\\nabout me?  Is it one of my well-looking days, child?  Am I in face\\nto-day?\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Perfectly, my dear.  Yet now I look again--bless\\nme!--sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold\\nfishes.  Has your brother or the cat been meddling? or has the last\\nnovel been too moving?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  No; nothing of all this.  I have been threatened--I\\ncan scarce get it out--I have been threatened with a lover.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  And his name--\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Is Marlow.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Indeed!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  The son of Sir Charles Marlow.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  As I live, the most intimate friend of Mr. Hastings, my\\nadmirer.  They are never asunder.  I believe you must have seen him\\nwhen we lived in town.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Never.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  He's a very singular character, I assure you.  Among\\nwomen of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive; but his\\nacquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of\\nanother stamp: you understand me.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  An odd character indeed.  I shall never be able to\\nmanage him.  What shall I do?  Pshaw, think no more of him, but trust\\nto occurrences for success.  But how goes on your own affair, my dear?\\nhas my mother been courting you for my brother Tony as usual?\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I have just come from one of our agreeable\\ntete-a-tetes.  She has been saying a hundred tender things, and setting\\noff her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And her partiality is such, that she actually thinks\\nhim so.  A fortune like yours is no small temptation.  Besides, as she\\nhas the sole management of it, I'm not surprised to see her unwilling\\nto let it go out of the family.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  A fortune like mine, which chiefly consists in jewels,\\nis no such mighty temptation.  But at any rate, if my dear Hastings be\\nbut constant, I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last.  However,\\nI let her suppose that I am in love with her son; and she never once\\ndreams that my affections are fixed upon another.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  My good brother holds out stoutly.  I could almost\\nlove him for hating you so.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  It is a good-natured creature at bottom, and I'm sure\\nwould wish to see me married to anybody but himself.  But my aunt's\\nbell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements.  Allons!\\nCourage is necessary, as our affairs are critical.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  \\\"Would it were bed-time, and all were well.\\\"\\n[Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nSCENE--An Alehouse Room.  Several shabby Fellows with punch and\\ntobacco.  TONY at the head of the table, a little higher than the\\nrest, a mallet in his hand.\\n\\n\\nOMNES.  Hurrea! hurrea! hurrea! bravo!\\n\\nFIRST FELLOW  Now, gentlemen, silence for a song.  The 'squire is\\ngoing to knock himself down for a song.\\n\\nOMNES.  Ay, a song, a song!\\n\\nTONY.  Then I'll sing you, gentlemen, a song I made upon this\\nalehouse, the Three Pigeons.\\n\\n\\nSONG.\\n\\n     Let schoolmasters puzzle their brain\\n          With grammar, and nonsense, and learning,\\n     Good liquor, I stoutly maintain,\\n          Gives GENUS a better discerning.\\n     Let them brag of their heathenish gods,\\n          Their Lethes, their Styxes, and Stygians,\\n     Their Quis, and their Quaes, and their Quods,\\n          They're all but a parcel of Pigeons.\\n               Toroddle, toroddle, toroll.\\n\\n     When methodist preachers come down,\\n          A-preaching that drinking is sinful,\\n     I'll wager the rascals a crown,\\n          They always preach best with a skinful.\\n     But when you come down with your pence,\\n          For a slice of their scurvy religion,\\n     I'll leave it to all men of sense,\\n          But you, my good friend, are the Pigeon.\\n               Toroddle, toroddle, toroll.\\n\\n     Then come, put the jorum about,\\n          And let us be merry and clever,\\n     Our hearts and our liquors are stout,\\n          Here's the Three Jolly Pigeons for ever.\\n     Let some cry up woodcock or hare,\\n          Your bustards, your ducks, and your widgeons;\\n     But of all the GAY birds in the air,\\n          Here's a health to the Three Jolly Pigeons.\\n               Toroddle, toroddle, toroll.\\n\\n\\nOMNES.  Bravo, bravo!\\n\\nFIRST FELLOW.  The 'squire has got spunk in him.\\n\\nSECOND FELLOW.  I loves to hear him sing, bekeays he never gives us\\nnothing that's low.\\n\\nTHIRD FELLOW.  O damn anything that's low, I cannot bear it.\\n\\nFOURTH FELLOW.  The genteel thing is the genteel thing any time: if so\\nbe that a gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly.\\n\\nTHIRD FELLOW.  I likes the maxum of it, Master Muggins.  What, though I\\nam obligated to dance a bear, a man may be a gentleman for all that.\\nMay this be my poison, if my bear ever dances but to the very\\ngenteelest of tunes; \\\"Water Parted,\\\" or \\\"The minuet in Ariadne.\\\"\\n\\nSECOND FELLOW.  What a pity it is the 'squire is not come to his own.\\nIt would be well for all the publicans within ten miles round of him.\\n\\nTONY.  Ecod, and so it would, Master Slang.  I'd then show what it was\\nto keep choice of company.\\n\\nSECOND FELLOW.  O he takes after his own father for that.  To be sure\\nold 'Squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman I ever set my eyes on.\\nFor winding the straight horn, or beating a thicket for a hare, or a\\nwench, he never had his fellow.  It was a saying in the place, that he\\nkept the best horses, dogs, and girls, in the whole county.\\n\\nTONY.  Ecod, and when I'm of age, I'll be no bastard, I promise you.  I\\nhave been thinking of Bet Bouncer and the miller's grey mare to begin\\nwith.  But come, my boys, drink about and be merry, for you pay no\\nreckoning.  Well, Stingo, what's the matter?\\n\\n\\nEnter Landlord.\\n\\n\\nLANDLORD.  There be two gentlemen in a post-chaise at the door.  They\\nhave lost their way upo' the forest; and they are talking something\\nabout Mr. Hardcastle.\\n\\nTONY.  As sure as can be, one of them must be the gentleman that's\\ncoming down to court my sister.  Do they seem to be Londoners?\\n\\nLANDLORD.  I believe they may.  They look woundily like Frenchmen.\\n\\nTONY.  Then desire them to step this way, and I'll set them right in a\\ntwinkling. (Exit Landlord.)  Gentlemen, as they mayn't be good enough\\ncompany for you, step down for a moment, and I'll be with you in the\\nsqueezing of a lemon.  [Exeunt mob.]\\n\\nTONY.  (solus).  Father-in-law has been calling me whelp and hound this\\nhalf year.  Now, if I pleased, I could be so revenged upon the old\\ngrumbletonian.  But then I'm afraid--afraid of what?  I shall soon be\\nworth fifteen hundred a year, and let him frighten me out of THAT if he\\ncan.\\n\\n\\nEnter Landlord, conducting MARLOW and HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  What a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of it!  We were\\ntold it was but forty miles across the country, and we have come above\\nthreescore.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  And all, Marlow, from that unaccountable reserve of yours,\\nthat would not let us inquire more frequently on the way.\\n\\nMARLOW.  I own, Hastings, I am unwilling to lay myself under an\\nobligation to every one I meet, and often stand the chance of an\\nunmannerly answer.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  At present, however, we are not likely to receive any\\nanswer.\\n\\nTONY.  No offence, gentlemen.  But I'm told you have been inquiring for\\none Mr. Hardcastle in these parts.  Do you know what part of the\\ncountry you are in?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Not in the least, sir, but should thank you for\\ninformation.\\n\\nTONY.  Nor the way you came?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  No, sir: but if you can inform us----\\n\\nTONY.  Why, gentlemen, if you know neither the road you are going, nor\\nwhere you are, nor the road you came, the first thing I have to inform\\nyou is, that--you have lost your way.\\n\\nMARLOW.  We wanted no ghost to tell us that.\\n\\nTONY.  Pray, gentlemen, may I be so bold so as to ask the place from\\nwhence you came?\\n\\nMARLOW.  That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go.\\n\\nTONY.  No offence; but question for question is all fair, you know.\\nPray, gentlemen, is not this same Hardcastle a cross-grained,\\nold-fashioned, whimsical fellow, with an ugly face, a daughter, and a\\npretty son?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  We have not seen the gentleman; but he has the family you\\nmention.\\n\\nTONY.  The daughter, a tall, trapesing, trolloping, talkative maypole;\\nthe son, a pretty, well-bred, agreeable youth, that everybody is fond\\nof.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Our information differs in this.  The daughter is said to be\\nwell-bred and beautiful; the son an awkward booby, reared up and\\nspoiled at his mother's apron-string.\\n\\nTONY.  He-he-hem!--Then, gentlemen, all I have to tell you is, that you\\nwon't reach Mr. Hardcastle's house this night, I believe.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Unfortunate!\\n\\nTONY.  It's a damn'd long, dark, boggy, dirty, dangerous way.  Stingo,\\ntell the gentlemen the way to Mr. Hardcastle's!  (Winking upon the\\nLandlord.)  Mr. Hardcastle's, of Quagmire Marsh, you understand me.\\n\\nLANDLORD.  Master Hardcastle's!  Lock-a-daisy, my masters, you're come\\na deadly deal wrong!  When you came to the bottom of the hill, you\\nshould have crossed down Squash Lane.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Cross down Squash Lane!\\n\\nLANDLORD.  Then you were to keep straight forward, till you came to\\nfour roads.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Come to where four roads meet?\\n\\nTONY.  Ay; but you must be sure to take only one of them.\\n\\nMARLOW.  O, sir, you're facetious.\\n\\nTONY.  Then keeping to the right, you are to go sideways till you come\\nupon Crackskull Common: there you must look sharp for the track of the\\nwheel, and go forward till you come to farmer Murrain's barn.  Coming\\nto the farmer's barn, you are to turn to the right, and then to the\\nleft, and then to the right about again, till you find out the old\\nmill--\\n\\nMARLOW.  Zounds, man! we could as soon find out the longitude!\\n\\nHASTINGS.  What's to be done, Marlow?\\n\\nMARLOW.  This house promises but a poor reception; though perhaps the\\nlandlord can accommodate us.\\n\\nLANDLORD.  Alack, master, we have but one spare bed in the whole\\nhouse.\\n\\nTONY.  And to my knowledge, that's taken up by three lodgers already.\\n(After a pause, in which the rest seem disconcerted.)  I have hit it.\\nDon't you think, Stingo, our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen\\nby the fire-side, with----three chairs and a bolster?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I hate sleeping by the fire-side.\\n\\nMARLOW.  And I detest your three chairs and a bolster.\\n\\nTONY.  You do, do you? then, let me see--what if you go on a mile\\nfurther, to the Buck's Head; the old Buck's Head on the hill, one of\\nthe best inns in the whole county?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  O ho! so we have escaped an adventure for this night,\\nhowever.\\n\\nLANDLORD.  (apart to TONY).  Sure, you ben't sending them to your\\nfather's as an inn, be you?\\n\\nTONY.  Mum, you fool you.  Let THEM find that out.  (To them.)  You\\nhave only to keep on straight forward, till you come to a large old\\nhouse by the road side.  You'll see a pair of large horns over the\\ndoor.  That's the sign.  Drive up the yard, and call stoutly about you.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Sir, we are obliged to you.  The servants can't miss the\\nway?\\n\\nTONY.  No, no: but I tell you, though, the landlord is rich, and going\\nto leave off business; so he wants to be thought a gentleman, saving\\nyour presence, he! he! he!  He'll be for giving you his company; and,\\necod, if you mind him, he'll persuade you that his mother was an\\nalderman, and his aunt a justice of peace.\\n\\nLANDLORD.  A troublesome old blade, to be sure; but a keeps as good\\nwines and beds as any in the whole country.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Well, if he supplies us with these, we shall want no farther\\nconnexion.  We are to turn to the right, did you say?\\n\\nTONY.  No, no; straight forward.  I'll just step myself, and show you a\\npiece of the way.  (To the Landlord.)  Mum!\\n\\nLANDLORD.  Ah, bless your heart, for a sweet, pleasant--damn'd\\nmischievous son of a whore.  [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE--An old-fashioned House.\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE, followed by three or four awkward Servants.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, I hope you are perfect in the table exercise I have\\nbeen teaching you these three days.  You all know your posts and your\\nplaces, and can show that you have been used to good company, without\\never stirring from home.\\n\\nOMNES.  Ay, ay.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  When company comes you are not to pop out and stare, and\\nthen run in again, like frightened rabbits in a warren.\\n\\nOMNES.  No, no.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  You, Diggory, whom I have taken from the barn, are to make\\na show at the side-table; and you, Roger, whom I have advanced from the\\nplough, are to place yourself behind my chair.  But you're not to stand\\nso, with your hands in your pockets.  Take your hands from your\\npockets, Roger; and from your head, you blockhead you.  See how Diggory\\ncarries his hands.  They're a little too stiff, indeed, but that's no\\ngreat matter.\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Ay, mind how I hold them.  I learned to hold my hands this\\nway when I was upon drill for the militia.  And so being upon drill----\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  You must not be so talkative, Diggory.  You must be all\\nattention to the guests.  You must hear us talk, and not think of\\ntalking; you must see us drink, and not think of drinking; you must see\\nus eat, and not think of eating.\\n\\nDIGGORY.  By the laws, your worship, that's parfectly unpossible.\\nWhenever Diggory sees yeating going forward, ecod, he's always wishing\\nfor a mouthful himself.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Blockhead!  Is not a belly-full in the kitchen as good as\\na belly-full in the parlour?  Stay your stomach with that reflection.\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Ecod, I thank your worship, I'll make a shift to stay my\\nstomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Diggory, you are too talkative.--Then, if I happen to say\\na good thing, or tell a good story at table, you must not all burst out\\na-laughing, as if you made part of the company.\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of Ould\\nGrouse in the gun-room: I can't help laughing at that--he! he!\\nhe!--for the soul of me.  We have laughed at that these twenty\\nyears--ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ha! ha! ha!  The story is a good one.  Well, honest\\nDiggory, you may laugh at that--but still remember to be attentive.\\nSuppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine, how will\\nyou behave?  A glass of wine, sir, if you please (to DIGGORY).--Eh, why\\ndon't you move?\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Ecod, your worship, I never have courage till I see the\\neatables and drinkables brought upo' the table, and then I'm as bauld\\nas a lion.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  What, will nobody move?\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT.  I'm not to leave this pleace.\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT.  I'm sure it's no pleace of mine.\\n\\nTHIRD SERVANT.  Nor mine, for sartain.\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Wauns, and I'm sure it canna be mine.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  You numskulls! and so while, like your betters, you are\\nquarrelling for places, the guests must be starved.  O you dunces!  I\\nfind I must begin all over again----But don't I hear a coach drive into\\nthe yard?  To your posts, you blockheads.  I'll go in the mean time and\\ngive my old friend's son a hearty reception at the gate.  [Exit\\nHARDCASTLE.]\\n\\nDIGGORY.  By the elevens, my pleace is gone quite out of my head.\\n\\nROGER.  I know that my pleace is to be everywhere.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT.  Where the devil is mine?\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT.  My pleace is to be nowhere at all; and so I'ze go\\nabout my business.  [Exeunt Servants, running about as if frightened,\\ndifferent ways.]\\n\\n\\nEnter Servant with candles, showing in MARLOW and HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nSERVANT.  Welcome, gentlemen, very welcome!  This way.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  After the disappointments of the day, welcome once more,\\nCharles, to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire.  Upon my\\nword, a very well-looking house; antique but creditable.\\n\\nMARLOW.  The usual fate of a large mansion.  Having first ruined the\\nmaster by good housekeeping, it at last comes to levy contributions as\\nan inn.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  As you say, we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these\\nfineries.  I have often seen a good sideboard, or a marble\\nchimney-piece, though not actually put in the bill, inflame a\\nreckoning confoundedly.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Travellers, George, must pay in all places: the only\\ndifference is, that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries; in bad\\ninns you are fleeced and starved.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  You have lived very much among them.  In truth, I have been\\noften surprised, that you who have seen so much of the world, with your\\nnatural good sense, and your many opportunities, could never yet\\nacquire a requisite share of assurance.\\n\\nMARLOW.  The Englishman's malady.  But tell me, George, where could I\\nhave learned that assurance you talk of?  My life has been chiefly\\nspent in a college or an inn, in seclusion from that lovely part of the\\ncreation that chiefly teach men confidence.  I don't know that I was\\never familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman--except my\\nmother--But among females of another class, you know----\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Ay, among them you are impudent enough of all conscience.\\n\\nMARLOW.  They are of US, you know.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such\\nan idiot, such a trembler; you look for all the world as if you wanted\\nan opportunity of stealing out of the room.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Why, man, that's because I do want to steal out of the room.\\nFaith, I have often formed a resolution to break the ice, and rattle\\naway at any rate.  But I don't know how, a single glance from a pair of\\nfine eyes has totally overset my resolution.  An impudent fellow may\\ncounterfeit modesty; but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever\\ncounterfeit impudence.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  If you could but say half the fine things to them that I\\nhave heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn, or even a college\\nbed-maker----\\n\\nMARLOW.  Why, George, I can't say fine things to them; they freeze,\\nthey petrify me.  They may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain, or\\nsome such bagatelle; but, to me, a modest woman, drest out in all her\\nfinery, is the most tremendous object of the whole creation.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Ha! ha! ha!  At this rate, man, how can you ever expect to\\nmarry?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Never; unless, as among kings and princes, my bride were to be\\ncourted by proxy.  If, indeed, like an Eastern bridegroom, one were to\\nbe introduced to a wife he never saw before, it might be endured.  But\\nto go through all the terrors of a formal courtship, together with the\\nepisode of aunts, grandmothers, and cousins, and at last to blurt out\\nthe broad staring question of, Madam, will you marry me?  No, no,\\nthat's a strain much above me, I assure you.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I pity you.  But how do you intend behaving to the lady you\\nare come down to visit at the request of your father?\\n\\nMARLOW.  As I behave to all other ladies.  Bow very low, answer yes or\\nno to all her demands--But for the rest, I don't think I shall venture\\nto look in her face till I see my father's again.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I'm surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so\\ncool a lover.\\n\\nMARLOW.  To be explicit, my dear Hastings, my chief inducement down was\\nto be instrumental in forwarding your happiness, not my own.  Miss\\nNeville loves you, the family don't know you; as my friend you are sure\\nof a reception, and let honour do the rest.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My dear Marlow!  But I'll suppress the emotion.  Were I a\\nwretch, meanly seeking to carry off a fortune, you should be the last\\nman in the world I would apply to for assistance.  But Miss Neville's\\nperson is all I ask, and that is mine, both from her deceased father's\\nconsent, and her own inclination.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Happy man!  You have talents and art to captivate any woman.\\nI'm doom'd to adore the sex, and yet to converse with the only part of\\nit I despise.  This stammer in my address, and this awkward\\nprepossessing visage of mine, can never permit me to soar above the\\nreach of a milliner's 'prentice, or one of the duchesses of Drury-lane.\\nPshaw! this fellow here to interrupt us.\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Gentlemen, once more you are heartily welcome.  Which is\\nMr. Marlow?  Sir, you are heartily welcome.  It's not my way, you see,\\nto receive my friends with my back to the fire.  I like give them a\\nhearty reception in the old style at my gate.  I like to see their\\nhorses and trunks taken care of.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  He has got our names from the servants already.  (To\\nhim.)  We approve your caution and hospitality, sir.  (To HASTINGS.)  I\\nhave been thinking, George, of changing our travelling dresses in the\\nmorning.  I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I beg, Mr. Marlow, you'll use no ceremony in this house.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I fancy, Charles, you're right: the first blow is half the\\nbattle.  I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Mr. Marlow--Mr. Hastings--gentlemen--pray be under no\\nconstraint in this house.  This is Liberty-hall, gentlemen.  You may do\\njust as you please here.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yet, George, if we open the campaign too fiercely at first, we\\nmay want ammunition before it is over.  I think to reserve the\\nembroidery to secure a retreat.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Your talking of a retreat, Mr. Marlow, puts me in mind of\\nthe Duke of Marlborough, when we went to besiege Denain.  He first\\nsummoned the garrison----\\n\\nMARLOW.  Don't you think the ventre d'or waistcoat will do with the\\nplain brown?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  He first summoned the garrison, which might consist of\\nabout five thousand men----\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I think not: brown and yellow mix but very poorly.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I say, gentlemen, as I was telling you, be summoned the\\ngarrison, which might consist of about five thousand men----\\n\\nMARLOW.  The girls like finery.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Which might consist of about five thousand men, well\\nappointed with stores, ammunition, and other implements of war.  Now,\\nsays the Duke of Marlborough to George Brooks, that stood next to\\nhim--you must have heard of George Brooks--I'll pawn my dukedom, says\\nhe, but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood.  So----\\n\\nMARLOW.  What, my good friend, if you gave us a glass of punch in the\\nmean time; it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Punch, sir!  (Aside.)  This is the most unaccountable kind\\nof modesty I ever met with.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, sir, punch.  A glass of warm punch, after our journey,\\nwill be comfortable.  This is Liberty-hall, you know.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Here's a cup, sir.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  So this fellow, in his Liberty-hall, will only let\\nus have just what he pleases.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (Taking the cup.)  I hope you'll find it to your mind.  I\\nhave prepared it with my own hands, and I believe you'll own the\\ningredients are tolerable.  Will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?\\nHere, Mr. Marlow, here is to our better acquaintance.  [Drinks.]\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  A very impudent fellow this! but he's a character,\\nand I'll humour him a little.  Sir, my service to you.  [Drinks.]\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Aside.)  I see this fellow wants to give us his company,\\nand forgets that he's an innkeeper, before he has learned to be a\\ngentleman.\\n\\nMARLOW.  From the excellence of your cup, my old friend, I suppose you\\nhave a good deal of business in this part of the country.  Warm work,\\nnow and then, at elections, I suppose.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  No, sir, I have long given that work over.  Since our\\nbetters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other, there is no\\nbusiness \\\"for us that sell ale.\\\"\\n\\nHASTINGS.  So, then, you have no turn for politics, I find.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Not in the least.  There was a time, indeed, I fretted\\nmyself about the mistakes of government, like other people; but finding\\nmyself every day grow more angry, and the government growing no better,\\nI left it to mend itself.  Since that, I no more trouble my head about\\nHyder Ally, or Ally Cawn, than about Ally Croker.  Sir, my service to\\nyou.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  So that with eating above stairs, and drinking below, with\\nreceiving your friends within, and amusing them without, you lead a\\ngood pleasant bustling life of it.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I do stir about a great deal, that's certain.  Half the\\ndifferences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (After drinking.)  And you have an argument in your cup, old\\ngentleman, better than any in Westminster-hall.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, young gentleman, that, and a little philosophy.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  Well, this is the first time I ever heard of an\\ninnkeeper's philosophy.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  So then, like an experienced general, you attack them on\\nevery quarter.  If you find their reason manageable, you attack it with\\nyour philosophy; if you find they have no reason, you attack them with\\nthis.  Here's your health, my philosopher.  [Drinks.]\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Good, very good, thank you; ha! ha!  Your generalship puts\\nme in mind of Prince Eugene, when he fought the Turks at the battle of\\nBelgrade.  You shall hear.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Instead of the battle of Belgrade, I believe it's almost time\\nto talk about supper.  What has your philosophy got in the house for\\nsupper?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  For supper, sir!  (Aside.)  Was ever such a request to a\\nman in his own house?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, sir, supper, sir; I begin to feel an appetite.  I shall\\nmake devilish work to-night in the larder, I promise you.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld.\\n(To him.)  Why, really, sir, as for supper I can't well tell.  My\\nDorothy and the cook-maid settle these things between them.  I leave\\nthese kind of things entirely to them.\\n\\nMARLOW.  You do, do you?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Entirely.  By the bye, I believe they are in actual\\nconsultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Then I beg they'll admit me as one of their privy council.\\nIt's a way I have got.  When I travel, I always chose to regulate my\\nown supper.  Let the cook be called.  No offence I hope, sir.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  O no, sir, none in the least; yet I don't know how; our\\nBridget, the cook-maid, is not very communicative upon these\\noccasions.  Should we send for her, she might scold us all out of the\\nhouse.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Let's see your list of the larder then.  I ask it as a\\nfavour.  I always match my appetite to my bill of fare.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (To HARDCASTLE, who looks at them with surprise.)  Sir, he's\\nvery right, and it's my way too.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Sir, you have a right to command here.  Here, Roger,\\nbring us the bill of fare for to-night's supper: I believe it's drawn\\nout--Your manner, Mr. Hastings, puts me in mind of my uncle, Colonel\\nWallop.  It was a saying of his, that no man was sure of his supper\\ntill he had eaten it.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Aside.)  All upon the high rope!  His uncle a colonel! we\\nshall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace.  But let's\\nhear the bill of fare.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Perusing.)  What's here?  For the first course; for the\\nsecond course; for the dessert.  The devil, sir, do you think we have\\nbrought down a whole Joiners' Company, or the corporation of Bedford,\\nto eat up such a supper?  Two or three little things, clean and\\ncomfortable, will do.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But let's hear it.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Reading.)  For the first course, at the top, a pig and prune\\nsauce.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Damn your pig, I say.\\n\\nMARLOW.  And damn your prune sauce, say I.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And yet, gentlemen, to men that are hungry, pig with\\nprune sauce is very good eating.\\n\\nMARLOW.  At the bottom, a calf's tongue and brains.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Let your brains be knocked out, my good sir, I don't like\\nthem.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Or you may clap them on a plate by themselves.  I do.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  Their impudence confounds me.  (To them.)\\nGentlemen, you are my guests, make what alterations you please.  Is\\nthere anything else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Item, a pork pie, a boiled rabbit and sausages, a Florentine,\\na shaking pudding, and a dish of tiff--taff--taffety cream.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Confound your made dishes; I shall be as much at a loss in\\nthis house as at a green and yellow dinner at the French ambassador's\\ntable.  I'm for plain eating.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I'm sorry, gentlemen, that I have nothing you like, but if\\nthere be anything you have a particular fancy to----\\n\\nMARLOW.  Why, really, sir, your bill of fare is so exquisite, that any\\none part of it is full as good as another.  Send us what you please.\\nSo much for supper.  And now to see that our beds are aired, and\\nproperly taken care of.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I entreat you'll leave that to me.  You shall not stir a\\nstep.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Leave that to you!  I protest, sir, you must excuse me, I\\nalways look to these things myself.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I must insist, sir, you'll make yourself easy on that\\nhead.\\n\\nMARLOW.  You see I'm resolved on it.  (Aside.)  A very troublesome\\nfellow this, as I ever met with.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, sir, I'm resolved at least to attend you.  (Aside.)\\nThis may be modern modesty, but I never saw anything look so like\\nold-fashioned impudence.  [Exeunt MARLOW and HARDCASTLE.]\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Alone.)  So I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow\\ntroublesome.  But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant\\nto please him?  Ha! what do I see?  Miss Neville, by all that's happy!\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  My dear Hastings!  To what unexpected good fortune, to\\nwhat accident, am I to ascribe this happy meeting?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Rather let me ask the same question, as I could never have\\nhoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  An inn! sure you mistake: my aunt, my guardian, lives\\nhere.  What could induce you to think this house an inn?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My friend, Mr. Marlow, with whom I came down, and I, have\\nbeen sent here as to an inn, I assure you.  A young fellow, whom we\\naccidentally met at a house hard by, directed us hither.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks,\\nof whom you have heard me talk so often; ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nHASTINGS.  He whom your aunt intends for you? he of whom I have such\\njust apprehensions?\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  You have nothing to fear from him, I assure you.  You'd\\nadore him, if you knew how heartily he despises me.  My aunt knows it\\ntoo, and has undertaken to court me for him, and actually begins to\\nthink she has made a conquest.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Thou dear dissembler!  You must know, my Constance, I have\\njust seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get\\nadmittance into the family.  The horses that carried us down are now\\nfatigued with their journey, but they'll soon be refreshed; and then,\\nif my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings, we shall soon\\nbe landed in France, where even among slaves the laws of marriage are\\nrespected.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I have often told you, that though ready to obey you, I\\nyet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance.  The\\ngreatest part of it was left me by my uncle, the India director, and\\nchiefly consists in jewels.  I have been for some time persuading my\\naunt to let me wear them.  I fancy I'm very near succeeding.  The\\ninstant they are put into my possession, you shall find me ready to\\nmake them and myself yours.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Perish the baubles!  Your person is all I desire.  In the\\nmean time, my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake.  I know\\nthe strange reserve of his temper is such, that if abruptly informed of\\nit, he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for\\nexecution.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  But how shall we keep him in the deception?  Miss\\nHardcastle is just returned from walking; what if we still continue to\\ndeceive him?----This, this way----[They confer.]\\n\\n\\nEnter MARLOW.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  The assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond bearing.\\nMy host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone, and so he\\nclaps not only himself, but his old-fashioned wife, on my back.  They\\ntalk of coming to sup with us too; and then, I suppose, we are to run\\nthe gantlet through all the rest of the family.--What have we got here?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My dear Charles!  Let me congratulate you!--The most\\nfortunate accident!--Who do you think is just alighted?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Cannot guess.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Our mistresses, boy, Miss Hardcastle and Miss Neville.\\nGive me leave to introduce Miss Constance Neville to your\\nacquaintance.  Happening to dine in the neighbourhood, they called on\\ntheir return to take fresh horses here.  Miss Hardcastle has just stept\\ninto the next room, and will be back in an instant.  Wasn't it lucky?\\neh!\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  I have been mortified enough of all conscience, and\\nhere comes something to complete my embarrassment.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Well, but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Oh! yes.  Very fortunate--a most joyful encounter--But our\\ndresses, George, you know are in disorder--What if we should postpone\\nthe happiness till to-morrow?--To-morrow at her own house--It will be\\nevery bit as convenient--and rather more respectful--To-morrow let it\\nbe.  [Offering to go.]\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  By no means, sir.  Your ceremony will displease her.\\nThe disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience.\\nBesides, she knows you are in the house, and will permit you to see\\nher.\\n\\nMARLOW.  O! the devil! how shall I support it?  Hem! hem!  Hastings,\\nyou must not go.  You are to assist me, you know.  I shall be\\nconfoundedly ridiculous.  Yet, hang it!  I'll take courage.  Hem!\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Pshaw, man! it's but the first plunge, and all's over.\\nShe's but a woman, you know.\\n\\nMARLOW.  And, of all women, she that I dread most to encounter.\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS HARDCASTLE, as returned from walking, a bonnet, etc.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Introducing them.)  Miss Hardcastle, Mr. Marlow.  I'm\\nproud of bringing two persons of such merit together, that only want to\\nknow, to esteem each other.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  Now for meeting my modest gentleman with a\\ndemure face, and quite in his own manner.  (After a pause, in which he\\nappears very uneasy and disconcerted.)  I'm glad of your safe arrival,\\nsir.  I'm told you had some accidents by the way.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Only a few, madam.  Yes, we had some.  Yes, madam, a good many\\naccidents, but should be sorry--madam--or rather glad of any\\naccidents--that are so agreeably concluded.  Hem!\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (To him.)  You never spoke better in your whole life.  Keep\\nit up, and I'll insure you the victory.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I'm afraid you flatter, sir.  You that have seen so\\nmuch of the finest company, can find little entertainment in an obscure\\ncorner of the country.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Gathering courage.)  I have lived, indeed, in the world,\\nmadam; but I have kept very little company.  I have been but an\\nobserver upon life, madam, while others were enjoying it.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  But that, I am told, is the way to enjoy it at last.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (To him.)  Cicero never spoke better.  Once more, and you\\nare confirmed in assurance for ever.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (To him.)  Hem!  Stand by me, then, and when I'm down, throw\\nin a word or two, to set me up again.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  An observer, like you, upon life were, I fear,\\ndisagreeably employed, since you must have had much more to censure\\nthan to approve.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Pardon me, madam.  I was always willing to be amused.  The\\nfolly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (To him.)  Bravo, bravo.  Never spoke so well in your whole\\nlife.  Well, Miss Hardcastle, I see that you and Mr. Marlow are going\\nto be very good company.  I believe our being here will but embarrass\\nthe interview.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Not in the least, Mr. Hastings.  We like your company of all\\nthings.  (To him.)  Zounds!  George, sure you won't go? how can you\\nleave us?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Our presence will but spoil conversation, so we'll retire to\\nthe next room.  (To him.)  You don't consider, man, that we are to\\nmanage a little tete-a-tete of our own.  [Exeunt.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (after a pause).  But you have not been wholly an\\nobserver, I presume, sir: the ladies, I should hope, have employed some\\npart of your addresses.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Relapsing into timidity.)  Pardon me, madam, I--I--I--as yet\\nhave studied--only--to--deserve them.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And that, some say, is the very worst way to obtain\\nthem.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Perhaps so, madam.  But I love to converse only with the more\\ngrave and sensible part of the sex.  But I'm afraid I grow tiresome.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Not at all, sir; there is nothing I like so much as\\ngrave conversation myself; I could hear it for ever.  Indeed, I have\\noften been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those\\nlight airy pleasures, where nothing reaches the heart.\\n\\nMARLOW.  It's----a disease----of the mind, madam.  In the variety of\\ntastes there must be some who, wanting a relish----for----um--a--um.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I understand you, sir.  There must be some, who,\\nwanting a relish for refined pleasures, pretend to despise what they\\nare incapable of tasting.\\n\\nMARLOW.  My meaning, madam, but infinitely better expressed.  And I\\ncan't help observing----a----\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  Who could ever suppose this fellow\\nimpudent upon some occasions?  (To him.)  You were going to observe,\\nsir----\\n\\nMARLOW.  I was observing, madam--I protest, madam, I forget what I was\\ngoing to observe.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  I vow and so do I.  (To him.)  You were\\nobserving, sir, that in this age of hypocrisy--something about\\nhypocrisy, sir.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, madam.  In this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon\\nstrict inquiry do not--a--a--a--\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I understand you perfectly, sir.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  Egad! and that's more than I do myself.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few\\nthat do not condemn in public what they practise in private, and think\\nthey pay every debt to virtue when they praise it.\\n\\nMARLOW.  True, madam; those who have most virtue in their mouths, have\\nleast of it in their bosoms.  But I'm sure I tire you, madam.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Not in the least, sir; there's something so\\nagreeable and spirited in your manner, such life and force--pray, sir,\\ngo on.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, madam.  I was saying----that there are some occasions,\\nwhen a total want of courage, madam, destroys all the----and puts\\nus----upon a--a--a--\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I agree with you entirely; a want of courage upon\\nsome occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance, and betrays us when\\nwe most want to excel.  I beg you'll proceed.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, madam.  Morally speaking, madam--But I see Miss Neville\\nexpecting us in the next room.  I would not intrude for the world.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I protest, sir, I never was more agreeably\\nentertained in all my life.  Pray go on.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, madam, I was----But she beckons us to join her.  Madam,\\nshall I do myself the honour to attend you?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Well, then, I'll follow.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  This pretty smooth dialogue has done for me.\\n[Exit.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (Alone.)  Ha! ha! ha!  Was there ever such a sober,\\nsentimental interview?  I'm certain he scarce looked in my face the\\nwhole time.  Yet the fellow, but for his unaccountable bashfulness, is\\npretty well too.  He has good sense, but then so buried in his fears,\\nthat it fatigues one more than ignorance.  If I could teach him a\\nlittle confidence, it would be doing somebody that I know of a piece of\\nservice.  But who is that somebody?--That, faith, is a question I can\\nscarce answer.  [Exit.]\\n\\n\\nEnter TONY and MISS NEVILLE, followed by MRS. HARDCASTLE and HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nTONY.  What do you follow me for, cousin Con?  I wonder you're not\\nashamed to be so very engaging.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I hope, cousin, one may speak to one's own relations,\\nand not be to blame.\\n\\nTONY.  Ay, but I know what sort of a relation you want to make me,\\nthough; but it won't do.  I tell you, cousin Con, it won't do; so I beg\\nyou'll keep your distance, I want no nearer relationship.  [She\\nfollows, coquetting him to the back scene.]\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Well!  I vow, Mr. Hastings, you are very\\nentertaining.  There's nothing in the world I love to talk of so much\\nas London, and the fashions, though I was never there myself.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Never there!  You amaze me!  From your air and manner, I\\nconcluded you had been bred all your life either at Ranelagh, St.\\nJames's, or Tower Wharf.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  O! sir, you're only pleased to say so.  We country\\npersons can have no manner at all.  I'm in love with the town, and that\\nserves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics; but who can\\nhave a manner, that has never seen the Pantheon, the Grotto Gardens,\\nthe Borough, and such places where the nobility chiefly resort?  All I\\ncan do is to enjoy London at second-hand.  I take care to know every\\ntete-a-tete from the Scandalous Magazine, and have all the fashions, as\\nthey come out, in a letter from the two Miss Rickets of Crooked Lane.\\nPray how do you like this head, Mr. Hastings?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Extremely elegant and degagee, upon my word, madam.  Your\\nfriseur is a Frenchman, I suppose?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I protest, I dressed it myself from a print in the\\nLadies' Memorandum-book for the last year.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Indeed!  Such a head in a side-box at the play-house would\\ndraw as many gazers as my Lady Mayoress at a City Ball.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I vow, since inoculation began, there is no such\\nthing to be seen as a plain woman; so one must dress a little\\nparticular, or one may escape in the crowd.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But that can never be your case, madam, in any dress.\\n(Bowing.)\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Yet, what signifies my dressing when I have such a\\npiece of antiquity by my side as Mr. Hardcastle: all I can say will\\nnever argue down a single button from his clothes.  I have often wanted\\nhim to throw off his great flaxen wig, and where he was bald, to\\nplaster it over, like my Lord Pately, with powder.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  You are right, madam; for, as among the ladies there are\\nnone ugly, so among the men there are none old.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  But what do you think his answer was?  Why, with his\\nusual Gothic vivacity, he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig,\\nto convert it into a tete for my own wearing.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Intolerable!  At your age you may wear what you please, and\\nit must become you.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Pray, Mr. Hastings, what do you take to be the most\\nfashionable age about town?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Some time ago, forty was all the mode; but I'm told the\\nladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Seriously.  Then I shall be too young for the\\nfashion.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  No lady begins now to put on jewels till she's past forty.\\nFor instance, Miss there, in a polite circle, would be considered as a\\nchild, as a mere maker of samplers.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  And yet Mrs. Niece thinks herself as much a woman,\\nand is as fond of jewels, as the oldest of us all.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Your niece, is she?  And that young gentleman, a brother of\\nyours, I should presume?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  My son, sir.  They are contracted to each other.\\nObserve their little sports.  They fall in and out ten times a day, as\\nif they were man and wife already.  (To them.)  Well, Tony, child, what\\nsoft things are you saying to your cousin Constance this evening?\\n\\nTONY.  I have been saying no soft things; but that it's very hard to be\\nfollowed about so.  Ecod! I've not a place in the house now that's left\\nto myself, but the stable.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Never mind him, Con, my dear.  He's in another story\\nbehind your back.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  There's something generous in my cousin's manner.  He\\nfalls out before faces to be forgiven in private.\\n\\nTONY.  That's a damned confounded--crack.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Ah! he's a sly one.  Don't you think they are like\\neach other about the mouth, Mr. Hastings?  The Blenkinsop mouth to a T.\\nThey're of a size too.  Back to back, my pretties, that Mr. Hastings\\nmay see you.  Come, Tony.\\n\\nTONY.  You had as good not make me, I tell you.  (Measuring.)\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  O lud! he has almost cracked my head.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  O, the monster!  For shame, Tony.  You a man, and\\nbehave so!\\n\\nTONY.  If I'm a man, let me have my fortin.  Ecod! I'll not be made a\\nfool of no longer.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Is this, ungrateful boy, all that I'm to get for the\\npains I have taken in your education?  I that have rocked you in your\\ncradle, and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon!  Did not I work that\\nwaistcoat to make you genteel?  Did not I prescribe for you every day,\\nand weep while the receipt was operating?\\n\\nTONY.  Ecod! you had reason to weep, for you have been dosing me ever\\nsince I was born.  I have gone through every receipt in the Complete\\nHuswife ten times over; and you have thoughts of coursing me through\\nQuincy next spring.  But, ecod! I tell you, I'll not be made a fool of\\nno longer.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Wasn't it all for your good, viper?  Wasn't it all\\nfor your good?\\n\\nTONY.  I wish you'd let me and my good alone, then.  Snubbing this way\\nwhen I'm in spirits.  If I'm to have any good, let it come of itself;\\nnot to keep dinging it, dinging it into one so.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  That's false; I never see you when you're in\\nspirits.  No, Tony, you then go to the alehouse or kennel.  I'm never\\nto be delighted with your agreeable wild notes, unfeeling monster!\\n\\nTONY.  Ecod! mamma, your own notes are the wildest of the two.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Was ever the like?  But I see he wants to break my\\nheart, I see he does.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Dear madam, permit me to lecture the young gentleman a\\nlittle.  I'm certain I can persuade him to his duty.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Well, I must retire.  Come, Constance, my love.  You\\nsee, Mr. Hastings, the wretchedness of my situation: was ever poor\\nwoman so plagued with a dear sweet, pretty, provoking, undutiful boy?\\n[Exeunt MRS. HARDCASTLE and MISS NEVILLE.]\\n\\nTONY.  (Singing.)  \\\"There was a young man riding by, and fain would\\nhave his will.  Rang do didlo dee.\\\"----Don't mind her.  Let her cry.\\nIt's the comfort of her heart.  I have seen her and sister cry over a\\nbook for an hour together; and they said they liked the book the better\\nthe more it made them cry.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Then you're no friend to the ladies, I find, my pretty\\nyoung gentleman?\\n\\nTONY.  That's as I find 'um.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Not to her of your mother's choosing, I dare answer?  And\\nyet she appears to me a pretty well-tempered girl.\\n\\nTONY.  That's because you don't know her as well as I.  Ecod! I know\\nevery inch about her; and there's not a more bitter cantankerous toad\\nin all Christendom.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Aside.)  Pretty encouragement this for a lover!\\n\\nTONY.  I have seen her since the height of that.  She has as many\\ntricks as a hare in a thicket, or a colt the first day's breaking.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  To me she appears sensible and silent.\\n\\nTONY.  Ay, before company.  But when she's with her playmate, she's as\\nloud as a hog in a gate.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But there is a meek modesty about her that charms me.\\n\\nTONY.  Yes, but curb her never so little, she kicks up, and you're\\nflung in a ditch.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Well, but you must allow her a little beauty.--Yes, you must\\nallow her some beauty.\\n\\nTONY.  Bandbox!  She's all a made-up thing, mun.  Ah! could you but see\\nBet Bouncer of these parts, you might then talk of beauty.  Ecod, she\\nhas two eyes as black as sloes, and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit\\ncushion.  She'd make two of she.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter\\nbargain off your hands?\\n\\nTONY.  Anon.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Would you thank him that would take Miss Neville, and leave\\nyou to happiness and your dear Betsy?\\n\\nTONY.  Ay; but where is there such a friend, for who would take her?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I am he.  If you but assist me, I'll engage to whip her off\\nto France, and you shall never hear more of her.\\n\\nTONY.  Assist you!  Ecod I will, to the last drop of my blood.  I'll\\nclap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a\\ntwinkling, and may he get you a part of her fortin beside, in jewels,\\nthat you little dream of.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My dear 'squire, this looks like a lad of spirit.\\n\\nTONY.  Come along, then, and you shall see more of my spirit before you\\nhave done with me.\\n\\n(Singing.)\\n\\\"We are the boys\\nThat fears no noise\\nWhere the thundering cannons roar.\\\"  [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE, alone.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  What could my old friend Sir Charles mean by recommending\\nhis son as the modestest young man in town?  To me he appears the most\\nimpudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue.  He has taken\\npossession of the easy chair by the fire-side already.  He took off his\\nboots in the parlour, and desired me to see them taken care of.  I'm\\ndesirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter.  She will\\ncertainly be shocked at it.\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS HARDCASTLE, plainly dressed.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, my Kate, I see you have changed your dress, as I\\nbade you; and yet, I believe, there was no great occasion.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I find such a pleasure, sir, in obeying your\\ncommands, that I take care to observe them without ever debating their\\npropriety.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And yet, Kate, I sometimes give you some cause,\\nparticularly when I recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover\\nto-day.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  You taught me to expect something extraordinary, and\\nI find the original exceeds the description.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I was never so surprised in my life!  He has quite\\nconfounded all my faculties!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I never saw anything like it: and a man of the world\\ntoo!\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, he learned it all abroad--what a fool was I, to think\\na young man could learn modesty by travelling.  He might as soon learn\\nwit at a masquerade.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  It seems all natural to him.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  A good deal assisted by bad company and a French\\ndancing-master.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Sure you mistake, papa!  A French dancing-master\\ncould never have taught him that timid look--that awkward address--that\\nbashful manner--\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Whose look?  whose manner, child?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Mr. Marlow's: his mauvaise honte, his timidity,\\nstruck me at the first sight.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Then your first sight deceived you; for I think him one of\\nthe most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Sure, sir, you rally!  I never saw any one so\\nmodest.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And can you be serious?  I never saw such a bouncing,\\nswaggering puppy since I was born.  Bully Dawson was but a fool to him.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Surprising!  He met me with a respectful bow, a\\nstammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  He met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a\\nfamiliarity that made my blood freeze again.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  He treated me with diffidence and respect; censured\\nthe manners of the age; admired the prudence of girls that never\\nlaughed; tired me with apologies for being tiresome; then left the room\\nwith a bow, and \\\"Madam, I would not for the world detain you.\\\"\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before;\\nasked twenty questions, and never waited for an answer; interrupted my\\nbest remarks with some silly pun; and when I was in my best story of\\nthe Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, he asked if I had not a good\\nhand at making punch.  Yes, Kate, he asked your father if he was a\\nmaker of punch!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  One of us must certainly be mistaken.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  If he be what he has shown himself, I'm determined he\\nshall never have my consent.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And if he be the sullen thing I take him, he shall\\nnever have mine.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  In one thing then we are agreed--to reject him.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Yes: but upon conditions.  For if you should find him\\nless impudent, and I more presuming--if you find him more respectful,\\nand I more importunate--I don't know--the fellow is well enough for a\\nman--Certainly, we don't meet many such at a horse-race in the country.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  If we should find him so----But that's impossible.  The\\nfirst appearance has done my business.  I'm seldom deceived in that.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And yet there may be many good qualities under that\\nfirst appearance.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste, she\\nthen sets about guessing the rest of his furniture.  With her, a smooth\\nface stands for good sense, and a genteel figure for every virtue.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I hope, sir, a conversation begun with a compliment\\nto my good sense, won't end with a sneer at my understanding?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Pardon me, Kate.  But if young Mr. Brazen can find the art\\nof reconciling contradictions, he may please us both, perhaps.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And as one of us must be mistaken, what if we go to\\nmake further discoveries?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Agreed.  But depend on't I'm in the right.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And depend on't I'm not much in the wrong.\\n[Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nEnter Tony, running in with a casket.\\n\\n\\nTONY.  Ecod! I have got them.  Here they are.  My cousin Con's\\nnecklaces, bobs and all.  My mother shan't cheat the poor souls out of\\ntheir fortin neither.  O! my genus, is that you?\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My dear friend, how have you managed with your mother?  I\\nhope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin, and that\\nyou are willing to be reconciled at last?  Our horses will be refreshed\\nin a short time, and we shall soon be ready to set off.\\n\\nTONY.  And here's something to bear your charges by the way (giving the\\ncasket); your sweetheart's jewels.  Keep them: and hang those, I say,\\nthat would rob you of one of them.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But how have you procured them from your mother?\\n\\nTONY.  Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no fibs.  I procured them\\nby the rule of thumb.  If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's\\nbureau, how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do?  An honest man\\nmay rob himself of his own at any time.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Thousands do it every day.  But to be plain with you; Miss\\nNeville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very\\ninstant.  If she succeeds, it will be the most delicate way at least of\\nobtaining them.\\n\\nTONY.  Well, keep them, till you know how it will be.  But I know how\\nit will be well enough; she'd as soon part with the only sound tooth in\\nher head.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But I dread the effects of her resentment, when she finds\\nshe has lost them.\\n\\nTONY.  Never you mind her resentment, leave ME to manage that.  I\\ndon't value her resentment the bounce of a cracker.  Zounds! here they\\nare.  Morrice! Prance!  [Exit HASTINGS.]\\n\\n\\nEnter MRS. HARDCASTLE and MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Indeed, Constance, you amaze me.  Such a girl as you\\nwant jewels!  It will be time enough for jewels, my dear, twenty years\\nhence, when your beauty begins to want repairs.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  But what will repair beauty at forty, will certainly\\nimprove it at twenty, madam.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Yours, my dear, can admit of none.  That natural\\nblush is beyond a thousand ornaments.  Besides, child, jewels are quite\\nout at present.  Don't you see half the ladies of our acquaintance, my\\nLady Kill-daylight, and Mrs. Crump, and the rest of them, carry their\\njewels to town, and bring nothing but paste and marcasites back.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  But who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be\\nnameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Consult your glass, my dear, and then see if, with\\nsuch a pair of eyes, you want any better sparklers.  What do you think,\\nTony, my dear? does your cousin Con. want any jewels in your eyes to\\nset off her beauty?\\n\\nTONY.  That's as thereafter may be.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  My dear aunt, if you knew how it would oblige me.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  A parcel of old-fashioned rose and table-cut things.\\nThey would make you look like the court of King Solomon at a\\npuppet-show.  Besides, I believe, I can't readily come at them.  They\\nmay be missing, for aught I know to the contrary.\\n\\nTONY.  (Apart to MRS. HARDCASTLE.)  Then why don't you tell her so at\\nonce, as she's so longing for them?  Tell her they're lost.  It's the\\nonly way to quiet her.  Say they're lost, and call me to bear witness.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (Apart to TONY.)  You know, my dear, I'm only\\nkeeping them for you.  So if I say they're gone, you'll bear me\\nwitness, will you?  He! he! he!\\n\\nTONY.  Never fear me.  Ecod! I'll say I saw them taken out with my own\\neyes.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I desire them but for a day, madam.  Just to be\\npermitted to show them as relics, and then they may be locked up\\nagain.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  To be plain with you, my dear Constance, if I could\\nfind them you should have them.  They're missing, I assure you.  Lost,\\nfor aught I know; but we must have patience wherever they are.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I'll not believe it! this is but a shallow pretence to\\ndeny me.  I know they are too valuable to be so slightly kept, and as\\nyou are to answer for the loss--\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Don't be alarmed, Constance.  If they be lost, I must\\nrestore an equivalent.  But my son knows they are missing, and not to\\nbe found.\\n\\nTONY.  That I can bear witness to.  They are missing, and not to be\\nfound; I'll take my oath on't.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  You must learn resignation, my dear; for though we\\nlose our fortune, yet we should not lose our patience.  See me, how\\ncalm I am.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Ay, people are generally calm at the misfortunes of\\nothers.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Now I wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a\\nthought upon such trumpery.  We shall soon find them; and in the mean\\ntime you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I detest garnets.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  The most becoming things in the world to set off a\\nclear complexion.  You have often seen how well they look upon me.  You\\nSHALL have them.  [Exit.]\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I dislike them of all things.  You shan't stir.--Was\\never anything so provoking, to mislay my own jewels, and force me to\\nwear her trumpery?\\n\\nTONY.  Don't be a fool.  If she gives you the garnets, take what you\\ncan get.  The jewels are your own already.  I have stolen them out of\\nher bureau, and she does not know it.  Fly to your spark, he'll tell\\nyou more of the matter.  Leave me to manage her.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  My dear cousin!\\n\\nTONY.  Vanish.  She's here, and has missed them already.  [Exit MISS\\nNEVILLE.] Zounds! how she fidgets and spits about like a Catherine\\nwheel.\\n\\n\\nEnter MRS. HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Confusion! thieves! robbers! we are cheated,\\nplundered, broke open, undone.\\n\\nTONY.  What's the matter, what's the matter, mamma?  I hope nothing has\\nhappened to any of the good family!\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  We are robbed.  My bureau has been broken open, the\\njewels taken out, and I'm undone.\\n\\nTONY.  Oh! is that all?  Ha! ha! ha!  By the laws, I never saw it\\nacted better in my life.  Ecod, I thought you was ruined in earnest,\\nha! ha! ha!\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Why, boy, I AM ruined in earnest.  My bureau has been\\nbroken open, and all taken away.\\n\\nTONY.  Stick to that: ha! ha! ha! stick to that.  I'll bear witness,\\nyou know; call me to bear witness.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I tell you, Tony, by all that's precious, the jewels\\nare gone, and I shall be ruined for ever.\\n\\nTONY.  Sure I know they're gone, and I'm to say so.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  My dearest Tony, but hear me.  They're gone, I say.\\n\\nTONY.  By the laws, mamma, you make me for to laugh, ha! ha!  I know\\nwho took them well enough, ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Was there ever such a blockhead, that can't tell the\\ndifference between jest and earnest?  I tell you I'm not in jest,\\nbooby.\\n\\nTONY.  That's right, that's right; you must be in a bitter passion, and\\nthen nobody will suspect either of us.  I'll bear witness that they are\\ngone.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Was there ever such a cross-grained brute, that\\nwon't hear me?  Can you bear witness that you're no better than a\\nfool?  Was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand, and\\nthieves on the other?\\n\\nTONY.  I can bear witness to that.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Bear witness again, you blockhead you, and I'll turn\\nyou out of the room directly.  My poor niece, what will become of her?\\nDo you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?\\n\\nTONY.  I can bear witness to that.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Do you insult me, monster?  I'll teach you to vex\\nyour mother, I will.\\n\\nTONY.  I can bear witness to that.  [He runs off, she follows him.]\\n\\n\\nEnter Miss HARDCASTLE and Maid.\\n\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  What an unaccountable creature is that brother of\\nmine, to send them to the house as an inn! ha! ha!  I don't wonder at\\nhis impudence.\\n\\nMAID.  But what is more, madam, the young gentleman, as you passed by\\nin your present dress, asked me if you were the bar-maid.  He mistook\\nyou for the bar-maid, madam.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Did he?  Then as I live, I'm resolved to keep up the\\ndelusion.  Tell me, Pimple, how do you like my present dress?  Don't\\nyou think I look something like Cherry in the Beaux Stratagem?\\n\\nMAID.  It's the dress, madam, that every lady wears in the country, but\\nwhen she visits or receives company.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And are you sure he does not remember my face or\\nperson?\\n\\nMAID.  Certain of it.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I vow, I thought so; for, though we spoke for some\\ntime together, yet his fears were such, that he never once looked up\\nduring the interview.  Indeed, if he had, my bonnet would have kept him\\nfrom seeing me.\\n\\nMAID.  But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  In the first place I shall be seen, and that is no\\nsmall advantage to a girl who brings her face to market.  Then I shall\\nperhaps make an acquaintance, and that's no small victory gained over\\none who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex.  But my chief\\naim is, to take my gentleman off his guard, and, like an invisible\\nchampion of romance, examine the giant's force before I offer to\\ncombat.\\n\\nMAID.  But you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice\\nso that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Never fear me.  I think I have got the true bar\\ncant--Did your honour call?--Attend the Lion there--Pipes and tobacco\\nfor the Angel.--The Lamb has been outrageous this half-hour.\\n\\nMAID.  It will do, madam.  But he's here.  [Exit MAID.]\\n\\n\\nEnter MARLOW.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  What a bawling in every part of the house!  I have scarce a\\nmoment's repose.  If I go to the best room, there I find my host and\\nhis story: if I fly to the gallery, there we have my hostess with her\\ncurtsey down to the ground.  I have at last got a moment to myself, and\\nnow for recollection.  [Walks and muses.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Did you call, sir?  Did your honour call?\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Musing.)  As for Miss Hardcastle, she's too grave and\\nsentimental for me.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Did your honour call?  (She still places herself\\nbefore him, he turning away.)\\n\\nMARLOW.  No, child.  (Musing.)  Besides, from the glimpse I had of her,\\nI think she squints.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I'm sure, sir, I heard the bell ring.\\n\\nMARLOW.  No, no.  (Musing.)  I have pleased my father, however, by\\ncoming down, and I'll to-morrow please myself by returning.  [Taking\\nout his tablets, and perusing.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?\\n\\nMARLOW.  I tell you, no.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I should be glad to know, sir.  We have such a\\nparcel of servants!\\n\\nMARLOW.  No, no, I tell you.  (Looks full in her face.)  Yes, child, I\\nthink I did call.  I wanted--I wanted--I vow, child, you are vastly\\nhandsome.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  O la, sir, you'll make one ashamed.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Never saw a more sprightly malicious eye.  Yes, yes, my dear,\\nI did call.  Have you got any of your--a--what d'ye call it in the\\nhouse?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  No, sir, we have been out of that these ten days.\\n\\nMARLOW.  One may call in this house, I find, to very little purpose.\\nSuppose I should call for a taste, just by way of a trial, of the\\nnectar of your lips; perhaps I might be disappointed in that too.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Nectar! nectar!  That's a liquor there's no call for\\nin these parts.  French, I suppose.  We sell no French wines here, sir.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Of true English growth, I assure you.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Then it's odd I should not know it.  We brew all\\nsorts of wines in this house, and I have lived here these eighteen\\nyears.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Eighteen years!  Why, one would think, child, you kept the bar\\nbefore you were born.  How old are you?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  O! sir, I must not tell my age.  They say women and\\nmusic should never be dated.\\n\\nMARLOW.  To guess at this distance, you can't be much above forty\\n(approaching).  Yet, nearer, I don't think so much (approaching).  By\\ncoming close to some women they look younger still; but when we come\\nvery close indeed--(attempting to kiss her).\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Pray, sir, keep your distance.  One would think you\\nwanted to know one's age, as they do horses, by mark of mouth.\\n\\nMARLOW.  I protest, child, you use me extremely ill.  If you keep me at\\nthis distance, how is it possible you and I can ever be acquainted?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And who wants to be acquainted with you?  I want no\\nsuch acquaintance, not I.  I'm sure you did not treat Miss Hardcastle,\\nthat was here awhile ago, in this obstropalous manner.  I'll warrant\\nme, before her you looked dashed, and kept bowing to the ground, and\\ntalked, for all the world, as if you was before a justice of peace.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  Egad, she has hit it, sure enough!  (To her.)  In\\nawe of her, child?  Ha! ha! ha!  A mere awkward squinting thing; no,\\nno.  I find you don't know me.  I laughed and rallied her a little; but\\nI was unwilling to be too severe.  No, I could not be too severe, curse\\nme!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  O! then, sir, you are a favourite, I find, among the\\nladies?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, my dear, a great favourite.  And yet hang me, I don't see\\nwhat they find in me to follow.  At the Ladies' Club in town I'm called\\ntheir agreeable Rattle.  Rattle, child, is not my real name, but one\\nI'm known by.  My name is Solomons; Mr. Solomons, my dear, at your\\nservice.  (Offering to salute her.)\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Hold, sir; you are introducing me to your club, not\\nto yourself.  And you're so great a favourite there, you say?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, my dear.  There's Mrs. Mantrap, Lady Betty Blackleg, the\\nCountess of Sligo, Mrs. Langhorns, old Miss Biddy Buckskin, and your\\nhumble servant, keep up the spirit of the place.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Then it's a very merry place, I suppose?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, as merry as cards, supper, wine, and old women can make\\nus.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And their agreeable Rattle, ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  Egad! I don't quite like this chit.  She looks\\nknowing, methinks.  You laugh, child?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I can't but laugh, to think what time they all have\\nfor minding their work or their family.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  All's well; she don't laugh at me.  (To her.)  Do\\nyou ever work, child?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Ay, sure.  There's not a screen or quilt in the\\nwhole house but what can bear witness to that.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Odso! then you must show me your embroidery.  I embroider and\\ndraw patterns myself a little.  If you want a judge of your work, you\\nmust apply to me.  (Seizing her hand.)\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Ay, but the colours do not look well by candlelight.\\nYou shall see all in the morning.  (Struggling.)\\n\\nMARLOW.  And why not now, my angel?  Such beauty fires beyond the\\npower of resistance.--Pshaw! the father here!  My old luck: I never\\nnicked seven that I did not throw ames ace three times following.\\n[Exit MARLOW.]\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE, who stands in surprise.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  So, madam.  So, I find THIS is your MODEST lover.  This is\\nyour humble admirer, that kept his eyes fixed on the ground, and only\\nadored at humble distance.  Kate, Kate, art thou not ashamed to deceive\\nyour father so?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Never trust me, dear papa, but he's still the modest\\nman I first took him for; you'll be convinced of it as well as I.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  By the hand of my body, I believe his impudence is\\ninfectious!  Didn't I see him seize your hand?  Didn't I see him haul\\nyou about like a milkmaid?  And now you talk of his respect and his\\nmodesty, forsooth!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  But if I shortly convince you of his modesty, that he\\nhas only the faults that will pass off with time, and the virtues that\\nwill improve with age, I hope you'll forgive him.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  The girl would actually make one run mad!  I tell you,\\nI'll not be convinced.  I am convinced.  He has scarce been three hours\\nin the house, and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives.\\nYou may like his impudence, and call it modesty; but my son-in-law,\\nmadam, must have very different qualifications.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Sir, I ask but this night to convince you.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  You shall not have half the time, for I have thoughts of\\nturning him out this very hour.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Give me that hour then, and I hope to satisfy you.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, an hour let it be then.  But I'll have no trifling\\nwith your father.  All fair and open, do you mind me.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I hope, sir, you have ever found that I considered\\nyour commands as my pride; for your kindness is such, that my duty as\\nyet has been inclination.  [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS and MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  You surprise me; Sir Charles Marlow expected here this\\nnight!  Where have you had your information?\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  You may depend upon it.  I just saw his letter to Mr.\\nHardcastle, in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours\\nafter his son.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Then, my Constance, all must be completed before he\\narrives.  He knows me; and should he find me here, would discover my\\nname, and perhaps my designs, to the rest of the family.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  The jewels, I hope, are safe?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Yes, yes, I have sent them to Marlow, who keeps the keys of\\nour baggage.  In the mean time, I'll go to prepare matters for our\\nelopement.  I have had the 'squire's promise of a fresh pair of horses;\\nand if I should not see him again, will write him further directions.\\n[Exit.]\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Well! success attend you.  In the mean time I'll go and\\namuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin.\\n[Exit.]\\n\\n\\nEnter MARLOW, followed by a Servant.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a\\nthing as a casket to keep for him, when he knows the only place I have\\nis the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door.  Have you deposited the\\ncasket with the landlady, as I ordered you?  Have you put it into her\\nown hands?\\n\\nSERVANT.  Yes, your honour.\\n\\nMARLOW.  She said she'd keep it safe, did she?\\n\\nSERVANT.  Yes, she said she'd keep it safe enough; she asked me how I\\ncame by it; and she said she had a great mind to make me give an\\naccount of myself.  [Exit Servant.]\\n\\nMARLOW.  Ha! ha! ha!  They're safe, however.  What an unaccountable set\\nof beings have we got amongst!  This little bar-maid though runs in my\\nhead most strangely, and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of\\nthe family.  She's mine, she must be mine, or I'm greatly mistaken.\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Bless me!  I quite forgot to tell her that I intended to\\nprepare at the bottom of the garden.  Marlow here, and in spirits too!\\n\\nMARLOW.  Give me joy, George!  Crown me, shadow me with laurels!\\nWell, George, after all, we modest fellows don't want for success\\namong the women.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Some women, you mean.  But what success has your honour's\\nmodesty been crowned with now, that it grows so insolent upon us?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Didn't you see the tempting, brisk, lovely little thing, that\\nruns about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Well, and what then?\\n\\nMARLOW.  She's mine, you rogue you.  Such fire, such motion, such\\neyes, such lips; but, egad! she would not let me kiss them though.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But are you so sure, so very sure of her?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Why, man, she talked of showing me her work above stairs, and\\nI am to improve the pattern.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But how can you, Charles, go about to rob a woman of her\\nhonour?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Pshaw! pshaw!  We all know the honour of the bar-maid of an\\ninn.  I don't intend to rob her, take my word for it; there's nothing\\nin this house I shan't honestly pay for.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I believe the girl has virtue.\\n\\nMARLOW.  And if she has, I should be the last man in the world that\\nwould attempt to corrupt it.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  You have taken care, I hope, of the casket I sent you to\\nlock up?  Is it in safety?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Yes, yes.  It's safe enough.  I have taken care of it.  But\\nhow could you think the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door a place of\\nsafety?  Ah! numskull!  I have taken better precautions for you than\\nyou did for yourself----I have----\\n\\nHASTINGS.  What?\\n\\nMARLOW.  I have sent it to the landlady to keep for you.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  To the landlady!\\n\\nMARLOW.  The landlady.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  You did?\\n\\nMARLOW.  I did.  She's to be answerable for its forthcoming, you know.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Yes, she'll bring it forth with a witness.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Wasn't I right?  I believe you'll allow that I acted\\nprudently upon this occasion.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Aside.)  He must not see my uneasiness.\\n\\nMARLOW.  You seem a little disconcerted though, methinks.  Sure\\nnothing has happened?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  No, nothing.  Never was in better spirits in all my life.\\nAnd so you left it with the landlady, who, no doubt, very readily\\nundertook the charge.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Rather too readily.  For she not only kept the casket, but,\\nthrough her great precaution, was going to keep the messenger too.  Ha!\\nha! ha!\\n\\nHASTINGS.  He! he! he!  They're safe, however.\\n\\nMARLOW.  As a guinea in a miser's purse.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (Aside.)  So now all hopes of fortune are at an end, and we\\nmust set off without it.  (To him.)  Well, Charles, I'll leave you to\\nyour meditations on the pretty bar-maid, and, he! he! he! may you be as\\nsuccessful for yourself, as you have been for me!  [Exit.]\\n\\nMARLOW.  Thank ye, George: I ask no more.  Ha! ha! ha!\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I no longer know my own house.  It's turned all\\ntopsy-turvy.  His servants have got drunk already.  I'll bear it no\\nlonger; and yet, from my respect for his father, I'll be calm.  (To\\nhim.)  Mr. Marlow, your servant.  I'm your very humble servant.\\n(Bowing low.)\\n\\nMARLOW.  Sir, your humble servant.  (Aside.)  What's to be the wonder\\nnow?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I believe, sir, you must be sensible, sir, that no man\\nalive ought to be more welcome than your father's son, sir.  I hope you\\nthink so?\\n\\nMARLOW.  I do from my soul, sir.  I don't want much entreaty.  I\\ngenerally make my father's son welcome wherever he goes.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I believe you do, from my soul, sir.  But though I say\\nnothing to your own conduct, that of your servants is insufferable.\\nTheir manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house,\\nI assure you.\\n\\nMARLOW.  I protest, my very good sir, that is no fault of mine.  If\\nthey don't drink as they ought, they are to blame.  I ordered them not\\nto spare the cellar.  I did, I assure you.  (To the side scene.)  Here,\\nlet one of my servants come up.  (To him.)  My positive directions\\nwere, that as I did not drink myself, they should make up for my\\ndeficiencies below.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Then they had your orders for what they do?  I'm\\nsatisfied!\\n\\nMARLOW.  They had, I assure you.  You shall hear from one of\\nthemselves.\\n\\n\\nEnter Servant, drunk.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  You, Jeremy!  Come forward, sirrah!  What were my orders?\\nWere you not told to drink freely, and call for what you thought fit,\\nfor the good of the house?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  I begin to lose my patience.\\n\\nJEREMY.  Please your honour, liberty and Fleet-street for ever!\\nThough I'm but a servant, I'm as good as another man.  I'll drink for\\nno man before supper, sir, damme!  Good liquor will sit upon a good\\nsupper, but a good supper will not sit upon----hiccup----on my\\nconscience, sir.\\n\\nMARLOW.  You see, my old friend, the fellow is as drunk as he can\\npossibly be.  I don't know what you'd have more, unless you'd have the\\npoor devil soused in a beer-barrel.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Zounds! he'll drive me distracted, if I contain myself any\\nlonger.  Mr. Marlow--Sir; I have submitted to your insolence for more\\nthan four hours, and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end.  I'm\\nnow resolved to be master here, sir; and I desire that you and your\\ndrunken pack may leave my house directly.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Leave your house!----Sure you jest, my good friend!  What?\\nwhen I'm doing what I can to please you.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I tell you, sir, you don't please me; so I desire you'll\\nleave my house.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Sure you cannot be serious?  At this time o' night, and such a\\nnight?  You only mean to banter me.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I tell you, sir, I'm serious! and now that my passions are\\nroused, I say this house is mine, sir; this house is mine, and I\\ncommand you to leave it directly.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Ha! ha! ha!  A puddle in a storm.  I shan't stir a step, I\\nassure you.  (In a serious tone.)  This your house, fellow!  It's my\\nhouse.  This is my house.  Mine, while I choose to stay.  What right\\nhave you to bid me leave this house, sir?  I never met with such\\nimpudence, curse me; never in my whole life before.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Nor I, confound me if ever I did.  To come to my house, to\\ncall for what he likes, to turn me out of my own chair, to insult the\\nfamily, to order his servants to get drunk, and then to tell me, \\\"This\\nhouse is mine, sir.\\\"  By all that's impudent, it makes me laugh.  Ha!\\nha! ha!  Pray, sir (bantering), as you take the house, what think you\\nof taking the rest of the furniture?  There's a pair of silver\\ncandlesticks, and there's a fire-screen, and here's a pair of\\nbrazen-nosed bellows; perhaps you may take a fancy to them?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Bring me your bill, sir; bring me your bill, and let's make no\\nmore words about it.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  There are a set of prints, too.  What think you of the\\nRake's Progress, for your own apartment?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Bring me your bill, I say; and I'll leave you and your\\ninfernal house directly.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Then there's a mahogany table that you may see your own\\nface in.\\n\\nMARLOW.  My bill, I say.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I had forgot the great chair for your own particular\\nslumbers, after a hearty meal.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Zounds! bring me my bill, I say, and let's hear no more on't.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Young man, young man, from your father's letter to me, I\\nwas taught to expect a well-bred modest man as a visitor here, but now\\nI find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully; but he will be down\\nhere presently, and shall hear more of it.  [Exit.]\\n\\nMARLOW.  How's this?  Sure I have not mistaken the house.  Everything\\nlooks like an inn.  The servants cry, coming; the attendance is\\nawkward; the bar-maid, too, to attend us.  But she's here, and will\\nfurther inform me.  Whither so fast, child?  A word with you.\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Let it be short, then.  I'm in a hurry.  (Aside.)  I\\nbelieve be begins to find out his mistake.  But it's too soon quite to\\nundeceive him.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Pray, child, answer me one question.  What are you, and what\\nmay your business in this house be?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  A relation of the family, sir.\\n\\nMARLOW.  What, a poor relation.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Yes, sir.  A poor relation, appointed to keep the\\nkeys, and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them.\\n\\nMARLOW.  That is, you act as the bar-maid of this inn.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Inn!  O law----what brought that in your head?  One\\nof the best families in the country keep an inn--Ha! ha! ha! old Mr.\\nHardcastle's house an inn!\\n\\nMARLOW.  Mr. Hardcastle's house!  Is this Mr. Hardcastle's house,\\nchild?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Ay, sure!  Whose else should it be?\\n\\nMARLOW.  So then, all's out, and I have been damnably imposed on.  O,\\nconfound my stupid head, I shall be laughed at over the whole town.  I\\nshall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops.  The DULLISSIMO\\nMACCARONI.  To mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my\\nfather's old friend for an innkeeper!  What a swaggering puppy must he\\ntake me for!  What a silly puppy do I find myself!  There again, may I\\nbe hanged, my dear, but I mistook you for the bar-maid.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Dear me! dear me!  I'm sure there's nothing in my\\nBEHAVIOUR to put me on a level with one of that stamp.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Nothing, my dear, nothing.  But I was in for a list of\\nblunders, and could not help making you a subscriber.  My stupidity saw\\neverything the wrong way.  I mistook your assiduity for assurance, and\\nyour simplicity for allurement.  But it's over.  This house I no more\\nshow MY face in.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I hope, sir, I have done nothing to disoblige you.\\nI'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so\\npolite, and said so many civil things to me.  I'm sure I should be\\nsorry (pretending to cry) if he left the family upon my account.  I'm\\nsure I should be sorry if people said anything amiss, since I have no\\nfortune but my character.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  By Heaven! she weeps.  This is the first mark of\\ntenderness I ever had from a modest woman, and it touches me.  (To\\nher.)  Excuse me, my lovely girl; you are the only part of the family I\\nleave with reluctance.  But to be plain with you, the difference of our\\nbirth, fortune, and education, makes an honourable connexion\\nimpossible; and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity\\nthat trusted in my honour, of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault\\nwas being too lovely.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  Generous man!  I now begin to admire him.\\n(To him.)  But I am sure my family is as good as Miss Hardcastle's; and\\nthough I'm poor, that's no great misfortune to a contented mind; and,\\nuntil this moment, I never thought that it was bad to want fortune.\\n\\nMARLOW.  And why now, my pretty simplicity?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Because it puts me at a distance from one that, if I\\nhad a thousand pounds, I would give it all to.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  This simplicity bewitches me, so that if I stay, I'm\\nundone.  I must make one bold effort, and leave her.  (To her.)  Your\\npartiality in my favour, my dear, touches me most sensibly: and were I\\nto live for myself alone, I could easily fix my choice.  But I owe too\\nmuch to the opinion of the world, too much to the authority of a\\nfather; so that--I can scarcely speak it--it affects me.  Farewell.\\n[Exit.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I never knew half his merit till now.  He shall not\\ngo, if I have power or art to detain him.  I'll still preserve the\\ncharacter in which I STOOPED TO CONQUER; but will undeceive my papa,\\nwho perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution.  [Exit.]\\n\\n\\nEnter Tony and MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nTONY.  Ay, you may steal for yourselves the next time.  I have done my\\nduty.  She has got the jewels again, that's a sure thing; but she\\nbelieves it was all a mistake of the servants.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  But, my dear cousin, sure you won't forsake us in this\\ndistress?  If she in the least suspects that I am going off, I shall\\ncertainly be locked up, or sent to my aunt Pedigree's, which is ten\\ntimes worse.\\n\\nTONY.  To be sure, aunts of all kinds are damned bad things.  But what\\ncan I do?  I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like\\nWhistle-jacket; and I'm sure you can't say but I have courted you\\nnicely before her face.  Here she comes, we must court a bit or two\\nmore, for fear she should suspect us.  [They retire, and seem to\\nfondle.]\\n\\n\\nEnter MRS. HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Well, I was greatly fluttered, to be sure.  But my\\nson tells me it was all a mistake of the servants.  I shan't be easy,\\nhowever, till they are fairly married, and then let her keep her own\\nfortune.  But what do I see? fondling together, as I'm alive.  I never\\nsaw Tony so sprightly before.  Ah! have I caught you, my pretty doves?\\nWhat, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?  Ah!\\n\\nTONY.  As for murmurs, mother, we grumble a little now and then, to be\\nsure.  But there's no love lost between us.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  A mere sprinkling, Tony, upon the flame, only to make\\nit burn brighter.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Cousin Tony promises to give us more of his company at\\nhome.  Indeed, he shan't leave us any more.  It won't leave us, cousin\\nTony, will it?\\n\\nTONY.  O! it's a pretty creature.  No, I'd sooner leave my horse in a\\npound, than leave you when you smile upon one so.  Your laugh makes you\\nso becoming.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Agreeable cousin!  Who can help admiring that natural\\nhumour, that pleasant, broad, red, thoughtless (patting his cheek)--ah!\\nit's a bold face.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Pretty innocence!\\n\\nTONY.  I'm sure I always loved cousin Con.'s hazle eyes, and her\\npretty long fingers, that she twists this way and that over the\\nhaspicholls, like a parcel of bobbins.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Ah! he would charm the bird from the tree.  I was\\nnever so happy before.  My boy takes after his father, poor Mr.\\nLumpkin, exactly.  The jewels, my dear Con., shall be yours\\nincontinently.  You shall have them.  Isn't he a sweet boy, my dear?\\nYou shall be married to-morrow, and we'll put off the rest of his\\neducation, like Dr. Drowsy's sermons, to a fitter opportunity.\\n\\n\\nEnter DIGGORY.\\n\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Where's the 'squire?  I have got a letter for your worship.\\n\\nTONY.  Give it to my mamma.  She reads all my letters first.\\n\\nDIGGORY.  I had orders to deliver it into your own hands.\\n\\nTONY.  Who does it come from?\\n\\nDIGGORY.  Your worship mun ask that o' the letter itself.\\n\\nTONY.  I could wish to know though (turning the letter, and gazing on\\nit).\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  (Aside.)  Undone! undone!  A letter to him from\\nHastings.  I know the hand.  If my aunt sees it, we are ruined for\\never.  I'll keep her employed a little if I can.  (To MRS.\\nHARDCASTLE.)  But I have not told you, madam, of my cousin's smart\\nanswer just now to Mr. Marlow.  We so laughed.--You must know,\\nmadam.--This way a little, for he must not hear us.  [They confer.]\\n\\nTONY.  (Still gazing.)  A damned cramp piece of penmanship, as ever I\\nsaw in my life.  I can read your print hand very well.  But here are\\nsuch handles, and shanks, and dashes, that one can scarce tell the head\\nfrom the tail.--\\\"To Anthony Lumpkin, Esquire.\\\"  It's very odd, I can\\nread the outside of my letters, where my own name is, well enough; but\\nwhen I come to open it, it's all----buzz.  That's hard, very hard; for\\nthe inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Ha! ha! ha!  Very well, very well.  And so my son was\\ntoo hard for the philosopher.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Yes, madam; but you must hear the rest, madam.  A\\nlittle more this way, or he may hear us.  You'll hear how he puzzled\\nhim again.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  He seems strangely puzzled now himself, methinks.\\n\\nTONY.  (Still gazing.)  A damned up and down hand, as if it was\\ndisguised in liquor.--(Reading.)  Dear Sir,--ay, that's that.  Then\\nthere's an M, and a T, and an S, but whether the next be an izzard, or\\nan R, confound me, I cannot tell.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  What's that, my dear?  Can I give you any\\nassistance?\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Pray, aunt, let me read it.  Nobody reads a cramp hand\\nbetter than I. (Twitching the letter from him.)  Do you know who it is\\nfrom?\\n\\nTONY.  Can't tell, except from Dick Ginger, the feeder.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Ay, so it is.  (Pretending to read.)  Dear 'Squire,\\nhoping that you're in health, as I am at this present.  The gentlemen\\nof the Shake-bag club has cut the gentlemen of Goose-green quite out of\\nfeather.  The odds--um--odd battle--um--long fighting--um--here, here,\\nit's all about cocks and fighting; it's of no consequence; here, put it\\nup, put it up.  (Thrusting the crumpled letter upon him.)\\n\\nTONY.  But I tell you, miss, it's of all the consequence in the world.\\nI would not lose the rest of it for a guinea.  Here, mother, do you\\nmake it out.  Of no consequence!  (Giving MRS. HARDCASTLE the letter.)\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  How's this?--(Reads.)  \\\"Dear 'Squire, I'm now\\nwaiting for Miss Neville, with a post-chaise and pair, at the bottom of\\nthe garden, but I find my horses yet unable to perform the journey.  I\\nexpect you'll assist us with a pair of fresh horses, as you promised.\\nDispatch is necessary, as the HAG (ay, the hag), your mother, will\\notherwise suspect us!  Yours, Hastings.\\\"  Grant me patience.  I shall\\nrun distracted!  My rage chokes me.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I hope, madam, you'll suspend your resentment for a few\\nmoments, and not impute to me any impertinence, or sinister design,\\nthat belongs to another.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (Curtseying very low.)  Fine spoken, madam, you are\\nmost miraculously polite and engaging, and quite the very pink of\\ncourtesy and circumspection, madam.  (Changing her tone.)  And you, you\\ngreat ill-fashioned oaf, with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth\\nshut: were you, too, joined against me?  But I'll defeat all your plots\\nin a moment.  As for you, madam, since you have got a pair of fresh\\nhorses ready, it would be cruel to disappoint them.  So, if you please,\\ninstead of running away with your spark, prepare, this very moment, to\\nrun off with ME.  Your old aunt Pedigree will keep you secure, I'll\\nwarrant me.  You too, sir, may mount your horse, and guard us upon the\\nway.  Here, Thomas, Roger, Diggory!  I'll show you, that I wish you\\nbetter than you do yourselves.  [Exit.]\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  So now I'm completely ruined.\\n\\nTONY.  Ay, that's a sure thing.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  What better could be expected from being connected with\\nsuch a stupid fool,--and after all the nods and signs I made him?\\n\\nTONY.  By the laws, miss, it was your own cleverness, and not my\\nstupidity, that did your business.  You were so nice and so busy with\\nyour Shake-bags and Goose-greens, that I thought you could never be\\nmaking believe.\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  So, sir, I find by my servant, that you have shown my\\nletter, and betrayed us.  Was this well done, young gentleman?\\n\\nTONY.  Here's another.  Ask miss there, who betrayed you.  Ecod, it was\\nher doing, not mine.\\n\\n\\nEnter MARLOW.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  So I have been finely used here among you.  Rendered\\ncontemptible, driven into ill manners, despised, insulted, laughed at.\\n\\nTONY.  Here's another.  We shall have old Bedlam broke loose\\npresently.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  And there, sir, is the gentleman to whom we all owe\\nevery obligation.\\n\\nMARLOW.  What can I say to him, a mere boy, an idiot, whose ignorance\\nand age are a protection?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  A poor contemptible booby, that would but disgrace\\ncorrection.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Yet with cunning and malice enough to make himself\\nmerry with all our embarrassments.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  An insensible cub.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Replete with tricks and mischief.\\n\\nTONY.  Baw! damme, but I'll fight you both, one after the\\nother----with baskets.\\n\\nMARLOW.  As for him, he's below resentment.  But your conduct, Mr.\\nHastings, requires an explanation.  You knew of my mistakes, yet would\\nnot undeceive me.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Tortured as I am with my own disappointments, is this a time\\nfor explanations?  It is not friendly, Mr. Marlow.\\n\\nMARLOW.  But, sir----\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Mr. Marlow, we never kept on your mistake till it was\\ntoo late to undeceive you.\\n\\n\\nEnter Servant.\\n\\n\\nSERVANT.  My mistress desires you'll get ready immediately, madam.  The\\nhorses are putting to.  Your hat and things are in the next room.  We\\nare to go thirty miles before morning.  [Exit Servant.]\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Well, well: I'll come presently.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (To HASTINGS.)  Was it well done, sir, to assist in rendering\\nme ridiculous?  To hang me out for the scorn of all my acquaintance?\\nDepend upon it, sir, I shall expect an explanation.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Was it well done, sir, if you're upon that subject, to\\ndeliver what I entrusted to yourself, to the care of another sir?\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Mr. Hastings!  Mr. Marlow!  Why will you increase my\\ndistress by this groundless dispute?  I implore, I entreat you----\\n\\n\\nEnter Servant.\\n\\n\\nSERVANT.  Your cloak, madam.  My mistress is impatient.  [Exit\\nServant.]\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I come.  Pray be pacified.  If I leave you thus, I\\nshall die with apprehension.\\n\\n\\nEnter Servant.\\n\\n\\nSERVANT.  Your fan, muff, and gloves, madam.  The horses are waiting.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  O, Mr. Marlow! if you knew what a scene of constraint\\nand ill-nature lies before me, I'm sure it would convert your\\nresentment into pity.\\n\\nMARLOW.  I'm so distracted with a variety of passions, that I don't\\nknow what I do.  Forgive me, madam.  George, forgive me.  You know my\\nhasty temper, and should not exasperate it.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  The torture of my situation is my only excuse.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Well, my dear Hastings, if you have that esteem for me\\nthat I think, that I am sure you have, your constancy for three years\\nwill but increase the happiness of our future connexion.  If----\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (Within.)  Miss Neville.  Constance, why Constance, I\\nsay.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I'm coming.  Well, constancy, remember, constancy is the\\nword.  [Exit.]\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My heart! how can I support this?  To be so near happiness,\\nand such happiness!\\n\\nMARLOW.  (To Tony.)  You see now, young gentleman, the effects of your\\nfolly.  What might be amusement to you, is here disappointment, and\\neven distress.\\n\\nTONY.  (From a reverie.)  Ecod, I have hit it.  It's here.  Your\\nhands.  Yours and yours, my poor Sulky!--My boots there, ho!--Meet me\\ntwo hours hence at the bottom of the garden; and if you don't find Tony\\nLumpkin a more good-natured fellow than you thought for, I'll give you\\nleave to take my best horse, and Bet Bouncer into the bargain.  Come\\nalong.  My boots, ho!  [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS and Servant.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  You saw the old lady and Miss Neville drive off, you say?\\n\\nSERVANT.  Yes, your honour.  They went off in a post-coach, and the\\nyoung 'squire went on horseback.  They're thirty miles off by this\\ntime.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Then all my hopes are over.\\n\\nSERVANT.  Yes, sir.  Old Sir Charles has arrived.  He and the old\\ngentleman of the house have been laughing at Mr. Marlow's mistake this\\nhalf hour.  They are coming this way.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Then I must not be seen.  So now to my fruitless\\nappointment at the bottom of the garden.  This is about the time.\\n[Exit.]\\n\\n\\nEnter SIR CHARLES and HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ha! ha! ha!  The peremptory tone in which he sent forth\\nhis sublime commands!\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  And the reserve with which I suppose he treated all your\\nadvances.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And yet he might have seen something in me above a common\\ninnkeeper, too.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Yes, Dick, but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper,\\nha! ha! ha!\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, I'm in too good spirits to think of anything but\\njoy.  Yes, my dear friend, this union of our families will make our\\npersonal friendships hereditary; and though my daughter's fortune is\\nbut small--\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Why, Dick, will you talk of fortune to ME?  My son is\\npossessed of more than a competence already, and can want nothing but a\\ngood and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it.  If they\\nlike each other, as you say they do--\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  IF, man!  I tell you they DO like each other.  My\\ndaughter as good as told me so.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  But girls are apt to flatter themselves, you know.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself; and\\nhere he comes to put you out of your IFS, I warrant him.\\n\\n\\nEnter MARLOW.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  I come, sir, once more, to ask pardon for my strange conduct.\\nI can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Tut, boy, a trifle!  You take it too gravely.  An hour or\\ntwo's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again.  She'll\\nnever like you the worse for it.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Sir, I shall be always proud of her approbation.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Approbation is but a cold word, Mr. Marlow; if I am not\\ndeceived, you have something more than approbation thereabouts.  You\\ntake me?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Really, sir, I have not that happiness.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Come, boy, I'm an old fellow, and know what's what as well\\nas you that are younger.  I know what has passed between you; but mum.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Sure, sir, nothing has passed between us but the most\\nprofound respect on my side, and the most distant reserve on hers.  You\\ndon't think, sir, that my impudence has been passed upon all the rest\\nof the family.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Impudence!  No, I don't say that--not quite\\nimpudence--though girls like to be played with, and rumpled a little\\ntoo, sometimes.  But she has told no tales, I assure you.\\n\\nMARLOW.  I never gave her the slightest cause.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Well, well, I like modesty in its place well enough.  But\\nthis is over-acting, young gentleman.  You may be open.  Your father\\nand I will like you all the better for it.\\n\\nMARLOW.  May I die, sir, if I ever----\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I tell you, she don't dislike you; and as I'm sure you\\nlike her----\\n\\nMARLOW.  Dear sir--I protest, sir----\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as\\nthe parson can tie you.\\n\\nMARLOW.  But hear me, sir--\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Your father approves the match, I admire it; every\\nmoment's delay will be doing mischief.  So--\\n\\nMARLOW.  But why won't you hear me?  By all that's just and true, I\\nnever gave Miss Hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment, or even\\nthe most distant hint to suspect me of affection.  We had but one\\ninterview, and that was formal, modest, and uninteresting.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  This fellow's formal modest impudence is beyond\\nbearing.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  And you never grasped her hand, or made any\\nprotestations?\\n\\nMARLOW.  As Heaven is my witness, I came down in obedience to your\\ncommands.  I saw the lady without emotion, and parted without\\nreluctance.  I hope you'll exact no farther proofs of my duty, nor\\nprevent me from leaving a house in which I suffer so many\\nmortifications.  [Exit.]\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  I'm astonished at the air of sincerity with which he\\nparted.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  And I'm astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his\\nassurance.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  I dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Here comes my daughter, and I would stake my happiness\\nupon her veracity.\\n\\n\\nEnter MISS HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Kate, come hither, child.  Answer us sincerely and\\nwithout reserve: has Mr. Marlow made you any professions of love and\\naffection?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  The question is very abrupt, sir.  But since you\\nrequire unreserved sincerity, I think he has.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (To SIR CHARLES.)  You see.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  And pray, madam, have you and my son had more than one\\ninterview?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Yes, sir, several.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (To SIR CHARLES.)  You see.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  But did be profess any attachment?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  A lasting one.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Did he talk of love?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Much, sir.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Amazing!  And all this formally?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Formally.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Now, my friend, I hope you are satisfied.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  And how did he behave, madam?\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  As most profest admirers do: said some civil things\\nof my face, talked much of his want of merit, and the greatness of\\nmine; mentioned his heart, gave a short tragedy speech, and ended with\\npretended rapture.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Now I'm perfectly convinced, indeed.  I know his\\nconversation among women to be modest and submissive: this forward\\ncanting ranting manner by no means describes him; and, I am confident,\\nhe never sat for the picture.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Then, what, sir, if I should convince you to your\\nface of my sincerity?  If you and my papa, in about half an hour, will\\nplace yourselves behind that screen, you shall hear him declare his\\npassion to me in person.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Agreed.  And if I find him what you describe, all my\\nhappiness in him must have an end.  [Exit.]\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  And if you don't find him what I describe--I fear my\\nhappiness must never have a beginning.  [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nSCENE changes to the back of the Garden.\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  What an idiot am I, to wait here for a fellow who probably\\ntakes a delight in mortifying me.  He never intended to be punctual,\\nand I'll wait no longer.  What do I see?  It is he! and perhaps with\\nnews of my Constance.\\n\\n\\nEnter Tony, booted and spattered.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My honest 'squire!  I now find you a man of your word.\\nThis looks like friendship.\\n\\nTONY.  Ay, I'm your friend, and the best friend you have in the world,\\nif you knew but all.  This riding by night, by the bye, is cursedly\\ntiresome.  It has shook me worse than the basket of a stage-coach.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But how? where did you leave your fellow-travellers?  Are\\nthey in safety?  Are they housed?\\n\\nTONY.  Five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad\\ndriving.  The poor beasts have smoked for it: rabbit me, but I'd rather\\nride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Well, but where have you left the ladies?  I die with\\nimpatience.\\n\\nTONY.  Left them!  Why where should I leave them but where I found\\nthem?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  This is a riddle.\\n\\nTONY.  Riddle me this then.  What's that goes round the house, and\\nround the house, and never touches the house?\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I'm still astray.\\n\\nTONY.  Why, that's it, mon.  I have led them astray.  By jingo,\\nthere's not a pond or a slough within five miles of the place but they\\ncan tell the taste of.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Ha! ha! ha! I understand: you took them in a round, while\\nthey supposed themselves going forward, and so you have at last brought\\nthem home again.\\n\\nTONY.  You shall hear.  I first took them down Feather-bed Lane, where\\nwe stuck fast in the mud.  I then rattled them crack over the stones of\\nUp-and-down Hill.  I then introduced them to the gibbet on Heavy-tree\\nHeath; and from that, with a circumbendibus, I fairly lodged them in\\nthe horse-pond at the bottom of the garden.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But no accident, I hope?\\n\\nTONY.  No, no.  Only mother is confoundedly frightened.  She thinks\\nherself forty miles off.  She's sick of the journey; and the cattle can\\nscarce crawl.  So if your own horses be ready, you may whip off with\\ncousin, and I'll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow\\nyou.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My dear friend, how can I be grateful?\\n\\nTONY.  Ay, now it's dear friend, noble 'squire.  Just now, it was all\\nidiot, cub, and run me through the guts.  Damn YOUR way of fighting, I\\nsay.  After we take a knock in this part of the country, we kiss and be\\nfriends.  But if you had run me through the guts, then I should be\\ndead, and you might go kiss the hangman.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  The rebuke is just.  But I must hasten to relieve Miss\\nNeville: if you keep the old lady employed, I promise to take care of\\nthe young one.  [Exit HASTINGS.]\\n\\nTONY.  Never fear me.  Here she comes.  Vanish.  She's got from the\\npond, and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid.\\n\\n\\nEnter MRS. HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Oh, Tony, I'm killed!  Shook!  Battered to death.  I\\nshall never survive it.  That last jolt, that laid us against the\\nquickset hedge, has done my business.\\n\\nTONY.  Alack, mamma, it was all your own fault.  You would be for\\nrunning away by night, without knowing one inch of the way.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I wish we were at home again.  I never met so many\\naccidents in so short a journey.  Drenched in the mud, overturned in a\\nditch, stuck fast in a slough, jolted to a jelly, and at last to lose\\nour way.  Whereabouts do you think we are, Tony?\\n\\nTONY.  By my guess we should come upon Crackskull Common, about forty\\nmiles from home.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  O lud! O lud!  The most notorious spot in all the\\ncountry.  We only want a robbery to make a complete night on't.\\n\\nTONY.  Don't be afraid, mamma, don't be afraid.  Two of the five that\\nkept here are hanged, and the other three may not find us.  Don't be\\nafraid.--Is that a man that's galloping behind us?  No; it's only a\\ntree.--Don't be afraid.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  The fright will certainly kill me.\\n\\nTONY.  Do you see anything like a black hat moving behind the thicket?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Oh, death!\\n\\nTONY.  No; it's only a cow.  Don't be afraid, mamma; don't be afraid.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  As I'm alive, Tony, I see a man coming towards us.\\nAh!  I'm sure on't.  If he perceives us, we are undone.\\n\\nTONY.  (Aside.)  Father-in-law, by all that's unlucky, come to take one\\nof his night walks.  (To her.)  Ah, it's a highwayman with pistols as\\nlong as my arm.  A damned ill-looking fellow.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Good Heaven defend us!  He approaches.\\n\\nTONY.  Do you hide yourself in that thicket, and leave me to manage\\nhim.  If there be any danger, I'll cough, and cry hem.  When I cough,\\nbe sure to keep close.  (MRS. HARDCASTLE hides behind a tree in the\\nback scene.)\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I'm mistaken, or I heard voices of people in want of\\nhelp.  Oh, Tony! is that you?  I did not expect you so soon back.  Are\\nyour mother and her charge in safety?\\n\\nTONY.  Very safe, sir, at my aunt Pedigree's.  Hem.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (From behind.)  Ah, death!  I find there's danger.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Forty miles in three hours; sure that's too much, my\\nyoungster.\\n\\nTONY.  Stout horses and willing minds make short journeys, as they say.\\nHem.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (From behind.)  Sure he'll do the dear boy no harm.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  But I heard a voice here; I should be glad to know from\\nwhence it came.\\n\\nTONY.  It was I, sir, talking to myself, sir.  I was saying that forty\\nmiles in four hours was very good going.  Hem.  As to be sure it was.\\nHem.  I have got a sort of cold by being out in the air.  We'll go in,\\nif you please.  Hem.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  But if you talked to yourself you did not answer\\nyourself.  I'm certain I heard two voices, and am resolved (raising his\\nvoice) to find the other out.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (From behind.)  Oh! he's coming to find me out.  Oh!\\n\\nTONY.  What need you go, sir, if I tell you?  Hem.  I'll lay down my\\nlife for the truth--hem--I'll tell you all, sir.  [Detaining him.]\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I tell you I will not be detained.  I insist on seeing.\\nIt's in vain to expect I'll believe you.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (Running forward from behind.)  O lud! he'll murder\\nmy poor boy, my darling!  Here, good gentleman, whet your rage upon me.\\nTake my money, my life, but spare that young gentleman; spare my child,\\nif you have any mercy.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  My wife, as I'm a Christian.  From whence can she come? or\\nwhat does she mean?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (Kneeling.)  Take compassion on us, good Mr.\\nHighwayman.  Take our money, our watches, all we have, but spare our\\nlives.  We will never bring you to justice; indeed we won't, good Mr.\\nHighwayman.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I believe the woman's out of her senses.  What, Dorothy,\\ndon't you know ME?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Mr. Hardcastle, as I'm alive!  My fears blinded me.\\nBut who, my dear, could have expected to meet you here, in this\\nfrightful place, so far from home?  What has brought you to follow us?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Sure, Dorothy, you have not lost your wits?  So far from\\nhome, when you are within forty yards of your own door!  (To him.)\\nThis is one of your old tricks, you graceless rogue, you.  (To her.)\\nDon't you know the gate, and the mulberry-tree; and don't you remember\\nthe horse-pond, my dear?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Yes, I shall remember the horse-pond as long as I\\nlive; I have caught my death in it.  (To TONY.)  And it is to you, you\\ngraceless varlet, I owe all this?  I'll teach you to abuse your mother,\\nI will.\\n\\nTONY.  Ecod, mother, all the parish says you have spoiled me, and so\\nyou may take the fruits on't.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  I'll spoil you, I will.  [Follows him off the stage.\\nExit.]\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  There's morality, however, in his reply.  [Exit.]\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS and MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My dear Constance, why will you deliberate thus?  If we\\ndelay a moment, all is lost for ever.  Pluck up a little resolution,\\nand we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  I find it impossible.  My spirits are so sunk with the\\nagitations I have suffered, that I am unable to face any new danger.\\nTwo or three years' patience will at last crown us with happiness.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy.  Let us fly,\\nmy charmer.  Let us date our happiness from this very moment.  Perish\\nfortune!  Love and content will increase what we possess beyond a\\nmonarch's revenue.  Let me prevail!\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  No, Mr. Hastings, no.  Prudence once more comes to my\\nrelief, and I will obey its dictates.  In the moment of passion fortune\\nmay be despised, but it ever produces a lasting repentance.  I'm\\nresolved to apply to Mr. Hardcastle's compassion and justice for\\nredress.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  But though he had the will, he has not the power to relieve\\nyou.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  But he has influence, and upon that I am resolved to\\nrely.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  I have no hopes.  But since you persist, I must reluctantly\\nobey you.  [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nSCENE changes.\\n\\n\\nEnter SIR CHARLES and MISS HARDCASTLE.\\n\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  What a situation am I in!  If what you say appears, I\\nshall then find a guilty son.  If what he says be true, I shall then\\nlose one that, of all others, I most wished for a daughter.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  I am proud of your approbation, and to show I merit\\nit, if you place yourselves as I directed, you shall hear his explicit\\ndeclaration.  But he comes.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  I'll to your father, and keep him to the appointment.\\n[Exit SIR CHARLES.]\\n\\n\\nEnter MARLOW.\\n\\n\\nMARLOW.  Though prepared for setting out, I come once more to take\\nleave; nor did I, till this moment, know the pain I feel in the\\nseparation.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  (In her own natural manner.)  I believe sufferings\\ncannot be very great, sir, which you can so easily remove.  A day or\\ntwo longer, perhaps, might lessen your uneasiness, by showing the\\nlittle value of what you now think proper to regret.\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Aside.)  This girl every moment improves upon me.  (To her.)\\nIt must not be, madam.  I have already trifled too long with my heart.\\nMy very pride begins to submit to my passion.  The disparity of\\neducation and fortune, the anger of a parent, and the contempt of my\\nequals, begin to lose their weight; and nothing can restore me to\\nmyself but this painful effort of resolution.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Then go, sir:  I'll urge nothing more to detain you.\\nThough my family be as good as hers you came down to visit, and my\\neducation, I hope, not inferior, what are these advantages without\\nequal affluence?  I must remain contented with the slight approbation\\nof imputed merit; I must have only the mockery of your addresses, while\\nall your serious aims are fixed on fortune.\\n\\n\\nEnter HARDCASTLE and SIR CHARLES from behind.\\n\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Here, behind this screen.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Ay, ay; make no noise.  I'll engage my Kate covers him\\nwith confusion at last.\\n\\nMARLOW.  By heavens, madam! fortune was ever my smallest\\nconsideration.  Your beauty at first caught my eye; for who could see\\nthat without emotion?  But every moment that I converse with you steals\\nin some new grace, heightens the picture, and gives it stronger\\nexpression.  What at first seemed rustic plainness, now appears refined\\nsimplicity.  What seemed forward assurance, now strikes me as the\\nresult of courageous innocence and conscious virtue.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  What can it mean?  He amazes me!\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  I told you how it would be.  Hush!\\n\\nMARLOW.  I am now determined to stay, madam; and I have too good an\\nopinion of my father's discernment, when he sees you, to doubt his\\napprobation.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  No, Mr. Marlow, I will not, cannot detain you.  Do\\nyou think I could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest\\nroom for repentance?  Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a\\ntransient passion, to load you with confusion?  Do you think I could\\never relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours?\\n\\nMARLOW.  By all that's good, I can have no happiness but what's in your\\npower to grant me!  Nor shall I ever feel repentance but in not having\\nseen your merits before.  I will stay even contrary to your wishes; and\\nthough you should persist to shun me, I will make my respectful\\nassiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct.\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Sir, I must entreat you'll desist.  As our\\nacquaintance began, so let it end, in indifference.  I might have\\ngiven an hour or two to levity; but seriously, Mr. Marlow, do you\\nthink I could ever submit to a connexion where I must appear\\nmercenary, and you imprudent?  Do you think I could ever catch at the\\nconfident addresses of a secure admirer?\\n\\nMARLOW.  (Kneeling.)  Does this look like security?  Does this look\\nlike confidence?  No, madam, every moment that shows me your merit,\\nonly serves to increase my diffidence and confusion.  Here let me\\ncontinue----\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  I can hold it no longer.  Charles, Charles, how hast thou\\ndeceived me!  Is this your indifference, your uninteresting\\nconversation?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Your cold contempt; your formal interview!  What have you\\nto say now?\\n\\nMARLOW.  That I'm all amazement!  What can it mean?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure:\\nthat you can address a lady in private, and deny it in public: that you\\nhave one story for us, and another for my daughter.\\n\\nMARLOW.  Daughter!--This lady your daughter?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Yes, sir, my only daughter; my Kate; whose else should she\\nbe?\\n\\nMARLOW.  Oh, the devil!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  Yes, sir, that very identical tall squinting lady you\\nwere pleased to take me for (courtseying); she that you addressed as\\nthe mild, modest, sentimental man of gravity, and the bold, forward,\\nagreeable Rattle of the Ladies' Club.  Ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nMARLOW.  Zounds! there's no bearing this; it's worse than death!\\n\\nMISS HARDCASTLE.  In which of your characters, sir, will you give us\\nleave to address you?  As the faltering gentleman, with looks on the\\nground, that speaks just to be heard, and hates hypocrisy; or the loud\\nconfident creature, that keeps it up with Mrs. Mantrap, and old Miss\\nBiddy Buckskin, till three in the morning?  Ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nMARLOW.  O, curse on my noisy head.  I never attempted to be impudent\\nyet, that I was not taken down.  I must be gone.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  By the hand of my body, but you shall not.  I see it was\\nall a mistake, and I am rejoiced to find it.  You shall not, sir, I\\ntell you.  I know she'll forgive you.  Won't you forgive him, Kate?\\nWe'll all forgive you.  Take courage, man.  (They retire, she\\ntormenting him, to the back scene.)\\n\\n\\nEnter MRS. HARDCASTLE and Tony.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  So, so, they're gone off.  Let them go, I care not.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Who gone?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  My dutiful niece and her gentleman, Mr. Hastings,\\nfrom town.  He who came down with our modest visitor here.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  Who, my honest George Hastings?  As worthy a fellow as\\nlives, and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Then, by the hand of my body, I'm proud of the connexion.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Well, if he has taken away the lady, he has not\\ntaken her fortune; that remains in this family to console us for her\\nloss.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Sure, Dorothy, you would not be so mercenary?\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Ay, that's my affair, not yours.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  But you know if your son, when of age, refuses to marry\\nhis cousin, her whole fortune is then at her own disposal.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Ay, but he's not of age, and she has not thought\\nproper to wait for his refusal.\\n\\n\\nEnter HASTINGS and MISS NEVILLE.\\n\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  (Aside.)  What, returned so soon!  I begin not to\\nlike it.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (To HARDCASTLE.)  For my late attempt to fly off with your\\nniece let my present confusion be my punishment.  We are now come back,\\nto appeal from your justice to your humanity.  By her father's consent,\\nI first paid her my addresses, and our passions were first founded in\\nduty.\\n\\nMISS NEVILLE.  Since his death, I have been obliged to stoop to\\ndissimulation to avoid oppression.  In an hour of levity, I was ready\\nto give up my fortune to secure my choice.  But I am now recovered from\\nthe delusion, and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a\\nnearer connexion.\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  Pshaw, pshaw! this is all but the whining end of a\\nmodern novel.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Be it what it will, I'm glad they're come back to reclaim\\ntheir due.  Come hither, Tony, boy.  Do you refuse this lady's hand\\nwhom I now offer you?\\n\\nTONY.  What signifies my refusing?  You know I can't refuse her till\\nI'm of age, father.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  While I thought concealing your age, boy, was likely to\\nconduce to your improvement, I concurred with your mother's desire to\\nkeep it secret.  But since I find she turns it to a wrong use, I must\\nnow declare you have been of age these three months.\\n\\nTONY.  Of age!  Am I of age, father?\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  Above three months.\\n\\nTONY.  Then you'll see the first use I'll make of my liberty.  (Taking\\nMISS NEVILLE's hand.)  Witness all men by these presents, that I,\\nAnthony Lumpkin, Esquire, of BLANK place, refuse you, Constantia\\nNeville, spinster, of no place at all, for my true and lawful wife.  So\\nConstance Neville may marry whom she pleases, and Tony Lumpkin is his\\nown man again.\\n\\nSIR CHARLES.  O brave 'squire!\\n\\nHASTINGS.  My worthy friend!\\n\\nMRS. HARDCASTLE.  My undutiful offspring!\\n\\nMARLOW.  Joy, my dear George!  I give you joy sincerely.  And could I\\nprevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary, I should be\\nthe happiest man alive, if you would return me the favour.\\n\\nHASTINGS.  (To MISS HARDCASTLE.)  Come, madam, you are now driven to\\nthe very last scene of all your contrivances.  I know you like him, I'm\\nsure he loves you, and you must and shall have him.\\n\\nHARDCASTLE.  (Joining their hands.)  And I say so too.  And, Mr.\\nMarlow, if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter, I don't\\nbelieve you'll ever repent your bargain.  So now to supper.  To-morrow\\nwe shall gather all the poor of the parish about us, and the mistakes\\nof the night shall be crowned with a merry morning.  So, boy, take her;\\nand as you have been mistaken in the mistress, my wish is, that you may\\nnever be mistaken in the wife.  [Exeunt Omnes.]\",\n          \"On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was\\nsinging in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York.\\n\\nThough there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan\\ndistances \\\"above the Forties,\\\" of a new Opera House which should\\ncompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European\\ncapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every\\nwinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy.\\nConservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus\\nkeeping out the \\\"new people\\\" whom New York was beginning to dread and\\nyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic\\nassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so\\nproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.\\n\\nIt was Madame Nilsson's first appearance that winter, and what the\\ndaily press had already learned to describe as \\\"an exceptionally\\nbrilliant audience\\\" had gathered to hear her, transported through the\\nslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family\\nlandau, or in the humbler but more convenient \\\"Brown coupe.\\\" To come to\\nthe Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\\nas in one's own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in\\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\\none's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy.  It was\\none of the great livery-stableman's most masterly intuitions to have\\ndiscovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more\\nquickly than they want to get to it.\\n\\nWhen Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene.  There was no reason why\\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\\ncigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs.\\nArcher allowed smoking.  But, in the first place, New York was a\\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \\\"not the\\nthing\\\" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not \\\"the\\nthing\\\" played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as the\\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\\nforefathers thousands of years ago.\\n\\nThe second reason for his delay was a personal one.  He had dawdled\\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\\nrealisation.  This was especially the case when the pleasure was a\\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\\ndonna's stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more\\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  \\\"He loves me--he\\nloves me not--HE LOVES ME!--\\\" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\\nwith notes as clear as dew.\\n\\nShe sang, of course, \\\"M'ama!\\\" and not \\\"he loves me,\\\" since an\\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\\nGerman text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be\\ntranslated into Italian for the clearer understanding of\\nEnglish-speaking audiences.  This seemed as natural to Newland Archer\\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.\\n\\n\\\"M'ama ... non m'ama ...\\\" the prima donna sang, and \\\"M'ama!\\\", with a\\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\\nthe little brown Faust-Capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\\nvictim.\\n\\nNewland Archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\\nhouse.  Directly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott,\\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\\nattend the Opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\\nby some of the younger members of the family.  On this occasion, the\\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott, and her daughter, Mrs. Welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\\nfixed on the stagelovers.  As Madame Nilsson's \\\"M'ama!\\\" thrilled out\\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\\nDaisy Song) a warm pink mounted to the girl's cheek, mantled her brow\\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\\nsingle gardenia.  She dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and Newland Archer saw her\\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly.  He drew a breath of\\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage.\\n\\nNo expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\\nOpera houses of Paris and Vienna.  The foreground, to the footlights,\\nwas covered with emerald green cloth.  In the middle distance\\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\\nand red roses.  Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank's far-off\\nprodigies.\\n\\nIn the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white\\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul's\\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\\nthe right wing.\\n\\n\\\"The darling!\\\" thought Newland Archer, his glance flitting back to the\\nyoung girl with the lilies-of-the-valley.  \\\"She doesn't even guess what\\nit's all about.\\\" And he contemplated her absorbed young face with a\\nthrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation\\nwas mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity.  \\\"We'll\\nread Faust together ... by the Italian lakes ...\\\" he thought, somewhat\\nhazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the\\nmasterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to\\nreveal to his bride.  It was only that afternoon that May Welland had\\nlet him guess that she \\\"cared\\\" (New York's consecrated phrase of maiden\\navowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement\\nring, the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin, pictured her at\\nhis side in some scene of old European witchery.\\n\\nHe did not in the least wish the future Mrs. Newland Archer to be a\\nsimpleton.  He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to\\ndevelop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own\\nwith the most popular married women of the \\\"younger set,\\\" in which it\\nwas the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully\\ndiscouraging it.  If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he\\nsometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife\\nshould be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady\\nwhose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years;\\nwithout, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred\\nthat unhappy being's life, and had disarranged his own plans for a\\nwhole winter.\\n\\nHow this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain\\nitself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but\\nhe was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it\\nwas that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated,\\nbutton-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club\\nbox, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their\\nopera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product\\nof the system.  In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer\\nfelt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old\\nNew York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even\\nseen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number.\\nSingly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they\\nrepresented \\\"New York,\\\" and the habit of masculine solidarity made him\\naccept their doctrine on all the issues called moral.  He instinctively\\nfelt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad\\nform--to strike out for himself.\\n\\n\\\"Well--upon my soul!\\\" exclaimed Lawrence Lefferts, turning his\\nopera-glass abruptly away from the stage.  Lawrence Lefferts was, on\\nthe whole, the foremost authority on \\\"form\\\" in New York.  He had\\nprobably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this\\nintricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not account\\nfor his complete and easy competence.  One had only to look at him,\\nfrom the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair\\nmoustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean\\nand elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of \\\"form\\\" must be\\ncongenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so\\ncarelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace.  As a\\nyoung admirer had once said of him:  \\\"If anybody can tell a fellow just\\nwhen to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to, it's\\nLarry Lefferts.\\\"  And on the question of pumps versus patent-leather\\n\\\"Oxfords\\\" his authority had never been disputed.\\n\\n\\\"My God!\\\" he said; and silently handed his glass to old Sillerton\\nJackson.\\n\\nNewland Archer, following Lefferts's glance, saw with surprise that his\\nexclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old\\nMrs. Mingott's box.  It was that of a slim young woman, a little less\\ntall than May Welland, with brown hair growing in close curls about her\\ntemples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds.  The suggestion\\nof this headdress, which gave her what was then called a \\\"Josephine\\nlook,\\\" was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather\\ntheatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large\\nold-fashioned clasp.  The wearer of this unusual dress, who seemed\\nquite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment in\\nthe centre of the box, discussing with Mrs. Welland the propriety of\\ntaking the latter's place in the front right-hand corner; then she\\nyielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with Mrs.\\nWelland's sister-in-law, Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who was installed in the\\nopposite corner.\\n\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson had returned the opera-glass to Lawrence\\nLefferts.  The whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hear\\nwhat the old man had to say; for old Mr. Jackson was as great an\\nauthority on \\\"family\\\" as Lawrence Lefferts was on \\\"form.\\\"  He knew all\\nthe ramifications of New York's cousinships; and could not only\\nelucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between\\nthe Mingotts (through the Thorleys) with the Dallases of South\\nCarolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch of\\nPhiladelphia Thorleys to the Albany Chiverses (on no account to be\\nconfused with the Manson Chiverses of University Place), but could also\\nenumerate the leading characteristics of each family: as, for instance,\\nthe fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of Leffertses (the Long\\nIsland ones); or the fatal tendency of the Rushworths to make foolish\\nmatches; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the\\nAlbany Chiverses, with whom their New York cousins had always refused\\nto intermarry--with the disastrous exception of poor Medora Manson,\\nwho, as everybody knew ... but then her mother was a Rushworth.\\n\\nIn addition to this forest of family trees, Mr. Sillerton Jackson\\ncarried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch of\\nsilver hair, a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had\\nsmouldered under the unruffled surface of New York society within the\\nlast fifty years.  So far indeed did his information extend, and so\\nacutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the only\\nman who could have told you who Julius Beaufort, the banker, really\\nwas, and what had become of handsome Bob Spicer, old Mrs. Manson\\nMingott's father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sum\\nof trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very day\\nthat a beautiful Spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged\\naudiences in the old Opera-house on the Battery had taken ship for\\nCuba.  But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr.\\nJackson's breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\\nwhat he wanted to know.\\n\\nThe club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson handed back Lawrence Lefferts's opera-glass.  For a moment he\\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\\ntwist, and said simply:  \\\"I didn't think the Mingotts would have tried\\nit on.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNewland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a\\nstrange state of embarrassment.\\n\\nIt was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided\\nattention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothed\\nwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not\\nidentify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presence\\ncreated such excitement among the initiated.  Then light dawned on him,\\nand with it came a momentary rush of indignation.  No, indeed; no one\\nwould have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on!\\n\\nBut they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind\\nhim left no doubt in Archer's mind that the young woman was May\\nWelland's cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as \\\"poor\\nEllen Olenska.\\\"  Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe\\na day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not\\ndisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying\\nwith old Mrs. Mingott.  Archer entirely approved of family solidarity,\\nand one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their\\nresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock\\nhad produced.  There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man's\\nheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by\\nfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but\\nto receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing\\nfrom producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the\\nvery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer,\\nwas to be announced within a few weeks.  No, he felt as old Sillerton\\nJackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on!\\n\\nHe knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenue's\\nlimits) that old Mrs. Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, would\\ndare.  He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in\\nspite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with a\\nfather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough\\nto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the\\nwealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to \\\"foreigners\\\" (an\\nItalian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch to\\nher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone\\n(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in\\nthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park.\\n\\nOld Mrs. Mingott's foreign daughters had become a legend.  They never\\ncame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons\\nof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her\\nhabit, had philosophically remained at home.  But the cream-coloured\\nhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisian\\naristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she\\nthroned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the\\nTuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as\\nplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above\\nThirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened like\\ndoors instead of sashes that pushed up.\\n\\nEvery one (including Mr. Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that old\\nCatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York,\\njustified every success, and excused a certain number of failings.\\nUnkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won her\\nway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of\\nhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency\\nand dignity of her private life.  Mr. Manson Mingott had died when she\\nwas only twenty-eight, and had \\\"tied up\\\" the money with an additional\\ncaution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold young\\nwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,\\nmarried her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable\\ncircles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarly\\nwith Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend of\\nMme. Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first to\\nproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only\\nrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier\\nCatherine.\\n\\nMrs. Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband's\\nfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of\\nher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when\\nshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it\\nshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the\\ntransient pleasures of the table.  Therefore, for totally different\\nreasons, her food was as poor as Mrs. Archer's, and her wines did\\nnothing to redeem it.  Her relatives considered that the penury of her\\ntable discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associated\\nwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the\\n\\\"made dishes\\\" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of\\nher son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the\\nbest chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  \\\"What's the use of\\ntwo good cooks in one family, now that I've married the girls and can't\\neat sauces?\\\"\\n\\nNewland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his\\neyes toward the Mingott box.  He saw that Mrs. Welland and her\\nsister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the\\nMingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,\\nand that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due\\nto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of\\nthe situation.  As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully\\nin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,\\nas she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New York\\nwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for\\nwishing to pass unnoticed.\\n\\nFew things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against\\n\\\"Taste,\\\" that far-off divinity of whom \\\"Form\\\" was the mere visible\\nrepresentative and vicegerent.  Madame Olenska's pale and serious face\\nappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy\\nsituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from\\nher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him.  He hated to think of May\\nWelland's being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless\\nof the dictates of Taste.\\n\\n\\\"After all,\\\" he heard one of the younger men begin behind him\\n(everybody talked through the Mephistopheles-and-Martha scenes), \\\"after\\nall, just WHAT happened?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's an awful brute, isn't he?\\\" continued the young enquirer, a candid\\nThorley, who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the lady's\\nchampion.\\n\\n\\\"The very worst; I knew him at Nice,\\\" said Lawrence Lefferts with\\nauthority.  \\\"A half-paralysed white sneering fellow--rather handsome\\nhead, but eyes with a lot of lashes.  Well, I'll tell you the sort:\\nwhen he wasn't with women he was collecting china.  Paying any price\\nfor both, I understand.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a general laugh, and the young champion said:  \\\"Well,\\nthen----?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then; she bolted with his secretary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I see.\\\"  The champion's face fell.\\n\\n\\\"It didn't last long, though: I heard of her a few months later living\\nalone in Venice.  I believe Lovell Mingott went out to get her.  He\\nsaid she was desperately unhappy.  That's all right--but this parading\\nher at the Opera's another thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps,\\\" young Thorley hazarded, \\\"she's too unhappy to be left at\\nhome.\\\"\\n\\nThis was greeted with an irreverent laugh, and the youth blushed\\ndeeply, and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowing\\npeople called a \\\"double entendre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--it's queer to have brought Miss Welland, anyhow,\\\" some one said\\nin a low tone, with a side-glance at Archer.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that's part of the campaign: Granny's orders, no doubt,\\\" Lefferts\\nlaughed.  \\\"When the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly.\\\"\\n\\nThe act was ending, and there was a general stir in the box.  Suddenly\\nNewland Archer felt himself impelled to decisive action.  The desire to\\nbe the first man to enter Mrs. Mingott's box, to proclaim to the\\nwaiting world his engagement to May Welland, and to see her through\\nwhatever difficulties her cousin's anomalous situation might involve\\nher in; this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples and\\nhesitations, and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to the\\nfarther side of the house.\\n\\nAs he entered the box his eyes met Miss Welland's, and he saw that she\\nhad instantly understood his motive, though the family dignity which\\nboth considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so.\\nThe persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications\\nand pale delicacies, and the fact that he and she understood each other\\nwithout a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than any\\nexplanation would have done.  Her eyes said:  \\\"You see why Mamma\\nbrought me,\\\" and his answered:  \\\"I would not for the world have had you\\nstay away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know my niece Countess Olenska?\\\" Mrs. Welland enquired as she\\nshook hands with her future son-in-law.  Archer bowed without extending\\nhis hand, as was the custom on being introduced to a lady; and Ellen\\nOlenska bent her head slightly, keeping her own pale-gloved hands\\nclasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers.  Having greeted Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott, a large blonde lady in creaking satin, he sat down beside his\\nbetrothed, and said in a low tone:  \\\"I hope you've told Madame Olenska\\nthat we're engaged?  I want everybody to know--I want you to let me\\nannounce it this evening at the ball.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Welland's face grew rosy as the dawn, and she looked at him with\\nradiant eyes.  \\\"If you can persuade Mamma,\\\" she said; \\\"but why should\\nwe change what is already settled?\\\"  He made no answer but that which\\nhis eyes returned, and she added, still more confidently smiling:\\n\\\"Tell my cousin yourself: I give you leave.  She says she used to play\\nwith you when you were children.\\\"\\n\\nShe made way for him by pushing back her chair, and promptly, and a\\nlittle ostentatiously, with the desire that the whole house should see\\nwhat he was doing, Archer seated himself at the Countess Olenska's side.\\n\\n\\\"We DID use to play together, didn't we?\\\" she asked, turning her grave\\neyes to his.  \\\"You were a horrid boy, and kissed me once behind a door;\\nbut it was your cousin Vandie Newland, who never looked at me, that I\\nwas in love with.\\\"  Her glance swept the horse-shoe curve of boxes.\\n\\\"Ah, how this brings it all back to me--I see everybody here in\\nknickerbockers and pantalettes,\\\" she said, with her trailing slightly\\nforeign accent, her eyes returning to his face.\\n\\nAgreeable as their expression was, the young man was shocked that they\\nshould reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal before\\nwhich, at that very moment, her case was being tried.  Nothing could be\\nin worse taste than misplaced flippancy; and he answered somewhat\\nstiffly:  \\\"Yes, you have been away a very long time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, centuries and centuries; so long,\\\" she said, \\\"that I'm sure I'm\\ndead and buried, and this dear old place is heaven;\\\" which, for reasons\\nhe could not define, struck Newland Archer as an even more\\ndisrespectful way of describing New York society.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt invariably happened in the same way.\\n\\nMrs. Julius Beaufort, on the night of her annual ball, never failed to\\nappear at the Opera; indeed, she always gave her ball on an Opera night\\nin order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares, and\\nher possession of a staff of servants competent to organise every\\ndetail of the entertainment in her absence.\\n\\nThe Beauforts' house was one of the few in New York that possessed a\\nball-room (it antedated even Mrs. Manson Mingott's and the Headly\\nChiverses'); and at a time when it was beginning to be thought\\n\\\"provincial\\\" to put a \\\"crash\\\" over the drawing-room floor and move the\\nfurniture upstairs, the possession of a ball-room that was used for no\\nother purpose, and left for three-hundred-and-sixty-four days of the\\nyear to shuttered darkness, with its gilt chairs stacked in a corner\\nand its chandelier in a bag; this undoubted superiority was felt to\\ncompensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past.\\n\\nMrs. Archer, who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms,\\nhad once said:  \\\"We all have our pet common people--\\\" and though the\\nphrase was a daring one, its truth was secretly admitted in many an\\nexclusive bosom.  But the Beauforts were not exactly common; some\\npeople said they were even worse.  Mrs. Beaufort belonged indeed to one\\nof America's most honoured families; she had been the lovely Regina\\nDallas (of the South Carolina branch), a penniless beauty introduced to\\nNew York society by her cousin, the imprudent Medora Manson, who was\\nalways doing the wrong thing from the right motive.  When one was\\nrelated to the Mansons and the Rushworths one had a \\\"droit de cite\\\" (as\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson, who had frequented the Tuileries, called it) in\\nNew York society; but did one not forfeit it in marrying Julius\\nBeaufort?\\n\\nThe question was: who was Beaufort?  He passed for an Englishman, was\\nagreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty.  He had come\\nto America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs. Manson\\nMingott's English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself\\nan important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were\\ndissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and\\nwhen Medora Manson announced her cousin's engagement to him it was felt\\nto be one more act of folly in poor Medora's long record of imprudences.\\n\\nBut folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two\\nyears after young Mrs. Beaufort's marriage it was admitted that she had\\nthe most distinguished house in New York.  No one knew exactly how the\\nmiracle was accomplished.  She was indolent, passive, the caustic even\\ncalled her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing\\nyounger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr.\\nBeaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there\\nwithout lifting her jewelled little finger.  The knowing people said it\\nwas Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new\\ndishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the\\ndinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the\\nafter-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her\\nfriends.  If he did, these domestic activities were privately\\nperformed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless\\nand hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the\\ndetachment of an invited guest, and saying:  \\\"My wife's gloxinias are a\\nmarvel, aren't they?  I believe she gets them out from Kew.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Beaufort's secret, people were agreed, was the way he carried\\nthings off.  It was all very well to whisper that he had been \\\"helped\\\"\\nto leave England by the international banking-house in which he had\\nbeen employed; he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest--though\\nNew York's business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral\\nstandard--he carried everything before him, and all New York into his\\ndrawing-rooms, and for over twenty years now people had said they were\\n\\\"going to the Beauforts'\\\" with the same tone of security as if they had\\nsaid they were going to Mrs. Manson Mingott's, and with the added\\nsatisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas-back ducks and\\nvintage wines, instead of tepid Veuve Clicquot without a year and\\nwarmed-up croquettes from Philadelphia.\\n\\nMrs. Beaufort, then, had as usual appeared in her box just before the\\nJewel Song; and when, again as usual, she rose at the end of the third\\nact, drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders, and disappeared,\\nNew York knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin.\\n\\nThe Beaufort house was one that New Yorkers were proud to show to\\nforeigners, especially on the night of the annual ball.  The Beauforts\\nhad been among the first people in New York to own their own red velvet\\ncarpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen, under\\ntheir own awning, instead of hiring it with the supper and the\\nball-room chairs.  They had also inaugurated the custom of letting the\\nladies take their cloaks off in the hall, instead of shuffling up to\\nthe hostess's bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the\\ngas-burner; Beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all\\nhis wife's friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly\\ncoiffees when they left home.\\n\\nThen the house had been boldly planned with a ball-room, so that,\\ninstead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it (as at the\\nChiverses') one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed\\ndrawing-rooms (the sea-green, the crimson and the bouton d'or), seeing\\nfrom afar the many-candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry,\\nand beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and\\ntree-ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold\\nbamboo.\\n\\nNewland Archer, as became a young man of his position, strolled in\\nsomewhat late.  He had left his overcoat with the silk-stockinged\\nfootmen (the stockings were one of Beaufort's few fatuities), had\\ndawdled a while in the library hung with Spanish leather and furnished\\nwith Buhl and malachite, where a few men were chatting and putting on\\ntheir dancing-gloves, and had finally joined the line of guests whom\\nMrs. Beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nArcher was distinctly nervous.  He had not gone back to his club after\\nthe Opera (as the young bloods usually did), but, the night being fine,\\nhad walked for some distance up Fifth Avenue before turning back in the\\ndirection of the Beauforts' house.  He was definitely afraid that the\\nMingotts might be going too far; that, in fact, they might have Granny\\nMingott's orders to bring the Countess Olenska to the ball.\\n\\nFrom the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that\\nwould be; and, though he was more than ever determined to \\\"see the\\nthing through,\\\" he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his\\nbetrothed's cousin than before their brief talk at the Opera.\\n\\nWandering on to the bouton d'or drawing-room (where Beaufort had had\\nthe audacity to hang \\\"Love Victorious,\\\" the much-discussed nude of\\nBouguereau) Archer found Mrs. Welland and her daughter standing near\\nthe ball-room door.  Couples were already gliding over the floor\\nbeyond: the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts, on\\ngirlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms, on the dashing aigrettes\\nand ornaments of the young married women's coiffures, and on the\\nglitter of highly glazed shirt-fronts and fresh glace gloves.\\n\\nMiss Welland, evidently about to join the dancers, hung on the\\nthreshold, her lilies-of-the-valley in her hand (she carried no other\\nbouquet), her face a little pale, her eyes burning with a candid\\nexcitement.  A group of young men and girls were gathered about her,\\nand there was much hand-clasping, laughing and pleasantry on which Mrs.\\nWelland, standing slightly apart, shed the beam of a qualified\\napproval.  It was evident that Miss Welland was in the act of\\nannouncing her engagement, while her mother affected the air of\\nparental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion.\\n\\nArcher paused a moment.  It was at his express wish that the\\nannouncement had been made, and yet it was not thus that he would have\\nwished to have his happiness known.  To proclaim it in the heat and\\nnoise of a crowded ball-room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy\\nwhich should belong to things nearest the heart.  His joy was so deep\\nthat this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched; but he\\nwould have liked to keep the surface pure too.  It was something of a\\nsatisfaction to find that May Welland shared this feeling.  Her eyes\\nfled to his beseechingly, and their look said:  \\\"Remember, we're doing\\nthis because it's right.\\\"\\n\\nNo appeal could have found a more immediate response in Archer's\\nbreast; but he wished that the necessity of their action had been\\nrepresented by some ideal reason, and not simply by poor Ellen Olenska.\\nThe group about Miss Welland made way for him with significant smiles,\\nand after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed\\ninto the middle of the ball-room floor and put his arm about her waist.\\n\\n\\\"Now we shan't have to talk,\\\" he said, smiling into her candid eyes, as\\nthey floated away on the soft waves of the Blue Danube.\\n\\nShe made no answer.  Her lips trembled into a smile, but the eyes\\nremained distant and serious, as if bent on some ineffable vision.\\n\\\"Dear,\\\" Archer whispered, pressing her to him: it was borne in on him\\nthat the first hours of being engaged, even if spent in a ball-room,\\nhad in them something grave and sacramental.  What a new life it was\\ngoing to be, with this whiteness, radiance, goodness at one's side!\\n\\nThe dance over, the two, as became an affianced couple, wandered into\\nthe conservatory; and sitting behind a tall screen of tree-ferns and\\ncamellias Newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips.\\n\\n\\\"You see I did as you asked me to,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Yes: I couldn't wait,\\\" he answered smiling.  After a moment he added:\\n\\\"Only I wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know.\\\"  She met his glance comprehendingly.  \\\"But after\\nall--even here we're alone together, aren't we?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dearest--always!\\\" Archer cried.\\n\\nEvidently she was always going to understand; she was always going to\\nsay the right thing.  The discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow,\\nand he went on gaily:  \\\"The worst of it is that I want to kiss you and\\nI can't.\\\"  As he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory,\\nassured himself of their momentary privacy, and catching her to him\\nlaid a fugitive pressure on her lips.  To counteract the audacity of\\nthis proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of\\nthe conservatory, and sitting down beside her broke a\\nlily-of-the-valley from her bouquet.  She sat silent, and the world lay\\nlike a sunlit valley at their feet.\\n\\n\\\"Did you tell my cousin Ellen?\\\" she asked presently, as if she spoke\\nthrough a dream.\\n\\nHe roused himself, and remembered that he had not done so.  Some\\ninvincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign\\nwoman had checked the words on his lips.\\n\\n\\\"No--I hadn't the chance after all,\\\" he said, fibbing hastily.\\n\\n\\\"Ah.\\\"  She looked disappointed, but gently resolved on gaining her\\npoint.  \\\"You must, then, for I didn't either; and I shouldn't like her\\nto think--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not.  But aren't you, after all, the person to do it?\\\"\\n\\nShe pondered on this.  \\\"If I'd done it at the right time, yes: but now\\nthat there's been a delay I think you must explain that I'd asked you\\nto tell her at the Opera, before our speaking about it to everybody\\nhere.  Otherwise she might think I had forgotten her.  You see, she's\\none of the family, and she's been away so long that she's\\nrather--sensitive.\\\"\\n\\nArcher looked at her glowingly.  \\\"Dear and great angel!  Of course I'll\\ntell her.\\\"  He glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded\\nball-room.  \\\"But I haven't seen her yet.  Has she come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; at the last minute she decided not to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the last minute?\\\" he echoed, betraying his surprise that she should\\never have considered the alternative possible.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.  She's awfully fond of dancing,\\\" the young girl answered simply.\\n\\\"But suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn't smart enough\\nfor a ball, though we thought it so lovely; and so my aunt had to take\\nher home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well--\\\" said Archer with happy indifference.  Nothing about his\\nbetrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to\\nits utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the \\\"unpleasant\\\" in which they\\nhad both been brought up.\\n\\n\\\"She knows as well as I do,\\\" he reflected, \\\"the real reason of her\\ncousin's staying away; but I shall never let her see by the least sign\\nthat I am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor Ellen\\nOlenska's reputation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits\\nwere exchanged.  The New York ritual was precise and inflexible in such\\nmatters; and in conformity with it Newland Archer first went with his\\nmother and sister to call on Mrs. Welland, after which he and Mrs.\\nWelland and May drove out to old Mrs. Manson Mingott's to receive that\\nvenerable ancestress's blessing.\\n\\nA visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott was always an amusing episode to the\\nyoung man.  The house in itself was already an historic document,\\nthough not, of course, as venerable as certain other old family houses\\nin University Place and lower Fifth Avenue.  Those were of the purest\\n1830, with a grim harmony of cabbage-rose-garlanded carpets, rosewood\\nconsoles, round-arched fire-places with black marble mantels, and\\nimmense glazed book-cases of mahogany; whereas old Mrs. Mingott, who\\nhad built her house later, had bodily cast out the massive furniture of\\nher prime, and mingled with the Mingott heirlooms the frivolous\\nupholstery of the Second Empire.  It was her habit to sit in a window\\nof her sitting-room on the ground floor, as if watching calmly for life\\nand fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors.  She seemed in no\\nhurry to have them come, for her patience was equalled by her\\nconfidence.  She was sure that presently the hoardings, the quarries,\\nthe one-story saloons, the wooden green-houses in ragged gardens, and\\nthe rocks from which goats surveyed the scene, would vanish before the\\nadvance of residences as stately as her own--perhaps (for she was an\\nimpartial woman) even statelier; and that the cobble-stones over which\\nthe old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth\\nasphalt, such as people reported having seen in Paris.  Meanwhile, as\\nevery one she cared to see came to HER (and she could fill her rooms as\\neasily as the Beauforts, and without adding a single item to the menu\\nof her suppers), she did not suffer from her geographic isolation.\\n\\nThe immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle\\nlife like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump\\nactive little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into something\\nas vast and august as a natural phenomenon.  She had accepted this\\nsubmergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in\\nextreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost\\nunwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the centre of which\\nthe traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation.  A\\nflight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a\\nstill-snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a\\nminiature portrait of the late Mr. Mingott; and around and below, wave\\nafter wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious\\narmchair, with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of\\nthe billows.\\n\\nThe burden of Mrs. Manson Mingott's flesh had long since made it\\nimpossible for her to go up and down stairs, and with characteristic\\nindependence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established\\nherself (in flagrant violation of all the New York proprieties) on the\\nground floor of her house; so that, as you sat in her sitting-room\\nwindow with her, you caught (through a door that was always open, and a\\nlooped-back yellow damask portiere) the unexpected vista of a bedroom\\nwith a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa, and a toilet-table with\\nfrivolous lace flounces and a gilt-framed mirror.\\n\\nHer visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this\\narrangement, which recalled scenes in French fiction, and architectural\\nincentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamed\\nof.  That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies,\\nin apartments with all the rooms on one floor, and all the indecent\\npropinquities that their novels described.  It amused Newland Archer\\n(who had secretly situated the love-scenes of \\\"Monsieur de Camors\\\" in\\nMrs. Mingott's bedroom) to picture her blameless life led in the\\nstage-setting of adultery; but he said to himself, with considerable\\nadmiration, that if a lover had been what she wanted, the intrepid\\nwoman would have had him too.\\n\\nTo the general relief the Countess Olenska was not present in her\\ngrandmother's drawing-room during the visit of the betrothed couple.\\nMrs. Mingott said she had gone out; which, on a day of such glaring\\nsunlight, and at the \\\"shopping hour,\\\" seemed in itself an indelicate\\nthing for a compromised woman to do.  But at any rate it spared them\\nthe embarrassment of her presence, and the faint shadow that her\\nunhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future.  The visit\\nwent off successfully, as was to have been expected.  Old Mrs. Mingott\\nwas delighted with the engagement, which, being long foreseen by\\nwatchful relatives, had been carefully passed upon in family council;\\nand the engagement ring, a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws,\\nmet with her unqualified admiration.\\n\\n\\\"It's the new setting: of course it shows the stone beautifully, but it\\nlooks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes,\\\" Mrs. Welland had explained,\\nwith a conciliatory side-glance at her future son-in-law.\\n\\n\\\"Old-fashioned eyes?  I hope you don't mean mine, my dear?  I like all\\nthe novelties,\\\" said the ancestress, lifting the stone to her small\\nbright orbs, which no glasses had ever disfigured.  \\\"Very handsome,\\\"\\nshe added, returning the jewel; \\\"very liberal.  In my time a cameo set\\nin pearls was thought sufficient.  But it's the hand that sets off the\\nring, isn't it, my dear Mr. Archer?\\\" and she waved one of her tiny\\nhands, with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the\\nwrist like ivory bracelets.  \\\"Mine was modelled in Rome by the great\\nFerrigiani.  You should have May's done: no doubt he'll have it done,\\nmy child.  Her hand is large--it's these modern sports that spread the\\njoints--but the skin is white.--And when's the wedding to be?\\\" she\\nbroke off, fixing her eyes on Archer's face.\\n\\n\\\"Oh--\\\" Mrs. Welland murmured, while the young man, smiling at his\\nbetrothed, replied:  \\\"As soon as ever it can, if only you'll back me\\nup, Mrs. Mingott.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must give them time to get to know each other a little better,\\nmamma,\\\" Mrs. Welland interposed, with the proper affectation of\\nreluctance; to which the ancestress rejoined:  \\\"Know each other?\\nFiddlesticks!  Everybody in New York has always known everybody.  Let\\nthe young man have his way, my dear; don't wait till the bubble's off\\nthe wine.  Marry them before Lent; I may catch pneumonia any winter\\nnow, and I want to give the wedding-breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nThese successive statements were received with the proper expressions\\nof amusement, incredulity and gratitude; and the visit was breaking up\\nin a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the Countess\\nOlenska, who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected\\nfigure of Julius Beaufort.\\n\\nThere was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies, and Mrs.\\nMingott held out Ferrigiani's model to the banker.  \\\"Ha!  Beaufort,\\nthis is a rare favour!\\\" (She had an odd foreign way of addressing men\\nby their surnames.)\\n\\n\\\"Thanks.  I wish it might happen oftener,\\\" said the visitor in his easy\\narrogant way.  \\\"I'm generally so tied down; but I met the Countess\\nEllen in Madison Square, and she was good enough to let me walk home\\nwith her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--I hope the house will be gayer, now that Ellen's here!\\\" cried Mrs.\\nMingott with a glorious effrontery.  \\\"Sit down--sit down, Beaufort:\\npush up the yellow armchair; now I've got you I want a good gossip.  I\\nhear your ball was magnificent; and I understand you invited Mrs.\\nLemuel Struthers?  Well--I've a curiosity to see the woman myself.\\\"\\n\\nShe had forgotten her relatives, who were drifting out into the hall\\nunder Ellen Olenska's guidance.  Old Mrs. Mingott had always professed\\na great admiration for Julius Beaufort, and there was a kind of kinship\\nin their cool domineering way and their short-cuts through the\\nconventions.  Now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the\\nBeauforts to invite (for the first time) Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, the\\nwidow of Struthers's Shoe-polish, who had returned the previous year\\nfrom a long initiatory sojourn in Europe to lay siege to the tight\\nlittle citadel of New York.  \\\"Of course if you and Regina invite her\\nthe thing is settled.  Well, we need new blood and new money--and I\\nhear she's still very good-looking,\\\" the carnivorous old lady declared.\\n\\nIn the hall, while Mrs. Welland and May drew on their furs, Archer saw\\nthat the Countess Olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning\\nsmile.\\n\\n\\\"Of course you know already--about May and me,\\\" he said, answering her\\nlook with a shy laugh.  \\\"She scolded me for not giving you the news\\nlast night at the Opera: I had her orders to tell you that we were\\nengaged--but I couldn't, in that crowd.\\\"\\n\\nThe smile passed from Countess Olenska's eyes to her lips: she looked\\nyounger, more like the bold brown Ellen Mingott of his boyhood.  \\\"Of\\ncourse I know; yes.  And I'm so glad.  But one doesn't tell such things\\nfirst in a crowd.\\\"  The ladies were on the threshold and she held out\\nher hand.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye; come and see me some day,\\\" she said, still looking at Archer.\\n\\nIn the carriage, on the way down Fifth Avenue, they talked pointedly of\\nMrs. Mingott, of her age, her spirit, and all her wonderful attributes.\\nNo one alluded to Ellen Olenska; but Archer knew that Mrs. Welland was\\nthinking:  \\\"It's a mistake for Ellen to be seen, the very day after her\\narrival, parading up Fifth Avenue at the crowded hour with Julius\\nBeaufort--\\\" and the young man himself mentally added:  \\\"And she ought\\nto know that a man who's just engaged doesn't spend his time calling on\\nmarried women.  But I daresay in the set she's lived in they do--they\\nnever do anything else.\\\" And, in spite of the cosmopolitan views on\\nwhich he prided himself, he thanked heaven that he was a New Yorker,\\nand about to ally himself with one of his own kind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next evening old Mr. Sillerton Jackson came to dine with the\\nArchers.\\n\\nMrs. Archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked to\\nbe well-informed as to its doings.  Her old friend Mr. Sillerton\\nJackson applied to the investigation of his friends' affairs the\\npatience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and his\\nsister, Miss Sophy Jackson, who lived with him, and was entertained by\\nall the people who could not secure her much-sought-after brother,\\nbrought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in\\nhis picture.\\n\\nTherefore, whenever anything happened that Mrs. Archer wanted to know\\nabout, she asked Mr. Jackson to dine; and as she honoured few people\\nwith her invitations, and as she and her daughter Janey were an\\nexcellent audience, Mr. Jackson usually came himself instead of sending\\nhis sister.  If he could have dictated all the conditions, he would\\nhave chosen the evenings when Newland was out; not because the young\\nman was uncongenial to him (the two got on capitally at their club) but\\nbecause the old anecdotist sometimes felt, on Newland's part, a\\ntendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never\\nshowed.\\n\\nMr. Jackson, if perfection had been attainable on earth, would also\\nhave asked that Mrs. Archer's food should be a little better.  But then\\nNew York, as far back as the mind of man could travel, had been divided\\ninto the two great fundamental groups of the Mingotts and Mansons and\\nall their clan, who cared about eating and clothes and money, and the\\nArcher-Newland-van-der-Luyden tribe, who were devoted to travel,\\nhorticulture and the best fiction, and looked down on the grosser forms\\nof pleasure.\\n\\nYou couldn't have everything, after all.  If you dined with the Lovell\\nMingotts you got canvas-back and terrapin and vintage wines; at Adeline\\nArcher's you could talk about Alpine scenery and \\\"The Marble Faun\\\"; and\\nluckily the Archer Madeira had gone round the Cape.  Therefore when a\\nfriendly summons came from Mrs. Archer, Mr. Jackson, who was a true\\neclectic, would usually say to his sister:  \\\"I've been a little gouty\\nsince my last dinner at the Lovell Mingotts'--it will do me good to\\ndiet at Adeline's.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer, who had long been a widow, lived with her son and daughter\\nin West Twenty-eighth Street.  An upper floor was dedicated to Newland,\\nand the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below.  In\\nan unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in\\nWardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen,\\ncollected American revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to \\\"Good\\nWords,\\\" and read Ouida's novels for the sake of the Italian atmosphere.\\n(They preferred those about peasant life, because of the descriptions\\nof scenery and the pleasanter sentiments, though in general they liked\\nnovels about people in society, whose motives and habits were more\\ncomprehensible, spoke severely of Dickens, who \\\"had never drawn a\\ngentleman,\\\" and considered Thackeray less at home in the great world\\nthan Bulwer--who, however, was beginning to be thought old-fashioned.)\\nMrs. and Miss Archer were both great lovers of scenery.  It was what\\nthey principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad;\\nconsidering architecture and painting as subjects for men, and chiefly\\nfor learned persons who read Ruskin.  Mrs. Archer had been born a\\nNewland, and mother and daughter, who were as like as sisters, were\\nboth, as people said, \\\"true Newlands\\\"; tall, pale, and slightly\\nround-shouldered, with long noses, sweet smiles and a kind of drooping\\ndistinction like that in certain faded Reynolds portraits.  Their\\nphysical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint\\nhad not stretched Mrs. Archer's black brocade, while Miss Archer's\\nbrown and purple poplins hung, as the years went on, more and more\\nslackly on her virgin frame.\\n\\nMentally, the likeness between them, as Newland was aware, was less\\ncomplete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear.  The\\nlong habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given\\nthem the same vocabulary, and the same habit of beginning their phrases\\n\\\"Mother thinks\\\" or \\\"Janey thinks,\\\" according as one or the other wished\\nto advance an opinion of her own; but in reality, while Mrs. Archer's\\nserene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar,\\nJaney was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from\\nsprings of suppressed romance.\\n\\nMother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and\\nbrother; and Archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and\\nuncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration, and by his\\nsecret satisfaction in it.  After all, he thought it a good thing for a\\nman to have his authority respected in his own house, even if his sense\\nof humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate.\\n\\nOn this occasion the young man was very sure that Mr. Jackson would\\nrather have had him dine out; but he had his own reasons for not doing\\nso.\\n\\nOf course old Jackson wanted to talk about Ellen Olenska, and of course\\nMrs. Archer and Janey wanted to hear what he had to tell.  All three\\nwould be slightly embarrassed by Newland's presence, now that his\\nprospective relation to the Mingott clan had been made known; and the\\nyoung man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn\\nthe difficulty.\\n\\nThey began, obliquely, by talking about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers.\\n\\n\\\"It's a pity the Beauforts asked her,\\\" Mrs. Archer said gently.  \\\"But\\nthen Regina always does what he tells her; and BEAUFORT--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certain nuances escape Beaufort,\\\" said Mr. Jackson, cautiously\\ninspecting the broiled shad, and wondering for the thousandth time why\\nMrs. Archer's cook always burnt the roe to a cinder. (Newland, who had\\nlong shared his wonder, could always detect it in the older man's\\nexpression of melancholy disapproval.)\\n\\n\\\"Oh, necessarily; Beaufort is a vulgar man,\\\" said Mrs. Archer.  \\\"My\\ngrandfather Newland always used to say to my mother:  'Whatever you do,\\ndon't let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls.'  But at\\nleast he's had the advantage of associating with gentlemen; in England\\ntoo, they say.  It's all very mysterious--\\\" She glanced at Janey and\\npaused.  She and Janey knew every fold of the Beaufort mystery, but in\\npublic Mrs. Archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for\\nthe unmarried.\\n\\n\\\"But this Mrs. Struthers,\\\" Mrs. Archer continued; \\\"what did you say SHE\\nwas, Sillerton?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Out of a mine: or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit.\\nThen with Living Wax-Works, touring New England.  After the police\\nbroke THAT up, they say she lived--\\\"  Mr. Jackson in his turn glanced\\nat Janey, whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids.\\nThere were still hiatuses for her in Mrs. Struthers's past.\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" Mr. Jackson continued (and Archer saw he was wondering why no\\none had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife),\\n\\\"then Lemuel Struthers came along.  They say his advertiser used the\\ngirl's head for the shoe-polish posters; her hair's intensely black,\\nyou know--the Egyptian style.  Anyhow, he--eventually--married her.\\\"\\nThere were volumes of innuendo in the way the \\\"eventually\\\" was spaced,\\nand each syllable given its due stress.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well--at the pass we've come to nowadays, it doesn't matter,\\\" said\\nMrs. Archer indifferently.  The ladies were not really interested in\\nMrs. Struthers just then; the subject of Ellen Olenska was too fresh\\nand too absorbing to them.  Indeed, Mrs. Struthers's name had been\\nintroduced by Mrs. Archer only that she might presently be able to say:\\n\\\"And Newland's new cousin--Countess Olenska?  Was SHE at the ball too?\\\"\\n\\nThere was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son, and\\nArcher knew it and had expected it.  Even Mrs. Archer, who was seldom\\nunduly pleased with human events, had been altogether glad of her son's\\nengagement. (\\\"Especially after that silly business with Mrs.\\nRushworth,\\\" as she had remarked to Janey, alluding to what had once\\nseemed to Newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the\\nscar.)\\n\\nThere was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at the\\nquestion from whatever point you chose.  Of course such a marriage was\\nonly what Newland was entitled to; but young men are so foolish and\\nincalculable--and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous--that it was\\nnothing short of a miracle to see one's only son safe past the Siren\\nIsle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity.\\n\\nAll this Mrs. Archer felt, and her son knew she felt; but he knew also\\nthat she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his\\nengagement, or rather by its cause; and it was for that reason--because\\non the whole he was a tender and indulgent master--that he had stayed\\nat home that evening.  \\\"It's not that I don't approve of the Mingotts'\\nesprit de corps; but why Newland's engagement should be mixed up with\\nthat Olenska woman's comings and goings I don't see,\\\" Mrs. Archer\\ngrumbled to Janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect\\nsweetness.\\n\\nShe had behaved beautifully--and in beautiful behaviour she was\\nunsurpassed--during the call on Mrs. Welland; but Newland knew (and his\\nbetrothed doubtless guessed) that all through the visit she and Janey\\nwere nervously on the watch for Madame Olenska's possible intrusion;\\nand when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say\\nto her son:  \\\"I'm thankful that Augusta Welland received us alone.\\\"\\n\\nThese indications of inward disturbance moved Archer the more that he\\ntoo felt that the Mingotts had gone a little too far.  But, as it was\\nagainst all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever\\nallude to what was uppermost in their thoughts, he simply replied: \\\"Oh,\\nwell, there's always a phase of family parties to be gone through when\\none gets engaged, and the sooner it's over the better.\\\"  At which his\\nmother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from\\nher grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes.\\n\\nHer revenge, he felt--her lawful revenge--would be to \\\"draw\\\" Mr.\\nJackson that evening on the Countess Olenska; and, having publicly done\\nhis duty as a future member of the Mingott clan, the young man had no\\nobjection to hearing the lady discussed in private--except that the\\nsubject was already beginning to bore him.\\n\\nMr. Jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the\\nmournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own, and\\nhad rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff.  He\\nlooked baffled and hungry, and Archer reflected that he would probably\\nfinish his meal on Ellen Olenska.\\n\\nMr. Jackson leaned back in his chair, and glanced up at the candlelit\\nArchers, Newlands and van der Luydens hanging in dark frames on the\\ndark walls.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, how your grandfather Archer loved a good dinner, my dear Newland!\\\"\\nhe said, his eyes on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man in\\na stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-columned country-house\\nbehind him.  \\\"Well--well--well ... I wonder what he would have said to\\nall these foreign marriages!\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and Mr.\\nJackson continued with deliberation: \\\"No, she was NOT at the ball.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--\\\" Mrs. Archer murmured, in a tone that implied:  \\\"She had that\\ndecency.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps the Beauforts don't know her,\\\" Janey suggested, with her\\nartless malice.\\n\\nMr. Jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had been tasting invisible\\nMadeira.  \\\"Mrs. Beaufort may not--but Beaufort certainly does, for she\\nwas seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon with him by the whole\\nof New York.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mercy--\\\" moaned Mrs. Archer, evidently perceiving the uselessness of\\ntrying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon,\\\" Janey\\nspeculated.  \\\"At the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet,\\nperfectly plain and flat--like a night-gown.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Janey!\\\" said her mother; and Miss Archer blushed and tried to look\\naudacious.\\n\\n\\\"It was, at any rate, in better taste not to go to the ball,\\\" Mrs.\\nArcher continued.\\n\\nA spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin:  \\\"I don't think it was\\na question of taste with her.  May said she meant to go, and then\\ndecided that the dress in question wasn't smart enough.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference.  \\\"Poor\\nEllen,\\\" she simply remarked; adding compassionately:  \\\"We must always\\nbear in mind what an eccentric bringing-up Medora Manson gave her.\\nWhat can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at\\nher coming-out ball?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--don't I remember her in it!\\\" said Mr. Jackson; adding:  \\\"Poor\\ngirl!\\\" in the tone of one who, while enjoying the memory, had fully\\nunderstood at the time what the sight portended.\\n\\n\\\"It's odd,\\\" Janey remarked, \\\"that she should have kept such an ugly\\nname as Ellen.  I should have changed it to Elaine.\\\"  She glanced about\\nthe table to see the effect of this.\\n\\nHer brother laughed.  \\\"Why Elaine?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know; it sounds more--more Polish,\\\" said Janey, blushing.\\n\\n\\\"It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,\\\"\\nsaid Mrs. Archer distantly.\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative.  \\\"Why\\nshouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses?  Why should she slink\\nabout as if it were she who had disgraced herself?  She's 'poor Ellen'\\ncertainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;\\nbut I don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she were\\nthe culprit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That, I suppose,\\\" said Mr. Jackson, speculatively, \\\"is the line the\\nMingotts mean to take.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man reddened.  \\\"I didn't have to wait for their cue, if\\nthat's what you mean, sir.  Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life:\\nthat doesn't make her an outcast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There are rumours,\\\" began Mr. Jackson, glancing at Janey.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I know: the secretary,\\\" the young man took him up.  \\\"Nonsense,\\nmother; Janey's grown-up.  They say, don't they,\\\" he went on, \\\"that the\\nsecretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept\\nher practically a prisoner?  Well, what if he did?  I hope there isn't\\na man among us who wouldn't have done the same in such a case.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler:\\n\\\"Perhaps ... that sauce ... just a little, after all--\\\"; then, having\\nhelped himself, he remarked: \\\"I'm told she's looking for a house.  She\\nmeans to live here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hear she means to get a divorce,\\\" said Janey boldly.\\n\\n\\\"I hope she will!\\\" Archer exclaimed.\\n\\nThe word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil\\natmosphere of the Archer dining-room.  Mrs. Archer raised her delicate\\neye-brows in the particular curve that signified:  \\\"The butler--\\\" and\\nthe young man, himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such\\nintimate matters in public, hastily branched off into an account of his\\nvisit to old Mrs. Mingott.\\n\\nAfter dinner, according to immemorial custom, Mrs. Archer and Janey\\ntrailed their long silk draperies up to the drawing-room, where, while\\nthe gentlemen smoked below stairs, they sat beside a Carcel lamp with\\nan engraved globe, facing each other across a rosewood work-table with\\na green silk bag under it, and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry\\nband of field-flowers destined to adorn an \\\"occasional\\\" chair in the\\ndrawing-room of young Mrs. Newland Archer.\\n\\nWhile this rite was in progress in the drawing-room, Archer settled Mr.\\nJackson in an armchair near the fire in the Gothic library and handed\\nhim a cigar.  Mr. Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit\\nhis cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), and\\nstretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said:  \\\"You say the\\nsecretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow?  Well, he was\\nstill helping her a year later, then; for somebody met 'em living at\\nLausanne together.\\\"\\n\\nNewland reddened.  \\\"Living together?  Well, why not?  Who had the right\\nto make her life over if she hadn't?  I'm sick of the hypocrisy that\\nwould bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with\\nharlots.\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar.  \\\"Women ought to\\nbe free--as free as we are,\\\" he declared, making a discovery of which\\nhe was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.\\n\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted\\na sardonic whistle.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he said after a pause, \\\"apparently Count Olenski takes your\\nview; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife\\nback.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat evening, after Mr. Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies\\nhad retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mounted\\nthoughtfully to his own study.  A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the\\nfire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows\\nof books, its bronze and steel statuettes of \\\"The Fencers\\\" on the\\nmantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked\\nsingularly home-like and welcoming.\\n\\nAs he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a\\nlarge photograph of May Welland, which the young girl had given him in\\nthe first days of their romance, and which had now displaced all the\\nother portraits on the table.  With a new sense of awe he looked at the\\nfrank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young\\ncreature whose soul's custodian he was to be.  That terrifying product\\nof the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who\\nknew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like a\\nstranger through May Welland's familiar features; and once more it was\\nborne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been\\ntaught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas.\\n\\nThe case of the Countess Olenska had stirred up old settled convictions\\nand set them drifting dangerously through his mind.  His own\\nexclamation:  \\\"Women should be free--as free as we are,\\\" struck to the\\nroot of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as\\nnon-existent.  \\\"Nice\\\" women, however wronged, would never claim the\\nkind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were\\ntherefore--in the heat of argument--the more chivalrously ready to\\nconcede it to them.  Such verbal generosities were in fact only a\\nhumbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things\\ntogether and bound people down to the old pattern.  But here he was\\npledged to defend, on the part of his betrothed's cousin, conduct that,\\non his own wife's part, would justify him in calling down on her all\\nthe thunders of Church and State.  Of course the dilemma was purely\\nhypothetical; since he wasn't a blackguard Polish nobleman, it was\\nabsurd to speculate what his wife's rights would be if he WERE.  But\\nNewland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and\\nMay's, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable.\\nWhat could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty,\\nas a \\\"decent\\\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a\\nmarriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?  What if, for some one\\nof the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them, they should\\ntire of each other, misunderstand or irritate each other?  He reviewed\\nhis friends' marriages--the supposedly happy ones--and saw none that\\nanswered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which\\nhe pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland.  He perceived\\nthat such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the\\nversatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully\\ntrained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his\\nmarriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a\\ndull association of material and social interests held together by\\nignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.  Lawrence\\nLefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely\\nrealised this enviable ideal.  As became the high-priest of form, he\\nhad formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that, in the\\nmost conspicuous moments of his frequent love-affairs with other men's\\nwives, she went about in smiling unconsciousness, saying that \\\"Lawrence\\nwas so frightfully strict\\\"; and had been known to blush indignantly,\\nand avert her gaze, when some one alluded in her presence to the fact\\nthat Julius Beaufort (as became a \\\"foreigner\\\" of doubtful origin) had\\nwhat was known in New York as \\\"another establishment.\\\"\\n\\nArcher tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite\\nsuch an ass as Larry Lefferts, nor May such a simpleton as poor\\nGertrude; but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not\\nof standards.  In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic\\nworld, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but\\nonly represented by a set of arbitrary signs; as when Mrs. Welland, who\\nknew exactly why Archer had pressed her to announce her daughter's\\nengagement at the Beaufort ball (and had indeed expected him to do no\\nless), yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance, and the air of having\\nhad her hand forced, quite as, in the books on Primitive Man that\\npeople of advanced culture were beginning to read, the savage bride is\\ndragged with shrieks from her parents' tent.\\n\\nThe result, of course, was that the young girl who was the centre of\\nthis elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable\\nfor her very frankness and assurance.  She was frank, poor darling,\\nbecause she had nothing to conceal, assured because she knew of nothing\\nto be on her guard against; and with no better preparation than this,\\nshe was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called \\\"the\\nfacts of life.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man was sincerely but placidly in love.  He delighted in the\\nradiant good looks of his betrothed, in her health, her horsemanship,\\nher grace and quickness at games, and the shy interest in books and\\nideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance.  (She had\\nadvanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the Idyls of the King,\\nbut not to feel the beauty of Ulysses and the Lotus Eaters.) She was\\nstraightforward, loyal and brave; she had a sense of humour (chiefly\\nproved by her laughing at HIS jokes); and he suspected, in the depths\\nof her innocently-gazing soul, a glow of feeling that it would be a joy\\nto waken.  But when he had gone the brief round of her he returned\\ndiscouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were\\nonly an artificial product.  Untrained human nature was not frank and\\ninnocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive\\nguile.  And he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious\\npurity, so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts\\nand grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to\\nbe what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he might\\nexercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow.\\n\\nThere was a certain triteness in these reflections: they were those\\nhabitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day.  But they\\nwere generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and self-abasement\\nof which Newland Archer felt no trace.  He could not deplore (as\\nThackeray's heroes so often exasperated him by doing) that he had not a\\nblank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she\\nwas to give to him.  He could not get away from the fact that if he had\\nbeen brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find\\ntheir way about than the Babes in the Wood; nor could he, for all his\\nanxious cogitations, see any honest reason (any, that is, unconnected\\nwith his own momentary pleasure, and the passion of masculine vanity)\\nwhy his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of\\nexperience as himself.\\n\\nSuch questions, at such an hour, were bound to drift through his mind;\\nbut he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision\\nwere due to the inopportune arrival of the Countess Olenska.  Here he\\nwas, at the very moment of his betrothal--a moment for pure thoughts\\nand cloudless hopes--pitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised\\nall the special problems he would have preferred to let lie.  \\\"Hang\\nEllen Olenska!\\\" he grumbled, as he covered his fire and began to\\nundress.  He could not really see why her fate should have the least\\nbearing on his; yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to\\nmeasure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced\\nupon him.\\n\\n\\nA few days later the bolt fell.\\n\\nThe Lovell Mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as \\\"a formal\\ndinner\\\" (that is, three extra footmen, two dishes for each course, and\\na Roman punch in the middle), and had headed their invitations with the\\nwords \\\"To meet the Countess Olenska,\\\" in accordance with the hospitable\\nAmerican fashion, which treats strangers as if they were royalties, or\\nat least as their ambassadors.\\n\\nThe guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in\\nwhich the initiated recognised the firm hand of Catherine the Great.\\nAssociated with such immemorial standbys as the Selfridge Merrys, who\\nwere asked everywhere because they always had been, the Beauforts, on\\nwhom there was a claim of relationship, and Mr. Sillerton Jackson and\\nhis sister Sophy (who went wherever her brother told her to), were some\\nof the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant\\n\\\"young married\\\" set; the Lawrence Leffertses, Mrs. Lefferts Rushworth\\n(the lovely widow), the Harry Thorleys, the Reggie Chiverses and young\\nMorris Dagonet and his wife (who was a van der Luyden).  The company\\nindeed was perfectly assorted, since all the members belonged to the\\nlittle inner group of people who, during the long New York season,\\ndisported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently\\nundiminished zest.\\n\\nForty-eight hours later the unbelievable had happened; every one had\\nrefused the Mingotts' invitation except the Beauforts and old Mr.\\nJackson and his sister.  The intended slight was emphasised by the fact\\nthat even the Reggie Chiverses, who were of the Mingott clan, were\\namong those inflicting it; and by the uniform wording of the notes, in\\nall of which the writers \\\"regretted that they were unable to accept,\\\"\\nwithout the mitigating plea of a \\\"previous engagement\\\" that ordinary\\ncourtesy prescribed.\\n\\nNew York society was, in those days, far too small, and too scant in\\nits resources, for every one in it (including livery-stable-keepers,\\nbutlers and cooks) not to know exactly on which evenings people were\\nfree; and it was thus possible for the recipients of Mrs. Lovell\\nMingott's invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to\\nmeet the Countess Olenska.\\n\\nThe blow was unexpected; but the Mingotts, as their way was, met it\\ngallantly.  Mrs. Lovell Mingott confided the case to Mrs. Welland, who\\nconfided it to Newland Archer; who, aflame at the outrage, appealed\\npassionately and authoritatively to his mother; who, after a painful\\nperiod of inward resistance and outward temporising, succumbed to his\\ninstances (as she always did), and immediately embracing his cause with\\nan energy redoubled by her previous hesitations, put on her grey velvet\\nbonnet and said:  \\\"I'll go and see Louisa van der Luyden.\\\"\\n\\nThe New York of Newland Archer's day was a small and slippery pyramid,\\nin which, as yet, hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained.\\nAt its base was a firm foundation of what Mrs. Archer called \\\"plain\\npeople\\\"; an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who\\n(as in the case of the Spicers or the Leffertses or the Jacksons) had\\nbeen raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans.\\nPeople, Mrs. Archer always said, were not as particular as they used to\\nbe; and with old Catherine Spicer ruling one end of Fifth Avenue, and\\nJulius Beaufort the other, you couldn't expect the old traditions to\\nlast much longer.\\n\\nFirmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum\\nwas the compact and dominant group which the Mingotts, Newlands,\\nChiverses and Mansons so actively represented.  Most people imagined\\nthem to be the very apex of the pyramid; but they themselves (at least\\nthose of Mrs. Archer's generation) were aware that, in the eyes of the\\nprofessional genealogist, only a still smaller number of families could\\nlay claim to that eminence.\\n\\n\\\"Don't tell me,\\\" Mrs. Archer would say to her children, \\\"all this\\nmodern newspaper rubbish about a New York aristocracy.  If there is\\none, neither the Mingotts nor the Mansons belong to it; no, nor the\\nNewlands or the Chiverses either.  Our grandfathers and\\ngreat-grandfathers were just respectable English or Dutch merchants,\\nwho came to the colonies to make their fortune, and stayed here because\\nthey did so well.  One of your great-grandfathers signed the\\nDeclaration, and another was a general on Washington's staff, and\\nreceived General Burgoyne's sword after the battle of Saratoga.  These\\nare things to be proud of, but they have nothing to do with rank or\\nclass.  New York has always been a commercial community, and there are\\nnot more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin\\nin the real sense of the word.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer and her son and daughter, like every one else in New York,\\nknew who these privileged beings were: the Dagonets of Washington\\nSquare, who came of an old English county family allied with the Pitts\\nand Foxes; the Lannings, who had intermarried with the descendants of\\nCount de Grasse, and the van der Luydens, direct descendants of the\\nfirst Dutch governor of Manhattan, and related by pre-revolutionary\\nmarriages to several members of the French and British aristocracy.\\n\\nThe Lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively\\nMiss Lannings, who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family\\nportraits and Chippendale; the Dagonets were a considerable clan,\\nallied to the best names in Baltimore and Philadelphia; but the van der\\nLuydens, who stood above all of them, had faded into a kind of\\nsuper-terrestrial twilight, from which only two figures impressively\\nemerged; those of Mr. and Mrs. Henry van der Luyden.\\n\\nMrs. Henry van der Luyden had been Louisa Dagonet, and her mother had\\nbeen the granddaughter of Colonel du Lac, of an old Channel Island\\nfamily, who had fought under Cornwallis and had settled in Maryland,\\nafter the war, with his bride, Lady Angelica Trevenna, fifth daughter\\nof the Earl of St. Austrey.  The tie between the Dagonets, the du Lacs\\nof Maryland, and their aristocratic Cornish kinsfolk, the Trevennas,\\nhad always remained close and cordial.  Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had\\nmore than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of\\nTrevenna, the Duke of St.  Austrey, at his country-seat in Cornwall and\\nat St.  Austrey in Gloucestershire; and his Grace had frequently\\nannounced his intention of some day returning their visit (without the\\nDuchess, who feared the Atlantic).\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. van der Luyden divided their time between Trevenna, their\\nplace in Maryland, and Skuytercliff, the great estate on the Hudson\\nwhich had been one of the colonial grants of the Dutch government to\\nthe famous first Governor, and of which Mr. van der Luyden was still\\n\\\"Patroon.\\\"  Their large solemn house in Madison Avenue was seldom\\nopened, and when they came to town they received in it only their most\\nintimate friends.\\n\\n\\\"I wish you would go with me, Newland,\\\" his mother said, suddenly\\npausing at the door of the Brown coupe.  \\\"Louisa is fond of you; and of\\ncourse it's on account of dear May that I'm taking this step--and also\\nbecause, if we don't all stand together, there'll be no such thing as\\nSociety left.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Henry van der Luyden listened in silence to her cousin Mrs.\\nArcher's narrative.\\n\\nIt was all very well to tell yourself in advance that Mrs. van der\\nLuyden was always silent, and that, though non-committal by nature and\\ntraining, she was very kind to the people she really liked.  Even\\npersonal experience of these facts was not always a protection from the\\nchill that descended on one in the high-ceilinged white-walled Madison\\nAvenue drawing-room, with the pale brocaded armchairs so obviously\\nuncovered for the occasion, and the gauze still veiling the ormolu\\nmantel ornaments and the beautiful old carved frame of Gainsborough's\\n\\\"Lady Angelica du Lac.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. van der Luyden's portrait by Huntington (in black velvet and\\nVenetian point) faced that of her lovely ancestress.  It was generally\\nconsidered \\\"as fine as a Cabanel,\\\" and, though twenty years had elapsed\\nsince its execution, was still \\\"a perfect likeness.\\\" Indeed the Mrs.\\nvan der Luyden who sat beneath it listening to Mrs. Archer might have\\nbeen the twin-sister of the fair and still youngish woman drooping\\nagainst a gilt armchair before a green rep curtain.  Mrs. van der\\nLuyden still wore black velvet and Venetian point when she went into\\nsociety--or rather (since she never dined out) when she threw open her\\nown doors to receive it.  Her fair hair, which had faded without\\nturning grey, was still parted in flat overlapping points on her\\nforehead, and the straight nose that divided her pale blue eyes was\\nonly a little more pinched about the nostrils than when the portrait\\nhad been painted.  She always, indeed, struck Newland Archer as having\\nbeen rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a\\nperfectly irreproachable existence, as bodies caught in glaciers keep\\nfor years a rosy life-in-death.\\n\\nLike all his family, he esteemed and admired Mrs. van der Luyden; but\\nhe found her gentle bending sweetness less approachable than the\\ngrimness of some of his mother's old aunts, fierce spinsters who said\\n\\\"No\\\" on principle before they knew what they were going to be asked.\\n\\nMrs. van der Luyden's attitude said neither yes nor no, but always\\nappeared to incline to clemency till her thin lips, wavering into the\\nshadow of a smile, made the almost invariable reply:  \\\"I shall first\\nhave to talk this over with my husband.\\\"\\n\\nShe and Mr. van der Luyden were so exactly alike that Archer often\\nwondered how, after forty years of the closest conjugality, two such\\nmerged identities ever separated themselves enough for anything as\\ncontroversial as a talking-over.  But as neither had ever reached a\\ndecision without prefacing it by this mysterious conclave, Mrs. Archer\\nand her son, having set forth their case, waited resignedly for the\\nfamiliar phrase.\\n\\nMrs. van der Luyden, however, who had seldom surprised any one, now\\nsurprised them by reaching her long hand toward the bell-rope.\\n\\n\\\"I think,\\\" she said, \\\"I should like Henry to hear what you have told\\nme.\\\"\\n\\nA footman appeared, to whom she gravely added: \\\"If Mr. van der Luyden\\nhas finished reading the newspaper, please ask him to be kind enough to\\ncome.\\\"\\n\\nShe said \\\"reading the newspaper\\\" in the tone in which a Minister's wife\\nmight have said:  \\\"Presiding at a Cabinet meeting\\\"--not from any\\narrogance of mind, but because the habit of a life-time, and the\\nattitude of her friends and relations, had led her to consider Mr. van\\nder Luyden's least gesture as having an almost sacerdotal importance.\\n\\nHer promptness of action showed that she considered the case as\\npressing as Mrs. Archer; but, lest she should be thought to have\\ncommitted herself in advance, she added, with the sweetest look:\\n\\\"Henry always enjoys seeing you, dear Adeline; and he will wish to\\ncongratulate Newland.\\\"\\n\\nThe double doors had solemnly reopened and between them appeared Mr.\\nHenry van der Luyden, tall, spare and frock-coated, with faded fair\\nhair, a straight nose like his wife's and the same look of frozen\\ngentleness in eyes that were merely pale grey instead of pale blue.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden greeted Mrs. Archer with cousinly affability,\\nproffered to Newland low-voiced congratulations couched in the same\\nlanguage as his wife's, and seated himself in one of the brocade\\narmchairs with the simplicity of a reigning sovereign.\\n\\n\\\"I had just finished reading the Times,\\\" he said, laying his long\\nfinger-tips together.  \\\"In town my mornings are so much occupied that I\\nfind it more convenient to read the newspapers after luncheon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, there's a great deal to be said for that plan--indeed I think my\\nuncle Egmont used to say he found it less agitating not to read the\\nmorning papers till after dinner,\\\" said Mrs. Archer responsively.\\n\\n\\\"Yes: my good father abhorred hurry.  But now we live in a constant\\nrush,\\\" said Mr. van der Luyden in measured tones, looking with pleasant\\ndeliberation about the large shrouded room which to Archer was so\\ncomplete an image of its owners.\\n\\n\\\"But I hope you HAD finished your reading, Henry?\\\" his wife interposed.\\n\\n\\\"Quite--quite,\\\" he reassured her.\\n\\n\\\"Then I should like Adeline to tell you--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it's really Newland's story,\\\" said his mother smiling; and\\nproceeded to rehearse once more the monstrous tale of the affront\\ninflicted on Mrs. Lovell Mingott.\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" she ended, \\\"Augusta Welland and Mary Mingott both felt\\nthat, especially in view of Newland's engagement, you and Henry OUGHT\\nTO KNOW.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--\\\" said Mr. van der Luyden, drawing a deep breath.\\n\\nThere was a silence during which the tick of the monumental ormolu\\nclock on the white marble mantelpiece grew as loud as the boom of a\\nminute-gun.  Archer contemplated with awe the two slender faded\\nfigures, seated side by side in a kind of viceregal rigidity,\\nmouthpieces of some remote ancestral authority which fate compelled\\nthem to wield, when they would so much rather have lived in simplicity\\nand seclusion, digging invisible weeds out of the perfect lawns of\\nSkuytercliff, and playing Patience together in the evenings.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\\"You really think this is due to some--some intentional interference of\\nLawrence Lefferts's?\\\" he enquired, turning to Archer.\\n\\n\\\"I'm certain of it, sir.  Larry has been going it rather harder than\\nusual lately--if cousin Louisa won't mind my mentioning it--having\\nrather a stiff affair with the postmaster's wife in their village, or\\nsome one of that sort; and whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins to\\nsuspect anything, and he's afraid of trouble, he gets up a fuss of this\\nkind, to show how awfully moral he is, and talks at the top of his\\nvoice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he\\ndoesn't wish her to know.  He's simply using Madame Olenska as a\\nlightning-rod; I've seen him try the same thing often before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The LEFFERTSES!--\\\" said Mrs. van der Luyden.\\n\\n\\\"The LEFFERTSES!--\\\" echoed Mrs. Archer.  \\\"What would uncle Egmont have\\nsaid of Lawrence Lefferts's pronouncing on anybody's social position?\\nIt shows what Society has come to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We'll hope it has not quite come to that,\\\" said Mr. van der Luyden\\nfirmly.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, if only you and Louisa went out more!\\\" sighed Mrs. Archer.\\n\\nBut instantly she became aware of her mistake.  The van der Luydens\\nwere morbidly sensitive to any criticism of their secluded existence.\\nThey were the arbiters of fashion, the Court of last Appeal, and they\\nknew it, and bowed to their fate.  But being shy and retiring persons,\\nwith no natural inclination for their part, they lived as much as\\npossible in the sylvan solitude of Skuytercliff, and when they came to\\ntown, declined all invitations on the plea of Mrs. van der Luyden's\\nhealth.\\n\\nNewland Archer came to his mother's rescue.  \\\"Everybody in New York\\nknows what you and cousin Louisa represent.  That's why Mrs. Mingott\\nfelt she ought not to allow this slight on Countess Olenska to pass\\nwithout consulting you.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. van der Luyden glanced at her husband, who glanced back at her.\\n\\n\\\"It is the principle that I dislike,\\\" said Mr. van der Luyden.  \\\"As\\nlong as a member of a well-known family is backed up by that family it\\nshould be considered--final.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems so to me,\\\" said his wife, as if she were producing a new\\nthought.\\n\\n\\\"I had no idea,\\\" Mr. van der Luyden continued, \\\"that things had come to\\nsuch a pass.\\\"  He paused, and looked at his wife again.  \\\"It occurs to\\nme, my dear, that the Countess Olenska is already a sort of\\nrelation--through Medora Manson's first husband.  At any rate, she will\\nbe when Newland marries.\\\"  He turned toward the young man.  \\\"Have you\\nread this morning's Times, Newland?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes, sir,\\\" said Archer, who usually tossed off half a dozen\\npapers with his morning coffee.\\n\\nHusband and wife looked at each other again.  Their pale eyes clung\\ntogether in prolonged and serious consultation; then a faint smile\\nfluttered over Mrs. van der Luyden's face.  She had evidently guessed\\nand approved.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden turned to Mrs. Archer.  \\\"If Louisa's health allowed\\nher to dine out--I wish you would say to Mrs. Lovell Mingott--she and I\\nwould have been happy to--er--fill the places of the Lawrence\\nLeffertses at her dinner.\\\"  He paused to let the irony of this sink in.\\n\\\"As you know, this is impossible.\\\"  Mrs. Archer sounded a sympathetic\\nassent.  \\\"But Newland tells me he has read this morning's Times;\\ntherefore he has probably seen that Louisa's relative, the Duke of St.\\nAustrey, arrives next week on the Russia.  He is coming to enter his\\nnew sloop, the Guinevere, in next summer's International Cup Race; and\\nalso to have a little canvasback shooting at Trevenna.\\\"  Mr. van der\\nLuyden paused again, and continued with increasing benevolence:\\n\\\"Before taking him down to Maryland we are inviting a few friends to\\nmeet him here--only a little dinner--with a reception afterward.  I am\\nsure Louisa will be as glad as I am if Countess Olenska will let us\\ninclude her among our guests.\\\"  He got up, bent his long body with a\\nstiff friendliness toward his cousin, and added:  \\\"I think I have\\nLouisa's authority for saying that she will herself leave the\\ninvitation to dine when she drives out presently: with our cards--of\\ncourse with our cards.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer, who knew this to be a hint that the seventeen-hand\\nchestnuts which were never kept waiting were at the door, rose with a\\nhurried murmur of thanks.  Mrs. van der Luyden beamed on her with the\\nsmile of Esther interceding with Ahasuerus; but her husband raised a\\nprotesting hand.\\n\\n\\\"There is nothing to thank me for, dear Adeline; nothing whatever.\\nThis kind of thing must not happen in New York; it shall not, as long\\nas I can help it,\\\" he pronounced with sovereign gentleness as he\\nsteered his cousins to the door.\\n\\nTwo hours later, every one knew that the great C-spring barouche in\\nwhich Mrs. van der Luyden took the air at all seasons had been seen at\\nold Mrs. Mingott's door, where a large square envelope was handed in;\\nand that evening at the Opera Mr. Sillerton Jackson was able to state\\nthat the envelope contained a card inviting the Countess Olenska to the\\ndinner which the van der Luydens were giving the following week for\\ntheir cousin, the Duke of St. Austrey.\\n\\nSome of the younger men in the club box exchanged a smile at this\\nannouncement, and glanced sideways at Lawrence Lefferts, who sat\\ncarelessly in the front of the box, pulling his long fair moustache,\\nand who remarked with authority, as the soprano paused:  \\\"No one but\\nPatti ought to attempt the Sonnambula.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was generally agreed in New York that the Countess Olenska had \\\"lost\\nher looks.\\\"\\n\\nShe had appeared there first, in Newland Archer's boyhood, as a\\nbrilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten, of whom people said that\\nshe \\\"ought to be painted.\\\" Her parents had been continental wanderers,\\nand after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and been taken in\\ncharge by her aunt, Medora Manson, also a wanderer, who was herself\\nreturning to New York to \\\"settle down.\\\"\\n\\nPoor Medora, repeatedly widowed, was always coming home to settle down\\n(each time in a less expensive house), and bringing with her a new\\nhusband or an adopted child; but after a few months she invariably\\nparted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward, and, having got\\nrid of her house at a loss, set out again on her wanderings.  As her\\nmother had been a Rushworth, and her last unhappy marriage had linked\\nher to one of the crazy Chiverses, New York looked indulgently on her\\neccentricities; but when she returned with her little orphaned niece,\\nwhose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for\\ntravel, people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in\\nsuch hands.\\n\\nEvery one was disposed to be kind to little Ellen Mingott, though her\\ndusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed\\nunsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her\\nparents.  It was one of the misguided Medora's many peculiarities to\\nflout the unalterable rules that regulated American mourning, and when\\nshe stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that\\nthe crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter\\nthan those of her sisters-in-law, while little Ellen was in crimson\\nmerino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling.\\n\\nBut New York had so long resigned itself to Medora that only a few old\\nladies shook their heads over Ellen's gaudy clothes, while her other\\nrelations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits.\\nShe was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked disconcerting\\nquestions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts,\\nsuch as dancing a Spanish shawl dance and singing Neapolitan love-songs\\nto a guitar.  Under the direction of her aunt (whose real name was Mrs.\\nThorley Chivers, but who, having received a Papal title, had resumed\\nher first husband's patronymic, and called herself the Marchioness\\nManson, because in Italy she could turn it into Manzoni) the little\\ngirl received an expensive but incoherent education, which included\\n\\\"drawing from the model,\\\" a thing never dreamed of before, and playing\\nthe piano in quintets with professional musicians.\\n\\nOf course no good could come of this; and when, a few years later, poor\\nChivers finally died in a madhouse, his widow (draped in strange weeds)\\nagain pulled up stakes and departed with Ellen, who had grown into a\\ntall bony girl with conspicuous eyes.  For some time no more was heard\\nof them; then news came of Ellen's marriage to an immensely rich Polish\\nnobleman of legendary fame, whom she had met at a ball at the\\nTuileries, and who was said to have princely establishments in Paris,\\nNice and Florence, a yacht at Cowes, and many square miles of shooting\\nin Transylvania.  She disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis,\\nand when a few years later Medora again came back to New York, subdued,\\nimpoverished, mourning a third husband, and in quest of a still smaller\\nhouse, people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do\\nsomething for her.  Then came the news that Ellen's own marriage had\\nended in disaster, and that she was herself returning home to seek rest\\nand oblivion among her kinsfolk.\\n\\nThese things passed through Newland Archer's mind a week later as he\\nwatched the Countess Olenska enter the van der Luyden drawing-room on\\nthe evening of the momentous dinner.  The occasion was a solemn one,\\nand he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off.  She\\ncame rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a bracelet\\nabout her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or\\nembarrassment the drawing-room in which New York's most chosen company\\nwas somewhat awfully assembled.\\n\\nIn the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave\\nmouth and smiling eyes; and in that instant Newland Archer rejected the\\ngeneral verdict on her looks.  It was true that her early radiance was\\ngone.  The red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn, a little\\nolder-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty.  But\\nthere was about her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in\\nthe carriage of the head, the movement of the eyes, which, without\\nbeing in the least theatrical, struck his as highly trained and full of\\na conscious power.  At the same time she was simpler in manner than\\nmost of the ladies present, and many people (as he heard afterward from\\nJaney) were disappointed that her appearance was not more\\n\\\"stylish\\\"--for stylishness was what New York most valued.  It was,\\nperhaps, Archer reflected, because her early vivacity had disappeared;\\nbecause she was so quiet--quiet in her movements, her voice, and the\\ntones of her low-pitched voice.  New York had expected something a good\\ndeal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history.\\n\\nThe dinner was a somewhat formidable business.  Dining with the van der\\nLuydens was at best no light matter, and dining there with a Duke who\\nwas their cousin was almost a religious solemnity.  It pleased Archer\\nto think that only an old New Yorker could perceive the shade of\\ndifference (to New York) between being merely a Duke and being the van\\nder Luydens' Duke.  New York took stray noblemen calmly, and even\\n(except in the Struthers set) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but\\nwhen they presented such credentials as these they were received with\\nan old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken\\nin ascribing solely to their standing in Debrett.  It was for just such\\ndistinctions that the young man cherished his old New York even while\\nhe smiled at it.\\n\\nThe van der Luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of\\nthe occasion.  The du Lac Sevres and the Trevenna George II plate were\\nout; so was the van der Luyden \\\"Lowestoft\\\" (East India Company) and the\\nDagonet Crown Derby.  Mrs. van der Luyden looked more than ever like a\\nCabanel, and Mrs. Archer, in her grandmother's seed-pearls and\\nemeralds, reminded her son of an Isabey miniature.  All the ladies had\\non their handsomest jewels, but it was characteristic of the house and\\nthe occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy old-fashioned\\nsettings; and old Miss Lanning, who had been persuaded to come,\\nactually wore her mother's cameos and a Spanish blonde shawl.\\n\\nThe Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as\\nArcher scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond\\nnecklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously\\nimmature compared with hers.  It frightened him to think what must have\\ngone to the making of her eyes.\\n\\nThe Duke of St. Austrey, who sat at his hostess's right, was naturally\\nthe chief figure of the evening.  But if the Countess Olenska was less\\nconspicuous than had been hoped, the Duke was almost invisible.  Being\\na well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal visitor) come to\\nthe dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby\\nand baggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun,\\nthat (with his stooping way of sitting, and the vast beard spreading\\nover his shirt-front) he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner\\nattire.  He was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with a thick nose,\\nsmall eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did\\nit was in such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of\\nexpectation about the table, his remarks were lost to all but his\\nneighbours.\\n\\nWhen the men joined the ladies after dinner the Duke went straight up\\nto the Countess Olenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into\\nanimated talk.  Neither seemed aware that the Duke should first have\\npaid his respects to Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Headly Chivers, and\\nthe Countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac, Mr. Urban\\nDagonet of Washington Square, who, in order to have the pleasure of\\nmeeting her, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out\\nbetween January and April.  The two chatted together for nearly twenty\\nminutes; then the Countess rose and, walking alone across the wide\\ndrawing-room, sat down at Newland Archer's side.\\n\\nIt was not the custom in New York drawing-rooms for a lady to get up\\nand walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of\\nanother.  Etiquette required that she should wait, immovable as an\\nidol, while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each\\nother at her side.  But the Countess was apparently unaware of having\\nbroken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside\\nArcher, and looked at him with the kindest eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I want you to talk to me about May,\\\" she said.\\n\\nInstead of answering her he asked:  \\\"You knew the Duke before?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes--we used to see him every winter at Nice.  He's very fond of\\ngambling--he used to come to the house a great deal.\\\"  She said it in\\nthe simplest manner, as if she had said:  \\\"He's fond of wild-flowers\\\";\\nand after a moment she added candidly:  \\\"I think he's the dullest man I\\never met.\\\"\\n\\nThis pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her\\nprevious remark had caused him.  It was undeniably exciting to meet a\\nlady who found the van der Luydens' Duke dull, and dared to utter the\\nopinion.  He longed to question her, to hear more about the life of\\nwhich her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse; but\\nhe feared to touch on distressing memories, and before he could think\\nof anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject.\\n\\n\\\"May is a darling; I've seen no young girl in New York so handsome and\\nso intelligent.  Are you very much in love with her?\\\"\\n\\nNewland Archer reddened and laughed.  \\\"As much as a man can be.\\\"\\n\\nShe continued to consider him thoughtfully, as if not to miss any shade\\nof meaning in what he said, \\\"Do you think, then, there is a limit?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To being in love?  If there is, I haven't found it!\\\"\\n\\nShe glowed with sympathy.  \\\"Ah--it's really and truly a romance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The most romantic of romances!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How delightful!  And you found it all out for yourselves--it was not\\nin the least arranged for you?\\\"\\n\\nArcher looked at her incredulously.  \\\"Have you forgotten,\\\" he asked\\nwith a smile, \\\"that in our country we don't allow our marriages to be\\narranged for us?\\\"\\n\\nA dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she answered, \\\"I'd forgotten.  You must forgive me if I\\nsometimes make these mistakes.  I don't always remember that everything\\nhere is good that was--that was bad where I've come from.\\\"  She looked\\ndown at her Viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips\\ntrembled.\\n\\n\\\"I'm so sorry,\\\" he said impulsively; \\\"but you ARE among friends here,\\nyou know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--I know.  Wherever I go I have that feeling.  That's why I came\\nhome.  I want to forget everything else, to become a complete American\\nagain, like the Mingotts and Wellands, and you and your delightful\\nmother, and all the other good people here tonight.  Ah, here's May\\narriving, and you will want to hurry away to her,\\\" she added, but\\nwithout moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the\\nyoung man's face.\\n\\nThe drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests,\\nand following Madame Olenska's glance Archer saw May Welland entering\\nwith her mother.  In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of\\nsilver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just\\nalight from the chase.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Archer, \\\"I have so many rivals; you see she's already\\nsurrounded.  There's the Duke being introduced.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then stay with me a little longer,\\\" Madame Olenska said in a low tone,\\njust touching his knee with her plumed fan.  It was the lightest touch,\\nbut it thrilled him like a caress.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, let me stay,\\\" he answered in the same tone, hardly knowing what\\nhe said; but just then Mr. van der Luyden came up, followed by old Mr.\\nUrban Dagonet.  The Countess greeted them with her grave smile, and\\nArcher, feeling his host's admonitory glance on him, rose and\\nsurrendered his seat.\\n\\nMadame Olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye.\\n\\n\\\"Tomorrow, then, after five--I shall expect you,\\\" she said; and then\\nturned back to make room for Mr. Dagonet.\\n\\n\\\"Tomorrow--\\\" Archer heard himself repeating, though there had been no\\nengagement, and during their talk she had given him no hint that she\\nwished to see him again.\\n\\nAs he moved away he saw Lawrence Lefferts, tall and resplendent,\\nleading his wife up to be introduced; and heard Gertrude Lefferts say,\\nas she beamed on the Countess with her large unperceiving smile:  \\\"But\\nI think we used to go to dancing-school together when we were\\nchildren--.\\\"  Behind her, waiting their turn to name themselves to the\\nCountess, Archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had\\ndeclined to meet her at Mrs. Lovell Mingott's.  As Mrs. Archer\\nremarked: when the van der Luydens chose, they knew how to give a\\nlesson.  The wonder was that they chose so seldom.\\n\\nThe young man felt a touch on his arm and saw Mrs. van der Luyden\\nlooking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the\\nfamily diamonds.  \\\"It was good of you, dear Newland, to devote yourself\\nso unselfishly to Madame Olenska.  I told your cousin Henry he must\\nreally come to the rescue.\\\"\\n\\nHe was aware of smiling at her vaguely, and she added, as if\\ncondescending to his natural shyness:  \\\"I've never seen May looking\\nlovelier.  The Duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Countess Olenska had said \\\"after five\\\"; and at half after the hour\\nNewland Archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant\\nwisteria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired,\\nfar down West Twenty-third Street, from the vagabond Medora.\\n\\nIt was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in.  Small\\ndress-makers, bird-stuffers and \\\"people who wrote\\\" were her nearest\\nneighbours; and further down the dishevelled street Archer recognised a\\ndilapidated wooden house, at the end of a paved path, in which a writer\\nand journalist called Winsett, whom he used to come across now and\\nthen, had mentioned that he lived.  Winsett did not invite people to\\nhis house; but he had once pointed it out to Archer in the course of a\\nnocturnal stroll, and the latter had asked himself, with a little\\nshiver, if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals.\\n\\nMadame Olenska's own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance\\nonly by a little more paint about the window-frames; and as Archer\\nmustered its modest front he said to himself that the Polish Count must\\nhave robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions.\\n\\nThe young man had spent an unsatisfactory day.  He had lunched with the\\nWellands, hoping afterward to carry off May for a walk in the Park.  He\\nwanted to have her to himself, to tell her how enchanting she had\\nlooked the night before, and how proud he was of her, and to press her\\nto hasten their marriage.  But Mrs. Welland had firmly reminded him\\nthat the round of family visits was not half over, and, when he hinted\\nat advancing the date of the wedding, had raised reproachful eye-brows\\nand sighed out:  \\\"Twelve dozen of everything--hand-embroidered--\\\"\\n\\nPacked in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to\\nanother, and Archer, when the afternoon's round was over, parted from\\nhis betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild\\nanimal cunningly trapped.  He supposed that his readings in\\nanthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after\\nall a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling; but when he\\nremembered that the Wellands did not expect the wedding to take place\\ntill the following autumn, and pictured what his life would be till\\nthen, a dampness fell upon his spirit.\\n\\n\\\"Tomorrow,\\\" Mrs. Welland called after him, \\\"we'll do the Chiverses and\\nthe Dallases\\\"; and he perceived that she was going through their two\\nfamilies alphabetically, and that they were only in the first quarter\\nof the alphabet.\\n\\nHe had meant to tell May of the Countess Olenska's request--her\\ncommand, rather--that he should call on her that afternoon; but in the\\nbrief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to\\nsay.  Besides, it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the\\nmatter.  He knew that May most particularly wanted him to be kind to\\nher cousin; was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of\\ntheir engagement?  It gave him an odd sensation to reflect that, but\\nfor the Countess's arrival, he might have been, if not still a free\\nman, at least a man less irrevocably pledged.  But May had willed it\\nso, and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibility--and\\ntherefore at liberty, if he chose, to call on her cousin without\\ntelling her.\\n\\nAs he stood on Madame Olenska's threshold curiosity was his uppermost\\nfeeling.  He was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him; he\\nconcluded that she was less simple than she seemed.\\n\\nThe door was opened by a swarthy foreign-looking maid, with a prominent\\nbosom under a gay neckerchief, whom he vaguely fancied to be Sicilian.\\nShe welcomed him with all her white teeth, and answering his enquiries\\nby a head-shake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into\\na low firelit drawing-room.  The room was empty, and she left him, for\\nan appreciable time, to wonder whether she had gone to find her\\nmistress, or whether she had not understood what he was there for, and\\nthought it might be to wind the clock--of which he perceived that the\\nonly visible specimen had stopped.  He knew that the southern races\\ncommunicated with each other in the language of pantomime, and was\\nmortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible.  At length\\nshe returned with a lamp; and Archer, having meanwhile put together a\\nphrase out of Dante and Petrarch, evoked the answer: \\\"La signora e\\nfuori; ma verra subito\\\"; which he took to mean:  \\\"She's out--but you'll\\nsoon see.\\\"\\n\\nWhat he saw, meanwhile, with the help of the lamp, was the faded\\nshadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known.  He knew that the\\nCountess Olenska had brought some of her possessions with her--bits of\\nwreckage, she called them--and these, he supposed, were represented by\\nsome small slender tables of dark wood, a delicate little Greek bronze\\non the chimney-piece, and a stretch of red damask nailed on the\\ndiscoloured wallpaper behind a couple of Italian-looking pictures in\\nold frames.\\n\\nNewland Archer prided himself on his knowledge of Italian art.  His\\nboyhood had been saturated with Ruskin, and he had read all the latest\\nbooks: John Addington Symonds, Vernon Lee's \\\"Euphorion,\\\" the essays of\\nP. G. Hamerton, and a wonderful new volume called \\\"The Renaissance\\\" by\\nWalter Pater.  He talked easily of Botticelli, and spoke of Fra\\nAngelico with a faint condescension.  But these pictures bewildered\\nhim, for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at (and\\ntherefore able to see) when he travelled in Italy; and perhaps, also,\\nhis powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding\\nhimself in this strange empty house, where apparently no one expected\\nhim.  He was sorry that he had not told May Welland of Countess\\nOlenska's request, and a little disturbed by the thought that his\\nbetrothed might come in to see her cousin.  What would she think if she\\nfound him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting\\nalone in the dusk at a lady's fireside?\\n\\nBut since he had come he meant to wait; and he sank into a chair and\\nstretched his feet to the logs.\\n\\nIt was odd to have summoned him in that way, and then forgotten him;\\nbut Archer felt more curious than mortified.  The atmosphere of the\\nroom was so different from any he had ever breathed that\\nself-consciousness vanished in the sense of adventure.  He had been\\nbefore in drawing-rooms hung with red damask, with pictures \\\"of the\\nItalian school\\\"; what struck him was the way in which Medora Manson's\\nshabby hired house, with its blighted background of pampas grass and\\nRogers statuettes, had, by a turn of the hand, and the skilful use of a\\nfew properties, been transformed into something intimate, \\\"foreign,\\\"\\nsubtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments.  He tried to\\nanalyse the trick, to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and\\ntables were grouped, in the fact that only two Jacqueminot roses (of\\nwhich nobody ever bought less than a dozen) had been placed in the\\nslender vase at his elbow, and in the vague pervading perfume that was\\nnot what one put on handkerchiefs, but rather like the scent of some\\nfar-off bazaar, a smell made up of Turkish coffee and ambergris and\\ndried roses.\\n\\nHis mind wandered away to the question of what May's drawing-room would\\nlook like.  He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving \\\"very\\nhandsomely,\\\" already had his eye on a newly built house in East\\nThirty-ninth Street.  The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the\\nhouse was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger\\narchitects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone\\nof which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce;\\nbut the plumbing was perfect.  Archer would have liked to travel, to\\nput off the housing question; but, though the Wellands approved of an\\nextended European honeymoon (perhaps even a winter in Egypt), they were\\nfirm as to the need of a house for the returning couple.  The young man\\nfelt that his fate was sealed: for the rest of his life he would go up\\nevery evening between the cast-iron railings of that greenish-yellow\\ndoorstep, and pass through a Pompeian vestibule into a hall with a\\nwainscoting of varnished yellow wood.  But beyond that his imagination\\ncould not travel.  He knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but\\nhe could not fancy how May would deal with it.  She submitted\\ncheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the Welland\\ndrawing-room, to its sham Buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern\\nSaxe.  He saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything\\ndifferent in her own house; and his only comfort was to reflect that\\nshe would probably let him arrange his library as he pleased--which\\nwould be, of course, with \\\"sincere\\\" Eastlake furniture, and the plain\\nnew bookcases without glass doors.\\n\\nThe round-bosomed maid came in, drew the curtains, pushed back a log,\\nand said consolingly: \\\"Verra--verra.\\\"  When she had gone Archer stood\\nup and began to wander about.  Should he wait any longer?  His position\\nwas becoming rather foolish.  Perhaps he had misunderstood Madame\\nOlenska--perhaps she had not invited him after all.\\n\\nDown the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a stepper's\\nhoofs; they stopped before the house, and he caught the opening of a\\ncarriage door.  Parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk.\\nA street-lamp faced him, and in its light he saw Julius Beaufort's\\ncompact English brougham, drawn by a big roan, and the banker\\ndescending from it, and helping out Madame Olenska.\\n\\nBeaufort stood, hat in hand, saying something which his companion\\nseemed to negative; then they shook hands, and he jumped into his\\ncarriage while she mounted the steps.\\n\\nWhen she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing Archer\\nthere; surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to.\\n\\n\\\"How do you like my funny house?\\\" she asked.  \\\"To me it's like heaven.\\\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away\\nwith her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes.\\n\\n\\\"You've arranged it delightfully,\\\" he rejoined, alive to the flatness\\nof the words, but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming\\ndesire to be simple and striking.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it's a poor little place.  My relations despise it.  But at any\\nrate it's less gloomy than the van der Luydens'.\\\"\\n\\nThe words gave him an electric shock, for few were the rebellious\\nspirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der\\nLuydens gloomy.  Those privileged to enter it shivered there, and spoke\\nof it as \\\"handsome.\\\"  But suddenly he was glad that she had given voice\\nto the general shiver.\\n\\n\\\"It's delicious--what you've done here,\\\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\\"I like the little house,\\\" she admitted; \\\"but I suppose what I like is\\nthe blessedness of its being here, in my own country and my own town;\\nand then, of being alone in it.\\\"  She spoke so low that he hardly heard\\nthe last phrase; but in his awkwardness he took it up.\\n\\n\\\"You like so much to be alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely.\\\"  She sat down\\nnear the fire, said:  \\\"Nastasia will bring the tea presently,\\\" and\\nsigned to him to return to his armchair, adding:  \\\"I see you've already\\nchosen your corner.\\\"\\n\\nLeaning back, she folded her arms behind her head, and looked at the\\nfire under drooping lids.\\n\\n\\\"This is the hour I like best--don't you?\\\"\\n\\nA proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: \\\"I was afraid you'd\\nforgotten the hour.  Beaufort must have been very engrossing.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked amused.  \\\"Why--have you waited long?  Mr. Beaufort took me\\nto see a number of houses--since it seems I'm not to be allowed to stay\\nin this one.\\\"  She appeared to dismiss both Beaufort and himself from\\nher mind, and went on:  \\\"I've never been in a city where there seems to\\nbe such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques.  What\\ndoes it matter where one lives?  I'm told this street is respectable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not fashionable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fashionable!  Do you all think so much of that?  Why not make one's\\nown fashions?  But I suppose I've lived too independently; at any rate,\\nI want to do what you all do--I want to feel cared for and safe.\\\"\\n\\nHe was touched, as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her\\nneed of guidance.\\n\\n\\\"That's what your friends want you to feel.  New York's an awfully safe\\nplace,\\\" he added with a flash of sarcasm.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, isn't it?  One feels that,\\\" she cried, missing the mockery.\\n\\\"Being here is like--like--being taken on a holiday when one has been a\\ngood little girl and done all one's lessons.\\\"\\n\\nThe analogy was well meant, but did not altogether please him.  He did\\nnot mind being flippant about New York, but disliked to hear any one\\nelse take the same tone.  He wondered if she did not begin to see what\\na powerful engine it was, and how nearly it had crushed her.  The\\nLovell Mingotts' dinner, patched up in extremis out of all sorts of\\nsocial odds and ends, ought to have taught her the narrowness of her\\nescape; but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted\\ndisaster, or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van\\nder Luyden evening.  Archer inclined to the former theory; he fancied\\nthat her New York was still completely undifferentiated, and the\\nconjecture nettled him.\\n\\n\\\"Last night,\\\" he said, \\\"New York laid itself out for you.  The van der\\nLuydens do nothing by halves.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No: how kind they are!  It was such a nice party.  Every one seems to\\nhave such an esteem for them.\\\"\\n\\nThe terms were hardly adequate; she might have spoken in that way of a\\ntea-party at the dear old Miss Lannings'.\\n\\n\\\"The van der Luydens,\\\" said Archer, feeling himself pompous as he\\nspoke, \\\"are the most powerful influence in New York society.\\nUnfortunately--owing to her health--they receive very seldom.\\\"\\n\\nShe unclasped her hands from behind her head, and looked at him\\nmeditatively.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't that perhaps the reason?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The reason--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For their great influence; that they make themselves so rare.\\\"\\n\\nHe coloured a little, stared at her--and suddenly felt the penetration\\nof the remark.  At a stroke she had pricked the van der Luydens and\\nthey collapsed.  He laughed, and sacrificed them.\\n\\nNastasia brought the tea, with handleless Japanese cups and little\\ncovered dishes, placing the tray on a low table.\\n\\n\\\"But you'll explain these things to me--you'll tell me all I ought to\\nknow,\\\" Madame Olenska continued, leaning forward to hand him his cup.\\n\\n\\\"It's you who are telling me; opening my eyes to things I'd looked at\\nso long that I'd ceased to see them.\\\"\\n\\nShe detached a small gold cigarette-case from one of her bracelets,\\nheld it out to him, and took a cigarette herself.  On the chimney were\\nlong spills for lighting them.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, then we can both help each other.  But I want help so much more.\\nYou must tell me just what to do.\\\"\\n\\nIt was on the tip of his tongue to reply:  \\\"Don't be seen driving about\\nthe streets with Beaufort--\\\" but he was being too deeply drawn into the\\natmosphere of the room, which was her atmosphere, and to give advice of\\nthat sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for\\nattar-of-roses in Samarkand that one should always be provided with\\narctics for a New York winter.  New York seemed much farther off than\\nSamarkand, and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering\\nwhat might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look\\nat his native city objectively.  Viewed thus, as through the wrong end\\nof a telescope, it looked disconcertingly small and distant; but then\\nfrom Samarkand it would.\\n\\nA flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire, stretching her\\nthin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails.\\nThe light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her\\nbraids, and made her pale face paler.\\n\\n\\\"There are plenty of people to tell you what to do,\\\" Archer rejoined,\\nobscurely envious of them.\\n\\n\\\"Oh--all my aunts?  And my dear old Granny?\\\"  She considered the idea\\nimpartially.  \\\"They're all a little vexed with me for setting up for\\nmyself--poor Granny especially.  She wanted to keep me with her; but I\\nhad to be free--\\\"  He was impressed by this light way of speaking of\\nthe formidable Catherine, and moved by the thought of what must have\\ngiven Madame Olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of\\nfreedom.  But the idea of Beaufort gnawed him.\\n\\n\\\"I think I understand how you feel,\\\" he said.  \\\"Still, your family can\\nadvise you; explain differences; show you the way.\\\"\\n\\nShe lifted her thin black eyebrows.  \\\"Is New York such a labyrinth?  I\\nthought it so straight up and down--like Fifth Avenue.  And with all\\nthe cross streets numbered!\\\"  She seemed to guess his faint disapproval\\nof this, and added, with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face:\\n\\\"If you knew how I like it for just THAT--the straight-up-and-downness,\\nand the big honest labels on everything!\\\"\\n\\nHe saw his chance.  \\\"Everything may be labelled--but everybody is not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps.  I may simplify too much--but you'll warn me if I do.\\\"  She\\nturned from the fire to look at him.  \\\"There are only two people here\\nwho make me feel as if they understood what I mean and could explain\\nthings to me: you and Mr. Beaufort.\\\"\\n\\nArcher winced at the joining of the names, and then, with a quick\\nreadjustment, understood, sympathised and pitied.  So close to the\\npowers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely\\nin their air.  But since she felt that he understood her also, his\\nbusiness would be to make her see Beaufort as he really was, with all\\nhe represented--and abhor it.\\n\\nHe answered gently:  \\\"I understand.  But just at first don't let go of\\nyour old friends' hands: I mean the older women, your Granny Mingott,\\nMrs. Welland, Mrs. van der Luyden.  They like and admire you--they want\\nto help you.\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her head and sighed.  \\\"Oh, I know--I know!  But on condition\\nthat they don't hear anything unpleasant.  Aunt Welland put it in those\\nvery words when I tried....  Does no one want to know the truth here,\\nMr. Archer?  The real loneliness is living among all these kind people\\nwho only ask one to pretend!\\\" She lifted her hands to her face, and he\\nsaw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob.\\n\\n\\\"Madame Olenska!--Oh, don't, Ellen,\\\" he cried, starting up and bending\\nover her.  He drew down one of her hands, clasping and chafing it like\\na child's while he murmured reassuring words; but in a moment she freed\\nherself, and looked up at him with wet lashes.\\n\\n\\\"Does no one cry here, either?  I suppose there's no need to, in\\nheaven,\\\" she said, straightening her loosened braids with a laugh, and\\nbending over the tea-kettle.  It was burnt into his consciousness that\\nhe had called her \\\"Ellen\\\"--called her so twice; and that she had not\\nnoticed it.  Far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white\\nfigure of May Welland--in New York.\\n\\nSuddenly Nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich Italian.\\n\\nMadame Olenska, again with a hand at her hair, uttered an exclamation\\nof assent--a flashing \\\"Gia--gia\\\"--and the Duke of St. Austrey entered,\\npiloting a tremendous blackwigged and red-plumed lady in overflowing\\nfurs.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Countess, I've brought an old friend of mine to see you--Mrs.\\nStruthers.  She wasn't asked to the party last night, and she wants to\\nknow you.\\\"\\n\\nThe Duke beamed on the group, and Madame Olenska advanced with a murmur\\nof welcome toward the queer couple.  She seemed to have no idea how\\noddly matched they were, nor what a liberty the Duke had taken in\\nbringing his companion--and to do him justice, as Archer perceived, the\\nDuke seemed as unaware of it himself.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I want to know you, my dear,\\\" cried Mrs. Struthers in a\\nround rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig.\\n\\\"I want to know everybody who's young and interesting and charming.\\nAnd the Duke tells me you like music--didn't you, Duke?  You're a\\npianist yourself, I believe?  Well, do you want to hear Sarasate play\\ntomorrow evening at my house?  You know I've something going on every\\nSunday evening--it's the day when New York doesn't know what to do with\\nitself, and so I say to it:  'Come and be amused.'  And the Duke\\nthought you'd be tempted by Sarasate.  You'll find a number of your\\nfriends.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska's face grew brilliant with pleasure.  \\\"How kind!  How\\ngood of the Duke to think of me!\\\" She pushed a chair up to the\\ntea-table and Mrs. Struthers sank into it delectably.  \\\"Of course I\\nshall be too happy to come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all right, my dear.  And bring your young gentleman with you.\\\"\\nMrs. Struthers extended a hail-fellow hand to Archer.  \\\"I can't put a\\nname to you--but I'm sure I've met you--I've met everybody, here, or in\\nParis or London.  Aren't you in diplomacy?  All the diplomatists come\\nto me.  You like music too?  Duke, you must be sure to bring him.\\\"\\n\\nThe Duke said \\\"Rather\\\" from the depths of his beard, and Archer\\nwithdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of\\nspine as a self-conscious school-boy among careless and unnoticing\\nelders.\\n\\nHe was not sorry for the denouement of his visit: he only wished it had\\ncome sooner, and spared him a certain waste of emotion.  As he went out\\ninto the wintry night, New York again became vast and imminent, and May\\nWelland the loveliest woman in it.  He turned into his florist's to\\nsend her the daily box of lilies-of-the-valley which, to his confusion,\\nhe found he had forgotten that morning.\\n\\nAs he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced\\nabout the embowered shop, and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses.\\nHe had never seen any as sun-golden before, and his first impulse was\\nto send them to May instead of the lilies.  But they did not look like\\nher--there was something too rich, too strong, in their fiery beauty.\\nIn a sudden revulsion of mood, and almost without knowing what he did,\\nhe signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box, and\\nslipped his card into a second envelope, on which he wrote the name of\\nthe Countess Olenska; then, just as he was turning away, he drew the\\ncard out again, and left the empty envelope on the box.\\n\\n\\\"They'll go at once?\\\" he enquired, pointing to the roses.\\n\\nThe florist assured him that they would.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day he persuaded May to escape for a walk in the Park after\\nluncheon.  As was the custom in old-fashioned Episcopalian New York,\\nshe usually accompanied her parents to church on Sunday afternoons; but\\nMrs. Welland condoned her truancy, having that very morning won her\\nover to the necessity of a long engagement, with time to prepare a\\nhand-embroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens.\\n\\nThe day was delectable.  The bare vaulting of trees along the Mall was\\nceiled with lapis lazuli, and arched above snow that shone like\\nsplintered crystals.  It was the weather to call out May's radiance,\\nand she burned like a young maple in the frost.  Archer was proud of\\nthe glances turned on her, and the simple joy of possessorship cleared\\naway his underlying perplexities.\\n\\n\\\"It's so delicious--waking every morning to smell lilies-of-the-valley\\nin one's room!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Yesterday they came late.  I hadn't time in the morning--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much\\nmore than if you'd given a standing order, and they came every morning\\non the minute, like one's music-teacher--as I know Gertrude Lefferts's\\ndid, for instance, when she and Lawrence were engaged.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--they would!\\\" laughed Archer, amused at her keenness.  He looked\\nsideways at her fruit-like cheek and felt rich and secure enough to\\nadd:  \\\"When I sent your lilies yesterday afternoon I saw some rather\\ngorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to Madame Olenska.  Was that\\nright?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How dear of you!  Anything of that kind delights her.  It's odd she\\ndidn't mention it: she lunched with us today, and spoke of Mr.\\nBeaufort's having sent her wonderful orchids, and cousin Henry van der\\nLuyden a whole hamper of carnations from Skuytercliff.  She seems so\\nsurprised to receive flowers.  Don't people send them in Europe?  She\\nthinks it such a pretty custom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well, no wonder mine were overshadowed by Beaufort's,\\\" said Archer\\nirritably.  Then he remembered that he had not put a card with the\\nroses, and was vexed at having spoken of them.  He wanted to say:  \\\"I\\ncalled on your cousin yesterday,\\\" but hesitated.  If Madame Olenska had\\nnot spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should.  Yet not\\nto do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked.  To shake\\noff the question he began to talk of their own plans, their future, and\\nMrs. Welland's insistence on a long engagement.\\n\\n\\\"If you call it long!  Isabel Chivers and Reggie were engaged for two\\nyears: Grace and Thorley for nearly a year and a half.  Why aren't we\\nvery well off as we are?\\\"\\n\\nIt was the traditional maidenly interrogation, and he felt ashamed of\\nhimself for finding it singularly childish.  No doubt she simply echoed\\nwhat was said for her; but she was nearing her twenty-second birthday,\\nand he wondered at what age \\\"nice\\\" women began to speak for themselves.\\n\\n\\\"Never, if we won't let them, I suppose,\\\" he mused, and recalled his\\nmad outburst to Mr. Sillerton Jackson: \\\"Women ought to be as free as we\\nare--\\\"\\n\\nIt would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young\\nwoman's eyes, and bid her look forth on the world.  But how many\\ngenerations of the women who had gone to her making had descended\\nbandaged to the family vault?  He shivered a little, remembering some\\nof the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much-cited instance\\nof the Kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because\\nthey had no use for them.  What if, when he had bidden May Welland to\\nopen hers, they could only look out blankly at blankness?\\n\\n\\\"We might be much better off.  We might be altogether together--we\\nmight travel.\\\"\\n\\nHer face lit up.  \\\"That would be lovely,\\\" she owned: she would love to\\ntravel.  But her mother would not understand their wanting to do things\\nso differently.\\n\\n\\\"As if the mere 'differently' didn't account for it!\\\" the wooer\\ninsisted.\\n\\n\\\"Newland!  You're so original!\\\" she exulted.\\n\\nHis heart sank, for he saw that he was saying all the things that young\\nmen in the same situation were expected to say, and that she was making\\nthe answers that instinct and tradition taught her to make--even to the\\npoint of calling him original.\\n\\n\\\"Original!  We're all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the\\nsame folded paper.  We're like patterns stencilled on a wall.  Can't\\nyou and I strike out for ourselves, May?\\\"\\n\\nHe had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion, and\\nher eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration.\\n\\n\\\"Mercy--shall we elope?\\\" she laughed.\\n\\n\\\"If you would--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You DO love me, Newland!  I'm so happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But then--why not be happier?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can't behave like people in novels, though, can we?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not--why not--why not?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked a little bored by his insistence.  She knew very well that\\nthey couldn't, but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason.\\n\\\"I'm not clever enough to argue with you.  But that kind of thing is\\nrather--vulgar, isn't it?\\\" she suggested, relieved to have hit on a\\nword that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject.\\n\\n\\\"Are you so much afraid, then, of being vulgar?\\\"\\n\\nShe was evidently staggered by this.  \\\"Of course I should hate it--so\\nwould you,\\\" she rejoined, a trifle irritably.\\n\\nHe stood silent, beating his stick nervously against his boot-top; and\\nfeeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the\\ndiscussion, she went on light-heartedly: \\\"Oh, did I tell you that I\\nshowed Ellen my ring?  She thinks it the most beautiful setting she\\never saw.  There's nothing like it in the rue de la Paix, she said.  I\\ndo love you, Newland, for being so artistic!\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe next afternoon, as Archer, before dinner, sat smoking sullenly in\\nhis study, Janey wandered in on him.  He had failed to stop at his club\\non the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the\\nlaw in the leisurely manner common to well-to-do New Yorkers of his\\nclass.  He was out of spirits and slightly out of temper, and a\\nhaunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour\\nbesieged his brain.\\n\\n\\\"Sameness--sameness!\\\" he muttered, the word running through his head\\nlike a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tall-hatted figures\\nlounging behind the plate-glass; and because he usually dropped in at\\nthe club at that hour he had gone home instead.  He knew not only what\\nthey were likely to be talking about, but the part each one would take\\nin the discussion.  The Duke of course would be their principal theme;\\nthough the appearance in Fifth Avenue of a golden-haired lady in a\\nsmall canary-coloured brougham with a pair of black cobs (for which\\nBeaufort was generally thought responsible) would also doubtless be\\nthoroughly gone into.  Such \\\"women\\\" (as they were called) were few in\\nNew York, those driving their own carriages still fewer, and the\\nappearance of Miss Fanny Ring in Fifth Avenue at the fashionable hour\\nhad profoundly agitated society.  Only the day before, her carriage had\\npassed Mrs. Lovell Mingott's, and the latter had instantly rung the\\nlittle bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home.\\n\\\"What if it had happened to Mrs. van der Luyden?\\\" people asked each\\nother with a shudder.  Archer could hear Lawrence Lefferts, at that\\nvery hour, holding forth on the disintegration of society.\\n\\nHe raised his head irritably when his sister Janey entered, and then\\nquickly bent over his book (Swinburne's \\\"Chastelard\\\"--just out) as if\\nhe had not seen her.  She glanced at the writing-table heaped with\\nbooks, opened a volume of the \\\"Contes Drolatiques,\\\" made a wry face\\nover the archaic French, and sighed:  \\\"What learned things you read!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--?\\\" he asked, as she hovered Cassandra-like before him.\\n\\n\\\"Mother's very angry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Angry?  With whom?  About what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Miss Sophy Jackson has just been here.  She brought word that her\\nbrother would come in after dinner: she couldn't say very much, because\\nhe forbade her to: he wishes to give all the details himself.  He's\\nwith cousin Louisa van der Luyden now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For heaven's sake, my dear girl, try a fresh start.  It would take an\\nomniscient Deity to know what you're talking about.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's not a time to be profane, Newland....  Mother feels badly enough\\nabout your not going to church ...\\\"\\n\\nWith a groan he plunged back into his book.\\n\\n\\\"NEWLAND!  Do listen.  Your friend Madame Olenska was at Mrs. Lemuel\\nStruthers's party last night: she went there with the Duke and Mr.\\nBeaufort.\\\"\\n\\nAt the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the\\nyoung man's breast.  To smother it he laughed.  \\\"Well, what of it?  I\\nknew she meant to.\\\"\\n\\nJaney paled and her eyes began to project.  \\\"You knew she meant to--and\\nyou didn't try to stop her?  To warn her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stop her?  Warn her?\\\"  He laughed again.  \\\"I'm not engaged to be\\nmarried to the Countess Olenska!\\\"  The words had a fantastic sound in\\nhis own ears.\\n\\n\\\"You're marrying into her family.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, family--family!\\\" he jeered.\\n\\n\\\"Newland--don't you care about Family?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a brass farthing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor about what cousin Louisa van der Luyden will think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not the half of one--if she thinks such old maid's rubbish.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother is not an old maid,\\\" said his virgin sister with pinched lips.\\n\\nHe felt like shouting back:  \\\"Yes, she is, and so are the van der\\nLuydens, and so we all are, when it comes to being so much as brushed\\nby the wing-tip of Reality.\\\" But he saw her long gentle face puckering\\ninto tears, and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting.\\n\\n\\\"Hang Countess Olenska!  Don't be a goose, Janey--I'm not her keeper.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; but you DID ask the Wellands to announce your engagement sooner so\\nthat we might all back her up; and if it hadn't been for that cousin\\nLouisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the Duke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--what harm was there in inviting her?  She was the best-looking\\nwoman in the room; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the\\nusual van der Luyden banquet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know cousin Henry asked her to please you: he persuaded cousin\\nLouisa.  And now they're so upset that they're going back to\\nSkuytercliff tomorrow.  I think, Newland, you'd better come down.  You\\ndon't seem to understand how mother feels.\\\"\\n\\nIn the drawing-room Newland found his mother.  She raised a troubled\\nbrow from her needlework to ask: \\\"Has Janey told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"  He tried to keep his tone as measured as her own.  \\\"But I can't\\ntake it very seriously.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not the fact of having offended cousin Louisa and cousin Henry?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as Countess\\nOlenska's going to the house of a woman they consider common.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Consider--!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, who is; but who has good music, and amuses people on Sunday\\nevenings, when the whole of New York is dying of inanition.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good music?  All I know is, there was a woman who got up on a table\\nand sang the things they sing at the places you go to in Paris.  There\\nwas smoking and champagne.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--that kind of thing happens in other places, and the world still\\ngoes on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't suppose, dear, you're really defending the French Sunday?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've heard you often enough, mother, grumble at the English Sunday\\nwhen we've been in London.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"New York is neither Paris nor London.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, it's not!\\\" her son groaned.\\n\\n\\\"You mean, I suppose, that society here is not as brilliant?  You're\\nright, I daresay; but we belong here, and people should respect our\\nways when they come among us.  Ellen Olenska especially: she came back\\nto get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies.\\\"\\n\\nNewland made no answer, and after a moment his mother ventured:  \\\"I was\\ngoing to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin Louisa\\nfor a moment before dinner.\\\"  He frowned, and she continued: \\\"I thought\\nyou might explain to her what you've just said: that society abroad is\\ndifferent ... that people are not as particular, and that Madame\\nOlenska may not have realised how we feel about such things.  It would\\nbe, you know, dear,\\\" she added with an innocent adroitness, \\\"in Madame\\nOlenska's interest if you did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dearest mother, I really don't see how we're concerned in the matter.\\nThe Duke took Madame Olenska to Mrs. Struthers's--in fact he brought\\nMrs. Struthers to call on her.  I was there when they came.  If the van\\nder Luydens want to quarrel with anybody, the real culprit is under\\ntheir own roof.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quarrel?  Newland, did you ever know of cousin Henry's quarrelling?\\nBesides, the Duke's his guest; and a stranger too.  Strangers don't\\ndiscriminate: how should they?  Countess Olenska is a New Yorker, and\\nshould have respected the feelings of New York.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, if they must have a victim, you have my leave to throw\\nMadame Olenska to them,\\\" cried her son, exasperated.  \\\"I don't see\\nmyself--or you either--offering ourselves up to expiate her crimes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, of course you see only the Mingott side,\\\" his mother answered, in\\nthe sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger.\\n\\nThe sad butler drew back the drawing-room portieres and announced:\\n\\\"Mr. Henry van der Luyden.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an\\nagitated hand.\\n\\n\\\"Another lamp,\\\" she cried to the retreating servant, while Janey bent\\nover to straighten her mother's cap.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden's figure loomed on the threshold, and Newland Archer\\nwent forward to greet his cousin.\\n\\n\\\"We were just talking about you, sir,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement.  He drew off\\nhis glove to shake hands with the ladies, and smoothed his tall hat\\nshyly, while Janey pushed an arm-chair forward, and Archer continued:\\n\\\"And the Countess Olenska.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer paled.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--a charming woman.  I have just been to see her,\\\" said Mr. van der\\nLuyden, complacency restored to his brow.  He sank into the chair, laid\\nhis hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the old-fashioned way,\\nand went on:  \\\"She has a real gift for arranging flowers.  I had sent\\nher a few carnations from Skuytercliff, and I was astonished.  Instead\\nof massing them in big bunches as our head-gardener does, she had\\nscattered them about loosely, here and there ... I can't say how.  The\\nDuke had told me: he said:  'Go and see how cleverly she's arranged her\\ndrawing-room.'  And she has.  I should really like to take Louisa to\\nsee her, if the neighbourhood were not so--unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\nA dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from Mr. van der\\nLuyden.  Mrs. Archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which\\nshe had nervously tumbled it, and Newland, leaning against the\\nchimney-place and twisting a humming-bird-feather screen in his hand,\\nsaw Janey's gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp.\\n\\n\\\"The fact is,\\\" Mr. van der Luyden continued, stroking his long grey leg\\nwith a bloodless hand weighed down by the Patroon's great signet-ring,\\n\\\"the fact is, I dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she\\nwrote me about my flowers; and also--but this is between ourselves, of\\ncourse--to give her a friendly warning about allowing the Duke to carry\\nher off to parties with him.  I don't know if you've heard--\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer produced an indulgent smile.  \\\"Has the Duke been carrying\\nher off to parties?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know what these English grandees are.  They're all alike.  Louisa\\nand I are very fond of our cousin--but it's hopeless to expect people\\nwho are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about\\nour little republican distinctions.  The Duke goes where he's amused.\\\"\\nMr. van der Luyden paused, but no one spoke.  \\\"Yes--it seems he took\\nher with him last night to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's.  Sillerton Jackson\\nhas just been to us with the foolish story, and Louisa was rather\\ntroubled.  So I thought the shortest way was to go straight to Countess\\nOlenska and explain--by the merest hint, you know--how we feel in New\\nYork about certain things.  I felt I might, without indelicacy, because\\nthe evening she dined with us she rather suggested ... rather let me\\nsee that she would be grateful for guidance.  And she WAS.\\\"\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden looked about the room with what would have been\\nself-satisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions.  On\\nhis face it became a mild benevolence which Mrs. Archer's countenance\\ndutifully reflected.\\n\\n\\\"How kind you both are, dear Henry--always!  Newland will particularly\\nappreciate what you have done because of dear May and his new\\nrelations.\\\"\\n\\nShe shot an admonitory glance at her son, who said: \\\"Immensely, sir.\\nBut I was sure you'd like Madame Olenska.\\\"\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness.  \\\"I never ask\\nto my house, my dear Newland,\\\" he said, \\\"any one whom I do not like.\\nAnd so I have just told Sillerton Jackson.\\\"  With a glance at the clock\\nhe rose and added:  \\\"But Louisa will be waiting.  We are dining early,\\nto take the Duke to the Opera.\\\"\\n\\nAfter the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence\\nfell upon the Archer family.\\n\\n\\\"Gracious--how romantic!\\\" at last broke explosively from Janey.  No one\\nknew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments, and her relations had\\nlong since given up trying to interpret them.\\n\\nMrs. Archer shook her head with a sigh.  \\\"Provided it all turns out for\\nthe best,\\\" she said, in the tone of one who knows how surely it will\\nnot.  \\\"Newland, you must stay and see Sillerton Jackson when he comes\\nthis evening: I really shan't know what to say to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor mother!  But he won't come--\\\" her son laughed, stooping to kiss\\naway her frown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome two weeks later, Newland Archer, sitting in abstracted idleness in\\nhis private compartment of the office of Letterblair, Lamson and Low,\\nattorneys at law, was summoned by the head of the firm.\\n\\nOld Mr. Letterblair, the accredited legal adviser of three generations\\nof New York gentility, throned behind his mahogany desk in evident\\nperplexity.  As he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his\\nhand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows, his\\ndisrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the Family\\nPhysician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified.\\n\\n\\\"My dear sir--\\\" he always addressed Archer as \\\"sir\\\"--\\\"I have sent for\\nyou to go into a little matter; a matter which, for the moment, I\\nprefer not to mention either to Mr. Skipworth or Mr. Redwood.\\\"  The\\ngentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm; for,\\nas was always the case with legal associations of old standing in New\\nYork, all the partners named on the office letter-head were long since\\ndead; and Mr. Letterblair, for example, was, professionally speaking,\\nhis own grandson.\\n\\nHe leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow.  \\\"For family\\nreasons--\\\" he continued.\\n\\nArcher looked up.\\n\\n\\\"The Mingott family,\\\" said Mr. Letterblair with an explanatory smile\\nand bow.  \\\"Mrs. Manson Mingott sent for me yesterday.  Her\\ngrand-daughter the Countess Olenska wishes to sue her husband for\\ndivorce.  Certain papers have been placed in my hands.\\\"  He paused and\\ndrummed on his desk.  \\\"In view of your prospective alliance with the\\nfamily I should like to consult you--to consider the case with\\nyou--before taking any farther steps.\\\"\\n\\nArcher felt the blood in his temples.  He had seen the Countess Olenska\\nonly once since his visit to her, and then at the Opera, in the Mingott\\nbox.  During this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate\\nimage, receding from his foreground as May Welland resumed her rightful\\nplace in it.  He had not heard her divorce spoken of since Janey's\\nfirst random allusion to it, and had dismissed the tale as unfounded\\ngossip.  Theoretically, the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful\\nto him as to his mother; and he was annoyed that Mr. Letterblair (no\\ndoubt prompted by old Catherine Mingott) should be so evidently\\nplanning to draw him into the affair.  After all, there were plenty of\\nMingott men for such jobs, and as yet he was not even a Mingott by\\nmarriage.\\n\\nHe waited for the senior partner to continue.  Mr. Letterblair unlocked\\na drawer and drew out a packet.  \\\"If you will run your eye over these\\npapers--\\\"\\n\\nArcher frowned.  \\\"I beg your pardon, sir; but just because of the\\nprospective relationship, I should prefer your consulting Mr. Skipworth\\nor Mr. Redwood.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended.  It was unusual\\nfor a junior to reject such an opening.\\n\\nHe bowed.  \\\"I respect your scruple, sir; but in this case I believe\\ntrue delicacy requires you to do as I ask.  Indeed, the suggestion is\\nnot mine but Mrs. Manson Mingott's and her son's.  I have seen Lovell\\nMingott; and also Mr. Welland.  They all named you.\\\"\\n\\nArcher felt his temper rising.  He had been somewhat languidly drifting\\nwith events for the last fortnight, and letting May's fair looks and\\nradiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the\\nMingott claims.  But this behest of old Mrs. Mingott's roused him to a\\nsense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a\\nprospective son-in-law; and he chafed at the role.\\n\\n\\\"Her uncles ought to deal with this,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"They have.  The matter has been gone into by the family.  They are\\nopposed to the Countess's idea; but she is firm, and insists on a legal\\nopinion.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man was silent: he had not opened the packet in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Does she want to marry again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe it is suggested; but she denies it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you oblige me, Mr. Archer, by first looking through these papers?\\nAfterward, when we have talked the case over, I will give you my\\nopinion.\\\"\\n\\nArcher withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents.  Since their\\nlast meeting he had half-unconsciously collaborated with events in\\nridding himself of the burden of Madame Olenska.  His hour alone with\\nher by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which\\nthe Duke of St. Austrey's intrusion with Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and the\\nCountess's joyous greeting of them, had rather providentially broken.\\nTwo days later Archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement\\nin the van der Luydens' favour, and had said to himself, with a touch\\nof tartness, that a lady who knew how to thank all-powerful elderly\\ngentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need\\neither the private consolations or the public championship of a young\\nman of his small compass.  To look at the matter in this light\\nsimplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim\\ndomestic virtues.  He could not picture May Welland, in whatever\\nconceivable emergency, hawking about her private difficulties and\\nlavishing her confidences on strange men; and she had never seemed to\\nhim finer or fairer than in the week that followed.  He had even\\nyielded to her wish for a long engagement, since she had found the one\\ndisarming answer to his plea for haste.\\n\\n\\\"You know, when it comes to the point, your parents have always let you\\nhave your way ever since you were a little girl,\\\" he argued; and she\\nhad answered, with her clearest look:  \\\"Yes; and that's what makes it\\nso hard to refuse the very last thing they'll ever ask of me as a\\nlittle girl.\\\"\\n\\nThat was the old New York note; that was the kind of answer he would\\nlike always to be sure of his wife's making.  If one had habitually\\nbreathed the New York air there were times when anything less\\ncrystalline seemed stifling.\\n\\n\\nThe papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact; but\\nthey plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered.\\nThey consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between Count Olenski's\\nsolicitors and a French legal firm to whom the Countess had applied for\\nthe settlement of her financial situation.  There was also a short\\nletter from the Count to his wife: after reading it, Newland Archer\\nrose, jammed the papers back into their envelope, and reentered Mr.\\nLetterblair's office.\\n\\n\\\"Here are the letters, sir.  If you wish, I'll see Madame Olenska,\\\" he\\nsaid in a constrained voice.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you--thank you, Mr. Archer.  Come and dine with me tonight if\\nyou're free, and we'll go into the matter afterward: in case you wish\\nto call on our client tomorrow.\\\"\\n\\nNewland Archer walked straight home again that afternoon.  It was a\\nwinter evening of transparent clearness, with an innocent young moon\\nabove the house-tops; and he wanted to fill his soul's lungs with the\\npure radiance, and not exchange a word with any one till he and Mr.\\nLetterblair were closeted together after dinner.  It was impossible to\\ndecide otherwise than he had done: he must see Madame Olenska himself\\nrather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes.  A great wave of\\ncompassion had swept away his indifference and impatience: she stood\\nbefore him as an exposed and pitiful figure, to be saved at all costs\\nfrom farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate.\\n\\nHe remembered what she had told him of Mrs. Welland's request to be\\nspared whatever was \\\"unpleasant\\\" in her history, and winced at the\\nthought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the New\\nYork air so pure.  \\\"Are we only Pharisees after all?\\\" he wondered,\\npuzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human\\nvileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty.\\n\\nFor the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had\\nalways been.  He passed for a young man who had not been afraid of\\nrisks, and he knew that his secret love-affair with poor silly Mrs.\\nThorley Rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming\\nair of adventure.  But Mrs. Rushworth was \\\"that kind of woman\\\";\\nfoolish, vain, clandestine by nature, and far more attracted by the\\nsecrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he\\npossessed.  When the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart, but\\nnow it seemed the redeeming feature of the case.  The affair, in short,\\nhad been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been\\nthrough, and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed\\nbelief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and\\nrespected and those one enjoyed--and pitied.  In this view they were\\nsedulously abetted by their mothers, aunts and other elderly female\\nrelatives, who all shared Mrs. Archer's belief that when \\\"such things\\nhappened\\\" it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always\\ncriminal of the woman.  All the elderly ladies whom Archer knew\\nregarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous\\nand designing, and mere simple-minded man as powerless in her clutches.\\nThe only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to\\nmarry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him.\\n\\nIn the complicated old European communities, Archer began to guess,\\nlove-problems might be less simple and less easily classified.  Rich\\nand idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such\\nsituations; and there might even be one in which a woman naturally\\nsensitive and aloof would yet, from the force of circumstances, from\\nsheer defencelessness and loneliness, be drawn into a tie inexcusable\\nby conventional standards.\\n\\nOn reaching home he wrote a line to the Countess Olenska, asking at\\nwhat hour of the next day she could receive him, and despatched it by a\\nmessenger-boy, who returned presently with a word to the effect that\\nshe was going to Skuytercliff the next morning to stay over Sunday with\\nthe van der Luydens, but that he would find her alone that evening\\nafter dinner.  The note was written on a rather untidy half-sheet,\\nwithout date or address, but her hand was firm and free.  He was amused\\nat the idea of her week-ending in the stately solitude of Skuytercliff,\\nbut immediately afterward felt that there, of all places, she would\\nmost feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the \\\"unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\n\\nHe was at Mr. Letterblair's punctually at seven, glad of the pretext\\nfor excusing himself soon after dinner.  He had formed his own opinion\\nfrom the papers entrusted to him, and did not especially want to go\\ninto the matter with his senior partner.  Mr. Letterblair was a\\nwidower, and they dined alone, copiously and slowly, in a dark shabby\\nroom hung with yellowing prints of \\\"The Death of Chatham\\\" and \\\"The\\nCoronation of Napoleon.\\\"  On the sideboard, between fluted Sheraton\\nknife-cases, stood a decanter of Haut Brion, and another of the old\\nLanning port (the gift of a client), which the wastrel Tom Lanning had\\nsold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in\\nSan Francisco--an incident less publicly humiliating to the family than\\nthe sale of the cellar.\\n\\nAfter a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers, then a young\\nbroiled turkey with corn fritters, followed by a canvas-back with\\ncurrant jelly and a celery mayonnaise.  Mr. Letterblair, who lunched on\\na sandwich and tea, dined deliberately and deeply, and insisted on his\\nguest's doing the same.  Finally, when the closing rites had been\\naccomplished, the cloth was removed, cigars were lit, and Mr.\\nLetterblair, leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward,\\nsaid, spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him:  \\\"The\\nwhole family are against a divorce.  And I think rightly.\\\"\\n\\nArcher instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument.  \\\"But\\nwhy, sir?  If there ever was a case--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--what's the use?  SHE'S here--he's there; the Atlantic's between\\nthem.  She'll never get back a dollar more of her money than what he's\\nvoluntarily returned to her: their damned heathen marriage settlements\\ntake precious good care of that.  As things go over there, Olenski's\\nacted generously: he might have turned her out without a penny.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man knew this and was silent.\\n\\n\\\"I understand, though,\\\" Mr. Letterblair continued, \\\"that she attaches\\nno importance to the money.  Therefore, as the family say, why not let\\nwell enough alone?\\\"\\n\\nArcher had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with Mr.\\nLetterblair's view; but put into words by this selfish, well-fed and\\nsupremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the Pharisaic voice of\\na society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant.\\n\\n\\\"I think that's for her to decide.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"H'm--have you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean the threat in her husband's letter?  What weight would that\\ncarry?  It's no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the\\nsuit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Unpleasant--!\\\" said Archer explosively.\\n\\nMr. Letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows, and the\\nyoung man, aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in\\nhis mind, bowed acquiescently while his senior continued:  \\\"Divorce is\\nalways unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You agree with me?\\\" Mr. Letterblair resumed, after a waiting silence.\\n\\n\\\"Naturally,\\\" said Archer.\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, I may count on you; the Mingotts may count on you; to use\\nyour influence against the idea?\\\"\\n\\nArcher hesitated.  \\\"I can't pledge myself till I've seen the Countess\\nOlenska,\\\" he said at length.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Archer, I don't understand you.  Do you want to marry into a\\nfamily with a scandalous divorce-suit hanging over it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think that has anything to do with the case.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young\\npartner a cautious and apprehensive gaze.\\n\\nArcher understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn,\\nand for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect.  Now that the job\\nhad been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it; and, to\\nguard against the possibility, he saw that he must reassure the\\nunimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the Mingotts.\\n\\n\\\"You may be sure, sir, that I shan't commit myself till I've reported\\nto you; what I meant was that I'd rather not give an opinion till I've\\nheard what Madame Olenska has to say.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of\\nthe best New York tradition, and the young man, glancing at his watch,\\npleaded an engagement and took leave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOld-fashioned New York dined at seven, and the habit of after-dinner\\ncalls, though derided in Archer's set, still generally prevailed.  As\\nthe young man strolled up Fifth Avenue from Waverley Place, the long\\nthoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before\\nthe Reggie Chiverses' (where there was a dinner for the Duke), and the\\noccasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler\\nascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas-lit hall.\\nThus, as Archer crossed Washington Square, he remarked that old Mr. du\\nLac was calling on his cousins the Dagonets, and turning down the\\ncorner of West Tenth Street he saw Mr. Skipworth, of his own firm,\\nobviously bound on a visit to the Miss Lannings.  A little farther up\\nFifth Avenue, Beaufort appeared on his doorstep, darkly projected\\nagainst a blaze of light, descended to his private brougham, and rolled\\naway to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination.  It was\\nnot an Opera night, and no one was giving a party, so that Beaufort's\\nouting was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature.  Archer connected it in\\nhis mind with a little house beyond Lexington Avenue in which\\nberibboned window curtains and flower-boxes had recently appeared, and\\nbefore whose newly painted door the canary-coloured brougham of Miss\\nFanny Ring was frequently seen to wait.\\n\\nBeyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed Mrs. Archer's\\nworld lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists, musicians\\nand \\\"people who wrote.\\\"  These scattered fragments of humanity had\\nnever shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure.  In\\nspite of odd ways they were said to be, for the most part, quite\\nrespectable; but they preferred to keep to themselves.  Medora Manson,\\nin her prosperous days, had inaugurated a \\\"literary salon\\\"; but it had\\nsoon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it.\\n\\nOthers had made the same attempt, and there was a household of\\nBlenkers--an intense and voluble mother, and three blowsy daughters who\\nimitated her--where one met Edwin Booth and Patti and William Winter,\\nand the new Shakespearian actor George Rignold, and some of the\\nmagazine editors and musical and literary critics.\\n\\nMrs. Archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these\\npersons.  They were odd, they were uncertain, they had things one\\ndidn't know about in the background of their lives and minds.\\nLiterature and art were deeply respected in the Archer set, and Mrs.\\nArcher was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable\\nand cultivated society had been when it included such figures as\\nWashington Irving, Fitz-Greene Halleck and the poet of \\\"The Culprit\\nFay.\\\" The most celebrated authors of that generation had been\\n\\\"gentlemen\\\"; perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had\\ngentlemanly sentiments, but their origin, their appearance, their hair,\\ntheir intimacy with the stage and the Opera, made any old New York\\ncriterion inapplicable to them.\\n\\n\\\"When I was a girl,\\\" Mrs. Archer used to say, \\\"we knew everybody\\nbetween the Battery and Canal Street; and only the people one knew had\\ncarriages.  It was perfectly easy to place any one then; now one can't\\ntell, and I prefer not to try.\\\"\\n\\nOnly old Catherine Mingott, with her absence of moral prejudices and\\nalmost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions, might have\\nbridged the abyss; but she had never opened a book or looked at a\\npicture, and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala\\nnights at the Italiens, in the days of her triumph at the Tuileries.\\nPossibly Beaufort, who was her match in daring, would have succeeded in\\nbringing about a fusion; but his grand house and silk-stockinged\\nfootmen were an obstacle to informal sociability.  Moreover, he was as\\nilliterate as old Mrs. Mingott, and considered \\\"fellows who wrote\\\" as\\nthe mere paid purveyors of rich men's pleasures; and no one rich enough\\nto influence his opinion had ever questioned it.\\n\\nNewland Archer had been aware of these things ever since he could\\nremember, and had accepted them as part of the structure of his\\nuniverse.  He knew that there were societies where painters and poets\\nand novelists and men of science, and even great actors, were as sought\\nafter as Dukes; he had often pictured to himself what it would have\\nbeen to live in the intimacy of drawing-rooms dominated by the talk of\\nMerimee (whose \\\"Lettres a une Inconnue\\\" was one of his inseparables),\\nof Thackeray, Browning or William Morris.  But such things were\\ninconceivable in New York, and unsettling to think of.  Archer knew\\nmost of the \\\"fellows who wrote,\\\" the musicians and the painters: he met\\nthem at the Century, or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that\\nwere beginning to come into existence.  He enjoyed them there, and was\\nbored with them at the Blenkers', where they were mingled with fervid\\nand dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities; and\\neven after his most exciting talks with Ned Winsett he always came away\\nwith the feeling that if his world was small, so was theirs, and that\\nthe only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where\\nthey would naturally merge.\\n\\nHe was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the\\nCountess Olenska had lived and suffered, and also--perhaps--tasted\\nmysterious joys.  He remembered with what amusement she had told him\\nthat her grandmother Mingott and the Wellands objected to her living in\\na \\\"Bohemian\\\" quarter given over to \\\"people who wrote.\\\"  It was not the\\nperil but the poverty that her family disliked; but that shade escaped\\nher, and she supposed they considered literature compromising.\\n\\nShe herself had no fears of it, and the books scattered about her\\ndrawing-room (a part of the house in which books were usually supposed\\nto be \\\"out of place\\\"), though chiefly works of fiction, had whetted\\nArcher's interest with such new names as those of Paul Bourget,\\nHuysmans, and the Goncourt brothers.  Ruminating on these things as he\\napproached her door, he was once more conscious of the curious way in\\nwhich she reversed his values, and of the need of thinking himself into\\nconditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be\\nof use in her present difficulty.\\n\\n\\nNastasia opened the door, smiling mysteriously.  On the bench in the\\nhall lay a sable-lined overcoat, a folded opera hat of dull silk with a\\ngold J. B. on the lining, and a white silk muffler: there was no\\nmistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of\\nJulius Beaufort.\\n\\nArcher was angry: so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his\\ncard and going away; then he remembered that in writing to Madame\\nOlenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he\\nwished to see her privately.  He had therefore no one but himself to\\nblame if she had opened her doors to other visitors; and he entered the\\ndrawing-room with the dogged determination to make Beaufort feel\\nhimself in the way, and to outstay him.\\n\\nThe banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf, which was draped with\\nan old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church\\ncandles of yellowish wax.  He had thrust his chest out, supporting his\\nshoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large\\npatent-leather foot.  As Archer entered he was smiling and looking down\\non his hostess, who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the\\nchimney.  A table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it, and\\nagainst the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as\\ntributes from the Beaufort hot-houses, Madame Olenska sat\\nhalf-reclined, her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving\\nthe arm bare to the elbow.\\n\\nIt was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were\\ncalled \\\"simple dinner dresses\\\": a close-fitting armour of whale-boned\\nsilk, slightly open in the neck, with lace ruffles filling in the\\ncrack, and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to\\nshow an Etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band.  But Madame Olenska,\\nheedless of tradition, was attired in a long robe of red velvet\\nbordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur.\\nArcher remembered, on his last visit to Paris, seeing a portrait by the\\nnew painter, Carolus Duran, whose pictures were the sensation of the\\nSalon, in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath-like robes with\\nher chin nestling in fur.  There was something perverse and provocative\\nin the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing-room, and\\nin the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms; but the effect\\nwas undeniably pleasing.\\n\\n\\\"Lord love us--three whole days at Skuytercliff!\\\" Beaufort was saying\\nin his loud sneering voice as Archer entered.  \\\"You'd better take all\\nyour furs, and a hot-water-bottle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?  Is the house so cold?\\\" she asked, holding out her left hand to\\nArcher in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss\\nit.\\n\\n\\\"No; but the missus is,\\\" said Beaufort, nodding carelessly to the young\\nman.\\n\\n\\\"But I thought her so kind.  She came herself to invite me. Granny says\\nI must certainly go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Granny would, of course.  And I say it's a shame you're going to miss\\nthe little oyster supper I'd planned for you at Delmonico's next\\nSunday, with Campanini and Scalchi and a lot of jolly people.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked doubtfully from the banker to Archer.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--that does tempt me!  Except the other evening at Mrs. Struthers's\\nI've not met a single artist since I've been here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What kind of artists?  I know one or two painters, very good fellows,\\nthat I could bring to see you if you'd allow me,\\\" said Archer boldly.\\n\\n\\\"Painters?  Are there painters in New York?\\\" asked Beaufort, in a tone\\nimplying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures;\\nand Madame Olenska said to Archer, with her grave smile:  \\\"That would\\nbe charming.  But I was really thinking of dramatic artists, singers,\\nactors, musicians.  My husband's house was always full of them.\\\"\\n\\nShe said the words \\\"my husband\\\" as if no sinister associations were\\nconnected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the\\nlost delights of her married life.  Archer looked at her perplexedly,\\nwondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to\\ntouch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her\\nreputation in order to break with it.\\n\\n\\\"I do think,\\\" she went on, addressing both men, \\\"that the imprevu adds\\nto one's enjoyment.  It's perhaps a mistake to see the same people\\nevery day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's confoundedly dull, anyhow; New York is dying of dullness,\\\"\\nBeaufort grumbled.  \\\"And when I try to liven it up for you, you go back\\non me.  Come--think better of it!  Sunday is your last chance, for\\nCampanini leaves next week for Baltimore and Philadelphia; and I've a\\nprivate room, and a Steinway, and they'll sing all night for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How delicious!  May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow\\nmorning?\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice.\\nBeaufort evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood\\nstaring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Why not now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's too serious a question to decide at this late hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you call it late?\\\"\\n\\nShe returned his glance coolly.  \\\"Yes; because I have still to talk\\nbusiness with Mr. Archer for a little while.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" Beaufort snapped.  There was no appeal from her tone, and with a\\nslight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed\\nwith a practised air, and calling out from the threshold:  \\\"I say,\\nNewland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town of course\\nyou're included in the supper,\\\" left the room with his heavy important\\nstep.\\n\\nFor a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair must have told her of\\nhis coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his\\nmind.\\n\\n\\\"You know painters, then?  You live in their milieu?\\\" she asked, her\\neyes full of interest.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, not exactly.  I don't know that the arts have a milieu here, any\\nof them; they're more like a very thinly settled outskirt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you care for such things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Immensely.  When I'm in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition.  I\\ntry to keep up.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from\\nher long draperies.\\n\\n\\\"I used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things.  But\\nnow I want to try not to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You want to try not to?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes: I want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody\\nelse here.\\\"\\n\\nArcher reddened.  \\\"You'll never be like everybody else,\\\" he said.\\n\\nShe raised her straight eyebrows a little.  \\\"Ah, don't say that.  If\\nyou knew how I hate to be different!\\\"\\n\\nHer face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask.  She leaned forward,\\nclasping her knee in her thin hands, and looking away from him into\\nremote dark distances.\\n\\n\\\"I want to get away from it all,\\\" she insisted.\\n\\nHe waited a moment and cleared his throat.  \\\"I know.  Mr. Letterblair\\nhas told me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's the reason I've come.  He asked me to--you see I'm in the firm.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked slightly surprised, and then her eyes brightened.  \\\"You mean\\nyou can manage it for me?  I can talk to you instead of Mr.\\nLetterblair?  Oh, that will be so much easier!\\\"\\n\\nHer tone touched him, and his confidence grew with his\\nself-satisfaction.  He perceived that she had spoken of business to\\nBeaufort simply to get rid of him; and to have routed Beaufort was\\nsomething of a triumph.\\n\\n\\\"I am here to talk about it,\\\" he repeated.\\n\\nShe sat silent, her head still propped by the arm that rested on the\\nback of the sofa.  Her face looked pale and extinguished, as if dimmed\\nby the rich red of her dress.  She struck Archer, of a sudden, as a\\npathetic and even pitiful figure.\\n\\n\\\"Now we're coming to hard facts,\\\" he thought, conscious in himself of\\nthe same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his\\nmother and her contemporaries.  How little practice he had had in\\ndealing with unusual situations!  Their very vocabulary was unfamiliar\\nto him, and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage.  In face of what\\nwas coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy.\\n\\nAfter a pause Madame Olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence:  \\\"I\\nwant to be free; I want to wipe out all the past.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I understand that.\\\"\\n\\nHer face warmed.  \\\"Then you'll help me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"First--\\\" he hesitated--\\\"perhaps I ought to know a little more.\\\"\\n\\nShe seemed surprised.  \\\"You know about my husband--my life with him?\\\"\\n\\nHe made a sign of assent.\\n\\n\\\"Well--then--what more is there?  In this country are such things\\ntolerated?  I'm a Protestant--our church does not forbid divorce in\\nsuch cases.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not.\\\"\\n\\nThey were both silent again, and Archer felt the spectre of Count\\nOlenski's letter grimacing hideously between them.  The letter filled\\nonly half a page, and was just what he had described it to be in\\nspeaking of it to Mr. Letterblair: the vague charge of an angry\\nblackguard.  But how much truth was behind it?  Only Count Olenski's\\nwife could tell.\\n\\n\\\"I've looked through the papers you gave to Mr. Letterblair,\\\" he said\\nat length.\\n\\n\\\"Well--can there be anything more abominable?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\nShe changed her position slightly, screening her eyes with her lifted\\nhand.\\n\\n\\\"Of course you know,\\\" Archer continued, \\\"that if your husband chooses\\nto fight the case--as he threatens to--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He can say things--things that might be unpl--might be disagreeable to\\nyou: say them publicly, so that they would get about, and harm you even\\nif--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean: no matter how unfounded they were.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused for a long interval; so long that, not wishing to keep his\\neyes on her shaded face, he had time to imprint on his mind the exact\\nshape of her other hand, the one on her knee, and every detail of the\\nthree rings on her fourth and fifth fingers; among which, he noticed, a\\nwedding ring did not appear.\\n\\n\\\"What harm could such accusations, even if he made them publicly, do me\\nhere?\\\"\\n\\nIt was on his lips to exclaim:  \\\"My poor child--far more harm than\\nanywhere else!\\\"  Instead, he answered, in a voice that sounded in his\\nears like Mr. Letterblair's: \\\"New York society is a very small world\\ncompared with the one you've lived in.  And it's ruled, in spite of\\nappearances, by a few people with--well, rather old-fashioned ideas.\\\"\\n\\nShe said nothing, and he continued:  \\\"Our ideas about marriage and\\ndivorce are particularly old-fashioned.  Our legislation favours\\ndivorce--our social customs don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--not if the woman, however injured, however irreproachable, has\\nappearances in the least degree against her, has exposed herself by any\\nunconventional action to--to offensive insinuations--\\\"\\n\\nShe drooped her head a little lower, and he waited again, intensely\\nhoping for a flash of indignation, or at least a brief cry of denial.\\nNone came.\\n\\nA little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow, and a log\\nbroke in two and sent up a shower of sparks.  The whole hushed and\\nbrooding room seemed to be waiting silently with Archer.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she murmured at length, \\\"that's what my family tell me.\\\"\\n\\nHe winced a little.  \\\"It's not unnatural--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"OUR family,\\\" she corrected herself; and Archer coloured.  \\\"For you'll\\nbe my cousin soon,\\\" she continued gently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you take their view?\\\"\\n\\nHe stood up at this, wandered across the room, stared with void eyes at\\none of the pictures against the old red damask, and came back\\nirresolutely to her side.  How could he say:  \\\"Yes, if what your\\nhusband hints is true, or if you've no way of disproving it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sincerely--\\\" she interjected, as he was about to speak.\\n\\nHe looked down into the fire.  \\\"Sincerely, then--what should you gain\\nthat would compensate for the possibility--the certainty--of a lot of\\nbeastly talk?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But my freedom--is that nothing?\\\"\\n\\nIt flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was\\ntrue, and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt.  How was he\\nto tell her that, if she really cherished such a plan, the laws of the\\nState were inexorably opposed to it?  The mere suspicion that the\\nthought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward\\nher.  \\\"But aren't you as free as air as it is?\\\" he returned.  \\\"Who can\\ntouch you?  Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been\\nsettled--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" she said indifferently.\\n\\n\\\"Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely\\ndisagreeable and painful?  Think of the newspapers--their vileness!\\nIt's all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can't make over society.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he\\nfelt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts.\\n\\n\\\"The individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is\\nsupposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention\\nthat keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are\\nany,\\\" he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his\\nlips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her\\nsilence seemed to have laid bare.  Since she would not or could not say\\nthe one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let\\nher feel that he was trying to probe into her secret.  Better keep on\\nthe surface, in the prudent old New York way, than risk uncovering a\\nwound he could not heal.\\n\\n\\\"It's my business, you know,\\\" he went on, \\\"to help you to see these\\nthings as the people who are fondest of you see them.  The Mingotts,\\nthe Wellands, the van der Luydens, all your friends and relations: if I\\ndidn't show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn't be\\nfair of me, would it?\\\"  He spoke insistently, almost pleading with her\\nin his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence.\\n\\nShe said slowly:  \\\"No; it wouldn't be fair.\\\"\\n\\nThe fire had crumbled down to greyness, and one of the lamps made a\\ngurgling appeal for attention.  Madame Olenska rose, wound it up and\\nreturned to the fire, but without resuming her seat.\\n\\nHer remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more\\nfor either of them to say, and Archer stood up also.\\n\\n\\\"Very well; I will do what you wish,\\\" she said abruptly.  The blood\\nrushed to his forehead; and, taken aback by the suddenness of her\\nsurrender, he caught her two hands awkwardly in his.\\n\\n\\\"I--I do want to help you,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"You do help me.  Good night, my cousin.\\\"\\n\\nHe bent and laid his lips on her hands, which were cold and lifeless.\\nShe drew them away, and he turned to the door, found his coat and hat\\nunder the faint gas-light of the hall, and plunged out into the winter\\nnight bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a crowded night at Wallack's theatre.\\n\\nThe play was \\\"The Shaughraun,\\\" with Dion Boucicault in the title role\\nand Harry Montague and Ada Dyas as the lovers.  The popularity of the\\nadmirable English company was at its height, and the Shaughraun always\\npacked the house.  In the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved; in\\nthe stalls and boxes, people smiled a little at the hackneyed\\nsentiments and clap-trap situations, and enjoyed the play as much as\\nthe galleries did.\\n\\nThere was one episode, in particular, that held the house from floor to\\nceiling.  It was that in which Harry Montague, after a sad, almost\\nmonosyllabic scene of parting with Miss Dyas, bade her good-bye, and\\nturned to go.  The actress, who was standing near the mantelpiece and\\nlooking down into the fire, wore a gray cashmere dress without\\nfashionable loopings or trimmings, moulded to her tall figure and\\nflowing in long lines about her feet.  Around her neck was a narrow\\nblack velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back.\\n\\nWhen her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the\\nmantel-shelf and bowed her face in her hands.  On the threshold he\\npaused to look at her; then he stole back, lifted one of the ends of\\nvelvet ribbon, kissed it, and left the room without her hearing him or\\nchanging her attitude.  And on this silent parting the curtain fell.\\n\\nIt was always for the sake of that particular scene that Newland Archer\\nwent to see \\\"The Shaughraun.\\\" He thought the adieux of Montague and Ada\\nDyas as fine as anything he had ever seen Croisette and Bressant do in\\nParis, or Madge Robertson and Kendal in London; in its reticence, its\\ndumb sorrow, it moved him more than the most famous histrionic\\noutpourings.\\n\\nOn the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy\\nby reminding him--he could not have said why--of his leave-taking from\\nMadame Olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier.\\n\\nIt would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the\\ntwo situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned.\\nNewland Archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young\\nEnglish actor's romantic good looks, and Miss Dyas was a tall\\nred-haired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly\\nface was utterly unlike Ellen Olenska's vivid countenance.  Nor were\\nArcher and Madame Olenska two lovers parting in heart-broken silence;\\nthey were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the\\nlawyer the worst possible impression of the client's case.  Wherein,\\nthen, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a\\nkind of retrospective excitement?  It seemed to be in Madame Olenska's\\nmysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities\\noutside the daily run of experience.  She had hardly ever said a word\\nto him to produce this impression, but it was a part of her, either a\\nprojection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something\\ninherently dramatic, passionate and unusual in herself.  Archer had\\nalways been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a\\nsmall part in shaping people's lots compared with their innate tendency\\nto have things happen to them.  This tendency he had felt from the\\nfirst in Madame Olenska.  The quiet, almost passive young woman struck\\nhim as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen,\\nno matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to\\navoid them.  The exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so\\nthick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently\\npassed unperceived.  It was precisely the odd absence of surprise in\\nher that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very\\nmaelstrom: the things she took for granted gave the measure of those\\nshe had rebelled against.\\n\\nArcher had left her with the conviction that Count Olenski's accusation\\nwas not unfounded.  The mysterious person who figured in his wife's\\npast as \\\"the secretary\\\" had probably not been unrewarded for his share\\nin her escape.  The conditions from which she had fled were\\nintolerable, past speaking of, past believing: she was young, she was\\nfrightened, she was desperate--what more natural than that she should\\nbe grateful to her rescuer?  The pity was that her gratitude put her,\\nin the law's eyes and the world's, on a par with her abominable\\nhusband.  Archer had made her understand this, as he was bound to do;\\nhe had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly New York, on\\nwhose larger charity she had apparently counted, was precisely the\\nplace where she could least hope for indulgence.\\n\\nTo have to make this fact plain to her--and to witness her resigned\\nacceptance of it--had been intolerably painful to him.  He felt himself\\ndrawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity, as if her\\ndumbly-confessed error had put her at his mercy, humbling yet endearing\\nher.  He was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret, rather\\nthan to the cold scrutiny of Mr. Letterblair, or the embarrassed gaze\\nof her family.  He immediately took it upon himself to assure them both\\nthat she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce, basing her\\ndecision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the\\nproceeding; and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes\\nfrom the \\\"unpleasantness\\\" she had spared them.\\n\\n\\\"I was sure Newland would manage it,\\\" Mrs. Welland had said proudly of\\nher future son-in-law; and old Mrs. Mingott, who had summoned him for a\\nconfidential interview, had congratulated him on his cleverness, and\\nadded impatiently:  \\\"Silly goose!  I told her myself what nonsense it\\nwas.  Wanting to pass herself off as Ellen Mingott and an old maid,\\nwhen she has the luck to be a married woman and a Countess!\\\"\\n\\nThese incidents had made the memory of his last talk with Madame\\nOlenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the\\nparting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears, and he stood up\\nto leave the theatre.\\n\\nIn doing so, he turned to the side of the house behind him, and saw the\\nlady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the Beauforts,\\nLawrence Lefferts and one or two other men.  He had not spoken with her\\nalone since their evening together, and had tried to avoid being with\\nher in company; but now their eyes met, and as Mrs. Beaufort recognised\\nhim at the same time, and made her languid little gesture of\\ninvitation, it was impossible not to go into the box.\\n\\nBeaufort and Lefferts made way for him, and after a few words with Mrs.\\nBeaufort, who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk,\\nArcher seated himself behind Madame Olenska.  There was no one else in\\nthe box but Mr. Sillerton Jackson, who was telling Mrs. Beaufort in a\\nconfidential undertone about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's last Sunday\\nreception (where some people reported that there had been dancing).\\nUnder cover of this circumstantial narrative, to which Mrs. Beaufort\\nlistened with her perfect smile, and her head at just the right angle\\nto be seen in profile from the stalls, Madame Olenska turned and spoke\\nin a low voice.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think,\\\" she asked, glancing toward the stage, \\\"he will send her\\na bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning?\\\"\\n\\nArcher reddened, and his heart gave a leap of surprise.  He had called\\nonly twice on Madame Olenska, and each time he had sent her a box of\\nyellow roses, and each time without a card.  She had never before made\\nany allusion to the flowers, and he supposed she had never thought of\\nhim as the sender.  Now her sudden recognition of the gift, and her\\nassociating it with the tender leave-taking on the stage, filled him\\nwith an agitated pleasure.\\n\\n\\\"I was thinking of that too--I was going to leave the theatre in order\\nto take the picture away with me,\\\" he said.\\n\\nTo his surprise her colour rose, reluctantly and duskily.  She looked\\ndown at the mother-of-pearl opera-glass in her smoothly gloved hands,\\nand said, after a pause: \\\"What do you do while May is away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I stick to my work,\\\" he answered, faintly annoyed by the question.\\n\\nIn obedience to a long-established habit, the Wellands had left the\\nprevious week for St. Augustine, where, out of regard for the supposed\\nsusceptibility of Mr. Welland's bronchial tubes, they always spent the\\nlatter part of the winter.  Mr. Welland was a mild and silent man, with\\nno opinions but with many habits.  With these habits none might\\ninterfere; and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should\\nalways go with him on his annual journey to the south.  To preserve an\\nunbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind; he would not\\nhave known where his hair-brushes were, or how to provide stamps for\\nhis letters, if Mrs. Welland had not been there to tell him.\\n\\nAs all the members of the family adored each other, and as Mr. Welland\\nwas the central object of their idolatry, it never occurred to his wife\\nand May to let him go to St. Augustine alone; and his sons, who were\\nboth in the law, and could not leave New York during the winter, always\\njoined him for Easter and travelled back with him.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Archer to discuss the necessity of May's\\naccompanying her father.  The reputation of the Mingotts' family\\nphysician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which Mr.\\nWelland had never had; and his insistence on St. Augustine was\\ntherefore inflexible.  Originally, it had been intended that May's\\nengagement should not be announced till her return from Florida, and\\nthe fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to\\nalter Mr. Welland's plans.  Archer would have liked to join the\\ntravellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his\\nbetrothed; but he too was bound by custom and conventions.  Little\\narduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted\\nof frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a\\nholiday in mid-winter; and he accepted May's departure with the\\nresignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal\\nconstituents of married life.\\n\\nHe was conscious that Madame Olenska was looking at him under lowered\\nlids.  \\\"I have done what you wished--what you advised,\\\" she said\\nabruptly.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--I'm glad,\\\" he returned, embarrassed by her broaching the subject\\nat such a moment.\\n\\n\\\"I understand--that you were right,\\\" she went on a little breathlessly;\\n\\\"but sometimes life is difficult ...  perplexing...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I wanted to tell you that I DO feel you were right; and that I'm\\ngrateful to you,\\\" she ended, lifting her opera-glass quickly to her\\neyes as the door of the box opened and Beaufort's resonant voice broke\\nin on them.\\n\\nArcher stood up, and left the box and the theatre.\\n\\nOnly the day before he had received a letter from May Welland in which,\\nwith characteristic candour, she had asked him to \\\"be kind to Ellen\\\" in\\ntheir absence.  \\\"She likes you and admires you so much--and you know,\\nthough she doesn't show it, she's still very lonely and unhappy.  I\\ndon't think Granny understands her, or uncle Lovell Mingott either;\\nthey really think she's much worldlier and fonder of society than she\\nis.  And I can quite see that New York must seem dull to her, though\\nthe family won't admit it.  I think she's been used to lots of things\\nwe haven't got; wonderful music, and picture shows, and\\ncelebrities--artists and authors and all the clever people you admire.\\nGranny can't understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and\\nclothes--but I can see that you're almost the only person in New York\\nwho can talk to her about what she really cares for.\\\"\\n\\nHis wise May--how he had loved her for that letter!  But he had not\\nmeant to act on it; he was too busy, to begin with, and he did not\\ncare, as an engaged man, to play too conspicuously the part of Madame\\nOlenska's champion.  He had an idea that she knew how to take care of\\nherself a good deal better than the ingenuous May imagined.  She had\\nBeaufort at her feet, Mr. van der Luyden hovering above her like a\\nprotecting deity, and any number of candidates (Lawrence Lefferts among\\nthem) waiting their opportunity in the middle distance.  Yet he never\\nsaw her, or exchanged a word with her, without feeling that, after all,\\nMay's ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination.  Ellen\\nOlenska was lonely and she was unhappy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he came out into the lobby Archer ran across his friend Ned Winsett,\\nthe only one among what Janey called his \\\"clever people\\\" with whom he\\ncared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of\\nclub and chop-house banter.\\n\\nHe had caught sight, across the house, of Winsett's shabby\\nround-shouldered back, and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the\\nBeaufort box.  The two men shook hands, and Winsett proposed a bock at\\na little German restaurant around the corner.  Archer, who was not in\\nthe mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there, declined\\non the plea that he had work to do at home; and Winsett said:  \\\"Oh,\\nwell so have I for that matter, and I'll be the Industrious Apprentice\\ntoo.\\\"\\n\\nThey strolled along together, and presently Winsett said:  \\\"Look here,\\nwhat I'm really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of\\nyours--with the Beauforts, wasn't she?  The one your friend Lefferts\\nseems so smitten by.\\\"\\n\\nArcher, he could not have said why, was slightly annoyed.  What the\\ndevil did Ned Winsett want with Ellen Olenska's name?  And above all,\\nwhy did he couple it with Lefferts's?  It was unlike Winsett to\\nmanifest such curiosity; but after all, Archer remembered, he was a\\njournalist.\\n\\n\\\"It's not for an interview, I hope?\\\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Well--not for the press; just for myself,\\\" Winsett rejoined.  \\\"The\\nfact is she's a neighbour of mine--queer quarter for such a beauty to\\nsettle in--and she's been awfully kind to my little boy, who fell down\\nher area chasing his kitten, and gave himself a nasty cut.  She rushed\\nin bareheaded, carrying him in her arms, with his knee all beautifully\\nbandaged, and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too\\ndazzled to ask her name.\\\"\\n\\nA pleasant glow dilated Archer's heart.  There was nothing\\nextraordinary in the tale: any woman would have done as much for a\\nneighbour's child.  But it was just like Ellen, he felt, to have rushed\\nin bareheaded, carrying the boy in her arms, and to have dazzled poor\\nMrs. Winsett into forgetting to ask who she was.\\n\\n\\\"That is the Countess Olenska--a granddaughter of old Mrs. Mingott's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whew--a Countess!\\\" whistled Ned Winsett.  \\\"Well, I didn't know\\nCountesses were so neighbourly.  Mingotts ain't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They would be, if you'd let them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well--\\\"  It was their old interminable argument as to the\\nobstinate unwillingness of the \\\"clever people\\\" to frequent the\\nfashionable, and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder,\\\" Winsett broke off, \\\"how a Countess happens to live in our\\nslum?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because she doesn't care a hang about where she lives--or about any of\\nour little social sign-posts,\\\" said Archer, with a secret pride in his\\nown picture of her.\\n\\n\\\"H'm--been in bigger places, I suppose,\\\" the other commented.  \\\"Well,\\nhere's my corner.\\\"\\n\\nHe slouched off across Broadway, and Archer stood looking after him and\\nmusing on his last words.\\n\\nNed Winsett had those flashes of penetration; they were the most\\ninteresting thing about him, and always made Archer wonder why they had\\nallowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are\\nstill struggling.\\n\\nArcher had known that Winsett had a wife and child, but he had never\\nseen them.  The two men always met at the Century, or at some haunt of\\njournalists and theatrical people, such as the restaurant where Winsett\\nhad proposed to go for a bock.  He had given Archer to understand that\\nhis wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might\\nmerely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes,\\nor in both.  Winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social\\nobservances: Archer, who dressed in the evening because he thought it\\ncleaner and more comfortable to do so, and who had never stopped to\\nconsider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in\\na modest budget, regarded Winsett's attitude as part of the boring\\n\\\"Bohemian\\\" pose that always made fashionable people, who changed their\\nclothes without talking about it, and were not forever harping on the\\nnumber of servants one kept, seem so much simpler and less\\nself-conscious than the others.  Nevertheless, he was always stimulated\\nby Winsett, and whenever he caught sight of the journalist's lean\\nbearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner\\nand carry him off for a long talk.\\n\\nWinsett was not a journalist by choice.  He was a pure man of letters,\\nuntimely born in a world that had no need of letters; but after\\npublishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations, of\\nwhich one hundred and twenty copies were sold, thirty given away, and\\nthe balance eventually destroyed by the publishers (as per contract) to\\nmake room for more marketable material, he had abandoned his real\\ncalling, and taken a sub-editorial job on a women's weekly, where\\nfashion-plates and paper patterns alternated with New England\\nlove-stories and advertisements of temperance drinks.\\n\\nOn the subject of \\\"Hearth-fires\\\" (as the paper was called) he was\\ninexhaustibly entertaining; but beneath his fun lurked the sterile\\nbitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up.  His\\nconversation always made Archer take the measure of his own life, and\\nfeel how little it contained; but Winsett's, after all, contained still\\nless, and though their common fund of intellectual interests and\\ncuriosities made their talks exhilarating, their exchange of views\\nusually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism.\\n\\n\\\"The fact is, life isn't much a fit for either of us,\\\" Winsett had once\\nsaid.  \\\"I'm down and out; nothing to be done about it.  I've got only\\none ware to produce, and there's no market for it here, and won't be in\\nmy time.  But you're free and you're well-off.  Why don't you get into\\ntouch?  There's only one way to do it: to go into politics.\\\"\\n\\nArcher threw his head back and laughed.  There one saw at a flash the\\nunbridgeable difference between men like Winsett and the\\nothers--Archer's kind.  Every one in polite circles knew that, in\\nAmerica, \\\"a gentleman couldn't go into politics.\\\"  But, since he could\\nhardly put it in that way to Winsett, he answered evasively: \\\"Look at\\nthe career of the honest man in American politics!  They don't want us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who's 'they'?  Why don't you all get together and be 'they'\\nyourselves?\\\"\\n\\nArcher's laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile.\\nIt was useless to prolong the discussion: everybody knew the melancholy\\nfate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal\\nor state politics in New York.  The day was past when that sort of\\nthing was possible: the country was in possession of the bosses and the\\nemigrant, and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture.\\n\\n\\\"Culture!  Yes--if we had it!  But there are just a few little local\\npatches, dying out here and there for lack of--well, hoeing and\\ncross-fertilising: the last remnants of the old European tradition that\\nyour forebears brought with them.  But you're in a pitiful little\\nminority: you've got no centre, no competition, no audience.  You're\\nlike the pictures on the walls of a deserted house:  'The Portrait of a\\nGentleman.'  You'll never amount to anything, any of you, till you roll\\nup your sleeves and get right down into the muck.  That, or emigrate\\n... God!  If I could emigrate ...\\\"\\n\\nArcher mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back\\nto books, where Winsett, if uncertain, was always interesting.\\nEmigrate!  As if a gentleman could abandon his own country!  One could\\nno more do that than one could roll up one's sleeves and go down into\\nthe muck.  A gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained.  But you\\ncouldn't make a man like Winsett see that; and that was why the New\\nYork of literary clubs and exotic restaurants, though a first shake\\nmade it seem more of a kaleidoscope, turned out, in the end, to be a\\nsmaller box, with a more monotonous pattern, than the assembled atoms\\nof Fifth Avenue.\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses.\\nIn consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived\\nthat his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was\\nfilled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.\\nWhy should he not be, at that moment, on the sands of St. Augustine\\nwith May Welland?  No one was deceived by his pretense of professional\\nactivity.  In old-fashioned legal firms like that of which Mr.\\nLetterblair was the head, and which were mainly engaged in the\\nmanagement of large estates and \\\"conservative\\\" investments, there were\\nalways two or three young men, fairly well-off, and without\\nprofessional ambition, who, for a certain number of hours of each day,\\nsat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks, or simply reading the\\nnewspapers.  Though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an\\noccupation, the crude fact of money-making was still regarded as\\nderogatory, and the law, being a profession, was accounted a more\\ngentlemanly pursuit than business.  But none of these young men had\\nmuch hope of really advancing in his profession, or any earnest desire\\nto do so; and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was\\nalready perceptibly spreading.\\n\\nIt made Archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too.\\nHe had, to be sure, other tastes and interests; he spent his vacations\\nin European travel, cultivated the \\\"clever people\\\" May spoke of, and\\ngenerally tried to \\\"keep up,\\\" as he had somewhat wistfully put it to\\nMadame Olenska.  But once he was married, what would become of this\\nnarrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?  He had\\nseen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream, though\\nperhaps less ardently, and who had gradually sunk into the placid and\\nluxurious routine of their elders.\\n\\nFrom the office he sent a note by messenger to Madame Olenska, asking\\nif he might call that afternoon, and begging her to let him find a\\nreply at his club; but at the club he found nothing, nor did he receive\\nany letter the following day.  This unexpected silence mortified him\\nbeyond reason, and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of\\nyellow roses behind a florist's window-pane, he left it there.  It was\\nonly on the third morning that he received a line by post from the\\nCountess Olenska.  To his surprise it was dated from Skuytercliff,\\nwhither the van der Luydens had promptly retreated after putting the\\nDuke on board his steamer.\\n\\n\\\"I ran away,\\\" the writer began abruptly (without the usual\\npreliminaries), \\\"the day after I saw you at the play, and these kind\\nfriends have taken me in.  I wanted to be quiet, and think things over.\\nYou were right in telling me how kind they were; I feel myself so safe\\nhere.  I wish that you were with us.\\\"  She ended with a conventional\\n\\\"Yours sincerely,\\\" and without any allusion to the date of her return.\\n\\nThe tone of the note surprised the young man.  What was Madame Olenska\\nrunning away from, and why did she feel the need to be safe?  His first\\nthought was of some dark menace from abroad; then he reflected that he\\ndid not know her epistolary style, and that it might run to picturesque\\nexaggeration.  Women always exaggerated; and moreover she was not\\nwholly at her ease in English, which she often spoke as if she were\\ntranslating from the French.  \\\"Je me suis evadee--\\\" put in that way,\\nthe opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have\\nwanted to escape from a boring round of engagements; which was very\\nlikely true, for he judged her to be capricious, and easily wearied of\\nthe pleasure of the moment.\\n\\nIt amused him to think of the van der Luydens' having carried her off\\nto Skuytercliff on a second visit, and this time for an indefinite\\nperiod.  The doors of Skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to\\nvisitors, and a chilly week-end was the most ever offered to the few\\nthus privileged.  But Archer had seen, on his last visit to Paris, the\\ndelicious play of Labiche, \\\"Le Voyage de M. Perrichon,\\\" and he\\nremembered M.  Perrichon's dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the\\nyoung man whom he had pulled out of the glacier.  The van der Luydens\\nhad rescued Madame Olenska from a doom almost as icy; and though there\\nwere many other reasons for being attracted to her, Archer knew that\\nbeneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on\\nrescuing her.\\n\\nHe felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away; and\\nalmost immediately remembered that, only the day before, he had refused\\nan invitation to spend the following Sunday with the Reggie Chiverses\\nat their house on the Hudson, a few miles below Skuytercliff.\\n\\nHe had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at Highbank,\\nwith coasting, ice-boating, sleighing, long tramps in the snow, and a\\ngeneral flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes.  He had\\njust received a box of new books from his London book-seller, and had\\npreferred the prospect of a quiet Sunday at home with his spoils.  But\\nhe now went into the club writing-room, wrote a hurried telegram, and\\ntold the servant to send it immediately.  He knew that Mrs. Reggie\\ndidn't object to her visitors' suddenly changing their minds, and that\\nthere was always a room to spare in her elastic house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNewland Archer arrived at the Chiverses' on Friday evening, and on\\nSaturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a\\nweek-end at Highbank.\\n\\nIn the morning he had a spin in the ice-boat with his hostess and a few\\nof the hardier guests; in the afternoon he \\\"went over the farm\\\" with\\nReggie, and listened, in the elaborately appointed stables, to long and\\nimpressive disquisitions on the horse; after tea he talked in a corner\\nof the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself\\nbroken-hearted when his engagement was announced, but was now eager to\\ntell him of her own matrimonial hopes; and finally, about midnight, he\\nassisted in putting a gold-fish in one visitor's bed, dressed up a\\nburglar in the bath-room of a nervous aunt, and saw in the small hours\\nby joining in a pillow-fight that ranged from the nurseries to the\\nbasement.  But on Sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter, and drove\\nover to Skuytercliff.\\n\\nPeople had always been told that the house at Skuytercliff was an\\nItalian villa.  Those who had never been to Italy believed it; so did\\nsome who had.  The house had been built by Mr. van der Luyden in his\\nyouth, on his return from the \\\"grand tour,\\\" and in anticipation of his\\napproaching marriage with Miss Louisa Dagonet.  It was a large square\\nwooden structure, with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and\\nwhite, a Corinthian portico, and fluted pilasters between the windows.\\nFrom the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by\\nbalustrades and urns descended in the steel-engraving style to a small\\nirregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers.\\nTo the right and left, the famous weedless lawns studded with\\n\\\"specimen\\\" trees (each of a different variety) rolled away to long\\nranges of grass crested with elaborate cast-iron ornaments; and below,\\nin a hollow, lay the four-roomed stone house which the first Patroon\\nhad built on the land granted him in 1612.\\n\\nAgainst the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the\\nItalian villa loomed up rather grimly; even in summer it kept its\\ndistance, and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than\\nthirty feet from its awful front.  Now, as Archer rang the bell, the\\nlong tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum; and the surprise of the\\nbutler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he\\nhad been summoned from his final sleep.\\n\\nHappily Archer was of the family, and therefore, irregular though his\\narrival was, entitled to be informed that the Countess Olenska was out,\\nhaving driven to afternoon service with Mrs. van der Luyden exactly\\nthree quarters of an hour earlier.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. van der Luyden,\\\" the butler continued, \\\"is in, sir; but my\\nimpression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading\\nyesterday's Evening Post.  I heard him say, sir, on his return from\\nchurch this morning, that he intended to look through the Evening Post\\nafter luncheon; if you like, sir, I might go to the library door and\\nlisten--\\\"\\n\\nBut Archer, thanking him, said that he would go and meet the ladies;\\nand the butler, obviously relieved, closed the door on him majestically.\\n\\nA groom took the cutter to the stables, and Archer struck through the\\npark to the high-road.  The village of Skuytercliff was only a mile and\\na half away, but he knew that Mrs. van der Luyden never walked, and\\nthat he must keep to the road to meet the carriage.  Presently,\\nhowever, coming down a foot-path that crossed the highway, he caught\\nsight of a slight figure in a red cloak, with a big dog running ahead.\\nHe hurried forward, and Madame Olenska stopped short with a smile of\\nwelcome.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you've come!\\\" she said, and drew her hand from her muff.\\n\\nThe red cloak made her look gay and vivid, like the Ellen Mingott of\\nold days; and he laughed as he took her hand, and answered:  \\\"I came to\\nsee what you were running away from.\\\"\\n\\nHer face clouded over, but she answered:  \\\"Ah, well--you will see,\\npresently.\\\"\\n\\nThe answer puzzled him.  \\\"Why--do you mean that you've been overtaken?\\\"\\n\\nShe shrugged her shoulders, with a little movement like Nastasia's, and\\nrejoined in a lighter tone:  \\\"Shall we walk on?  I'm so cold after the\\nsermon.  And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?\\\"\\n\\nThe blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak.\\n\\\"Ellen--what is it?  You must tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, presently--let's run a race first: my feet are freezing to the\\nground,\\\" she cried; and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the\\nsnow, the dog leaping about her with challenging barks.  For a moment\\nArcher stood watching, his gaze delighted by the flash of the red\\nmeteor against the snow; then he started after her, and they met,\\npanting and laughing, at a wicket that led into the park.\\n\\nShe looked up at him and smiled.  \\\"I knew you'd come!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That shows you wanted me to,\\\" he returned, with a disproportionate joy\\nin their nonsense.  The white glitter of the trees filled the air with\\nits own mysterious brightness, and as they walked on over the snow the\\nground seemed to sing under their feet.\\n\\n\\\"Where did you come from?\\\" Madame Olenska asked.\\n\\nHe told her, and added:  \\\"It was because I got your note.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a pause she said, with a just perceptible chill in her voice:\\n\\\"May asked you to take care of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't need any asking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean--I'm so evidently helpless and defenceless?  What a poor\\nthing you must all think me!  But women here seem not--seem never to\\nfeel the need: any more than the blessed in heaven.\\\"\\n\\nHe lowered his voice to ask:  \\\"What sort of a need?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, don't ask me!  I don't speak your language,\\\" she retorted\\npetulantly.\\n\\nThe answer smote him like a blow, and he stood still in the path,\\nlooking down at her.\\n\\n\\\"What did I come for, if I don't speak yours?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my friend--!\\\"  She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and he\\npleaded earnestly:  \\\"Ellen--why won't you tell me what's happened?\\\"\\n\\nShe shrugged again.  \\\"Does anything ever happen in heaven?\\\"\\n\\nHe was silent, and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a\\nword.  Finally she said:  \\\"I will tell you--but where, where, where?\\nOne can't be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house, with\\nall the doors wide open, and always a servant bringing tea, or a log\\nfor the fire, or the newspaper!  Is there nowhere in an American house\\nwhere one may be by one's self?  You're so shy, and yet you're so\\npublic.  I always feel as if I were in the convent again--or on the\\nstage, before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you don't like us!\\\" Archer exclaimed.\\n\\nThey were walking past the house of the old Patroon, with its squat\\nwalls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central\\nchimney.  The shutters stood wide, and through one of the newly-washed\\nwindows Archer caught the light of a fire.\\n\\n\\\"Why--the house is open!\\\" he said.\\n\\nShe stood still.  \\\"No; only for today, at least.  I wanted to see it,\\nand Mr. van der Luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened, so that\\nwe might stop there on the way back from church this morning.\\\"  She ran\\nup the steps and tried the door.  \\\"It's still unlocked--what luck!\\nCome in and we can have a quiet talk.  Mrs. van der Luyden has driven\\nover to see her old aunts at Rhinebeck and we shan't be missed at the\\nhouse for another hour.\\\"\\n\\nHe followed her into the narrow passage.  His spirits, which had\\ndropped at her last words, rose with an irrational leap.  The homely\\nlittle house stood there, its panels and brasses shining in the\\nfirelight, as if magically created to receive them.  A big bed of\\nembers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney, under an iron pot hung\\nfrom an ancient crane.  Rush-bottomed arm-chairs faced each other\\nacross the tiled hearth, and rows of Delft plates stood on shelves\\nagainst the walls.  Archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers.\\n\\nMadame Olenska, dropping her cloak, sat down in one of the chairs.\\nArcher leaned against the chimney and looked at her.\\n\\n\\\"You're laughing now; but when you wrote me you were unhappy,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"  She paused.  \\\"But I can't feel unhappy when you're here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I sha'n't be here long,\\\" he rejoined, his lips stiffening with the\\neffort to say just so much and no more.\\n\\n\\\"No; I know.  But I'm improvident: I live in the moment when I'm happy.\\\"\\n\\nThe words stole through him like a temptation, and to close his senses\\nto it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black\\ntree-boles against the snow.  But it was as if she too had shifted her\\nplace, and he still saw her, between himself and the trees, drooping\\nover the fire with her indolent smile.  Archer's heart was beating\\ninsubordinately.  What if it were from him that she had been running\\naway, and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone\\ntogether in this secret room?\\n\\n\\\"Ellen, if I'm really a help to you--if you really wanted me to\\ncome--tell me what's wrong, tell me what it is you're running away\\nfrom,\\\" he insisted.\\n\\nHe spoke without shifting his position, without even turning to look at\\nher: if the thing was to happen, it was to happen in this way, with the\\nwhole width of the room between them, and his eyes still fixed on the\\nouter snow.\\n\\nFor a long moment she was silent; and in that moment Archer imagined\\nher, almost heard her, stealing up behind him to throw her light arms\\nabout his neck.  While he waited, soul and body throbbing with the\\nmiracle to come, his eyes mechanically received the image of a\\nheavily-coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing\\nalong the path to the house.  The man was Julius Beaufort.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--!\\\" Archer cried, bursting into a laugh.\\n\\nMadame Olenska had sprung up and moved to his side, slipping her hand\\ninto his; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she\\nshrank back.\\n\\n\\\"So that was it?\\\" Archer said derisively.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't know he was here,\\\" Madame Olenska murmured.  Her hand still\\nclung to Archer's; but he drew away from her, and walking out into the\\npassage threw open the door of the house.\\n\\n\\\"Hallo, Beaufort--this way!  Madame Olenska was expecting you,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\nDuring his journey back to New York the next morning, Archer relived\\nwith a fatiguing vividness his last moments at Skuytercliff.\\n\\nBeaufort, though clearly annoyed at finding him with Madame Olenska,\\nhad, as usual, carried off the situation high-handedly.  His way of\\nignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them,\\nif they were sensitive to it, a feeling of invisibility, of\\nnonexistence.  Archer, as the three strolled back through the park, was\\naware of this odd sense of disembodiment; and humbling as it was to his\\nvanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved.\\n\\nBeaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance;\\nbut he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes.  It was\\nfairly clear that Madame Olenska had not known that he was coming,\\nthough her words to Archer had hinted at the possibility; at any rate,\\nshe had evidently not told him where she was going when she left New\\nYork, and her unexplained departure had exasperated him.  The\\nostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery, the very night\\nbefore, of a \\\"perfect little house,\\\" not in the market, which was\\nreally just the thing for her, but would be snapped up instantly if she\\ndidn't take it; and he was loud in mock-reproaches for the dance she\\nhad led him in running away just as he had found it.\\n\\n\\\"If only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit\\nnearer perfection I might have told you all this from town, and been\\ntoasting my toes before the club fire at this minute, instead of\\ntramping after you through the snow,\\\" he grumbled, disguising a real\\nirritation under the pretence of it; and at this opening Madame Olenska\\ntwisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one\\nday actually converse with each other from street to street, or\\neven--incredible dream!--from one town to another.  This struck from\\nall three allusions to Edgar Poe and Jules Verne, and such platitudes\\nas naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are\\ntalking against time, and dealing with a new invention in which it\\nwould seem ingenuous to believe too soon; and the question of the\\ntelephone carried them safely back to the big house.\\n\\nMrs. van der Luyden had not yet returned; and Archer took his leave and\\nwalked off to fetch the cutter, while Beaufort followed the Countess\\nOlenska indoors.  It was probable that, little as the van der Luydens\\nencouraged unannounced visits, he could count on being asked to dine,\\nand sent back to the station to catch the nine o'clock train; but more\\nthan that he would certainly not get, for it would be inconceivable to\\nhis hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to\\nspend the night, and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with\\nwhom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as Beaufort.\\n\\nBeaufort knew all this, and must have foreseen it; and his taking the\\nlong journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience.\\nHe was undeniably in pursuit of the Countess Olenska; and Beaufort had\\nonly one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women.  His dull and\\nchildless home had long since palled on him; and in addition to more\\npermanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in\\nhis own set.  This was the man from whom Madame Olenska was avowedly\\nflying: the question was whether she had fled because his importunities\\ndispleased her, or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist\\nthem; unless, indeed, all her talk of flight had been a blind, and her\\ndeparture no more than a manoeuvre.\\n\\nArcher did not really believe this.  Little as he had actually seen of\\nMadame Olenska, he was beginning to think that he could read her face,\\nand if not her face, her voice; and both had betrayed annoyance, and\\neven dismay, at Beaufort's sudden appearance.  But, after all, if this\\nwere the case, was it not worse than if she had left New York for the\\nexpress purpose of meeting him?  If she had done that, she ceased to be\\nan object of interest, she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of\\ndissemblers: a woman engaged in a love affair with Beaufort \\\"classed\\\"\\nherself irretrievably.\\n\\nNo, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably\\ndespising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an\\nadvantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and\\ntwo societies, his familiar association with artists and actors and\\npeople generally in the world's eye, and his careless contempt for\\nlocal prejudices.  Beaufort was vulgar, he was uneducated, he was\\npurse-proud; but the circumstances of his life, and a certain native\\nshrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and\\nsocially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the\\nCentral Park.  How should any one coming from a wider world not feel\\nthe difference and be attracted by it?\\n\\nMadame Olenska, in a burst of irritation, had said to Archer that he\\nand she did not talk the same language; and the young man knew that in\\nsome respects this was true.  But Beaufort understood every turn of her\\ndialect, and spoke it fluently: his view of life, his tone, his\\nattitude, were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in Count\\nOlenski's letter.  This might seem to be to his disadvantage with Count\\nOlenski's wife; but Archer was too intelligent to think that a young\\nwoman like Ellen Olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that\\nreminded her of her past.  She might believe herself wholly in revolt\\nagainst it; but what had charmed her in it would still charm her, even\\nthough it were against her will.\\n\\nThus, with a painful impartiality, did the young man make out the case\\nfor Beaufort, and for Beaufort's victim.  A longing to enlighten her\\nwas strong in him; and there were moments when he imagined that all she\\nasked was to be enlightened.\\n\\nThat evening he unpacked his books from London.  The box was full of\\nthings he had been waiting for impatiently; a new volume of Herbert\\nSpencer, another collection of the prolific Alphonse Daudet's brilliant\\ntales, and a novel called \\\"Middlemarch,\\\" as to which there had lately\\nbeen interesting things said in the reviews.  He had declined three\\ndinner invitations in favour of this feast; but though he turned the\\npages with the sensuous joy of the book-lover, he did not know what he\\nwas reading, and one book after another dropped from his hand.\\nSuddenly, among them, he lit on a small volume of verse which he had\\nordered because the name had attracted him:  \\\"The House of Life.\\\"  He\\ntook it up, and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he\\nhad ever breathed in books; so warm, so rich, and yet so ineffably\\ntender, that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary\\nof human passions.  All through the night he pursued through those\\nenchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of Ellen\\nOlenska; but when he woke the next morning, and looked out at the\\nbrownstone houses across the street, and thought of his desk in Mr.\\nLetterblair's office, and the family pew in Grace Church, his hour in\\nthe park of Skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability\\nas the visions of the night.\\n\\n\\\"Mercy, how pale you look, Newland!\\\" Janey commented over the\\ncoffee-cups at breakfast; and his mother added:  \\\"Newland, dear, I've\\nnoticed lately that you've been coughing; I do hope you're not letting\\nyourself be overworked?\\\"  For it was the conviction of both ladies\\nthat, under the iron despotism of his senior partners, the young man's\\nlife was spent in the most exhausting professional labours--and he had\\nnever thought it necessary to undeceive them.\\n\\nThe next two or three days dragged by heavily.  The taste of the usual\\nwas like cinders in his mouth, and there were moments when he felt as\\nif he were being buried alive under his future.  He heard nothing of\\nthe Countess Olenska, or of the perfect little house, and though he met\\nBeaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the\\nwhist-tables.  It was not till the fourth evening that he found a note\\nawaiting him on his return home.  \\\"Come late tomorrow: I must explain\\nto you.  Ellen.\\\"  These were the only words it contained.\\n\\nThe young man, who was dining out, thrust the note into his pocket,\\nsmiling a little at the Frenchness of the \\\"to you.\\\"  After dinner he\\nwent to a play; and it was not until his return home, after midnight,\\nthat he drew Madame Olenska's missive out again and re-read it slowly a\\nnumber of times.  There were several ways of answering it, and he gave\\nconsiderable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated\\nnight.  That on which, when morning came, he finally decided was to\\npitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was\\nleaving that very afternoon for St. Augustine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Archer walked down the sandy main street of St. Augustine to the\\nhouse which had been pointed out to him as Mr. Welland's, and saw May\\nWelland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair, he wondered\\nwhy he had waited so long to come.\\n\\nHere was the truth, here was reality, here was the life that belonged\\nto him; and he, who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary\\nrestraints, had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what\\npeople might think of his stealing a holiday!\\n\\nHer first exclamation was:  \\\"Newland--has anything happened?\\\" and it\\noccurred to him that it would have been more \\\"feminine\\\" if she had\\ninstantly read in his eyes why he had come.  But when he answered:\\n\\\"Yes--I found I had to see you,\\\" her happy blushes took the chill from\\nher surprise, and he saw how easily he would be forgiven, and how soon\\neven Mr. Letterblair's mild disapproval would be smiled away by a\\ntolerant family.\\n\\nEarly as it was, the main street was no place for any but formal\\ngreetings, and Archer longed to be alone with May, and to pour out all\\nhis tenderness and his impatience.  It still lacked an hour to the late\\nWelland breakfast-time, and instead of asking him to come in she\\nproposed that they should walk out to an old orange-garden beyond the\\ntown.  She had just been for a row on the river, and the sun that\\nnetted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its\\nmeshes.  Across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered\\nlike silver wire; and her eyes too looked lighter, almost pale in their\\nyouthful limpidity.  As she walked beside Archer with her long swinging\\ngait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete.\\n\\nTo Archer's strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of\\nthe blue sky and the lazy river.  They sat down on a bench under the\\norange-trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her.  It was like\\ndrinking at a cold spring with the sun on it; but his pressure may have\\nbeen more vehement than he had intended, for the blood rose to her face\\nand she drew back as if he had startled her.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" he asked, smiling; and she looked at him with surprise,\\nand answered:  \\\"Nothing.\\\"\\n\\nA slight embarrassment fell on them, and her hand slipped out of his.\\nIt was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for\\ntheir fugitive embrace in the Beaufort conservatory, and he saw that\\nshe was disturbed, and shaken out of her cool boyish composure.\\n\\n\\\"Tell me what you do all day,\\\" he said, crossing his arms under his\\ntilted-back head, and pushing his hat forward to screen the sun-dazzle.\\nTo let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of\\ncarrying on his own independent train of thought; and he sat listening\\nto her simple chronicle of swimming, sailing and riding, varied by an\\noccasional dance at the primitive inn when a man-of-war came in.  A few\\npleasant people from Philadelphia and Baltimore were picknicking at the\\ninn, and the Selfridge Merrys had come down for three weeks because\\nKate Merry had had bronchitis.  They were planning to lay out a lawn\\ntennis court on the sands; but no one but Kate and May had racquets,\\nand most of the people had not even heard of the game.\\n\\nAll this kept her very busy, and she had not had time to do more than\\nlook at the little vellum book that Archer had sent her the week before\\n(the \\\"Sonnets from the Portuguese\\\"); but she was learning by heart \\\"How\\nthey brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,\\\" because it was one of\\nthe first things he had ever read to her; and it amused her to be able\\nto tell him that Kate Merry had never even heard of a poet called\\nRobert Browning.\\n\\nPresently she started up, exclaiming that they would be late for\\nbreakfast; and they hurried back to the tumble-down house with its\\npointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where\\nthe Wellands were installed for the winter.  Mr. Welland's sensitive\\ndomesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel,\\nand at immense expense, and in face of almost insuperable difficulties,\\nMrs. Welland was obliged, year after year, to improvise an\\nestablishment partly made up of discontented New York servants and\\npartly drawn from the local African supply.\\n\\n\\\"The doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home;\\notherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any\\ngood,\\\" she explained, winter after winter, to the sympathising\\nPhiladelphians and Baltimoreans; and Mr. Welland, beaming across a\\nbreakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies,\\nwas presently saying to Archer: \\\"You see, my dear fellow, we camp--we\\nliterally camp.  I tell my wife and May that I want to teach them how\\nto rough it.\\\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by\\nthe young man's sudden arrival; but it had occurred to him to explain\\nthat he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold, and this seemed\\nto Mr. Welland an all-sufficient reason for abandoning any duty.\\n\\n\\\"You can't be too careful, especially toward spring,\\\" he said, heaping\\nhis plate with straw-coloured griddle-cakes and drowning them in golden\\nsyrup.  \\\"If I'd only been as prudent at your age May would have been\\ndancing at the Assemblies now, instead of spending her winters in a\\nwilderness with an old invalid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but I love it here, Papa; you know I do.  If only Newland could\\nstay I should like it a thousand times better than New York.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold,\\\" said Mrs.\\nWelland indulgently; and the young man laughed, and said he supposed\\nthere was such a thing as one's profession.\\n\\nHe managed, however, after an exchange of telegrams with the firm, to\\nmake his cold last a week; and it shed an ironic light on the situation\\nto know that Mr. Letterblair's indulgence was partly due to the\\nsatisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had\\nsettled the troublesome matter of the Olenski divorce.  Mr. Letterblair\\nhad let Mrs. Welland know that Mr. Archer had \\\"rendered an invaluable\\nservice\\\" to the whole family, and that old Mrs. Manson Mingott had been\\nparticularly pleased; and one day when May had gone for a drive with\\nher father in the only vehicle the place produced Mrs. Welland took\\noccasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter's\\npresence.\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid Ellen's ideas are not at all like ours.  She was barely\\neighteen when Medora Manson took her back to Europe--you remember the\\nexcitement when she appeared in black at her coming-out ball?  Another\\nof Medora's fads--really this time it was almost prophetic!  That must\\nhave been at least twelve years ago; and since then Ellen has never\\nbeen to America.  No wonder she is completely Europeanised.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But European society is not given to divorce: Countess Olenska thought\\nshe would be conforming to American ideas in asking for her freedom.\\\"\\nIt was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since\\nhe had left Skuytercliff, and he felt the colour rise to his cheek.\\n\\nMrs. Welland smiled compassionately.  \\\"That is just like the\\nextraordinary things that foreigners invent about us. They think we\\ndine at two o'clock and countenance divorce!  That is why it seems to\\nme so foolish to entertain them when they come to New York.  They\\naccept our hospitality, and then they go home and repeat the same\\nstupid stories.\\\"\\n\\nArcher made no comment on this, and Mrs. Welland continued:  \\\"But we do\\nmost thoroughly appreciate your persuading Ellen to give up the idea.\\nHer grandmother and her uncle Lovell could do nothing with her; both of\\nthem have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your\\ninfluence--in fact she said so to her grandmother.  She has an\\nunbounded admiration for you.  Poor Ellen--she was always a wayward\\nchild.  I wonder what her fate will be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What we've all contrived to make it,\\\" he felt like answering.  \\\"If\\nyou'd all of you rather she should be Beaufort's mistress than some\\ndecent fellow's wife you've certainly gone the right way about it.\\\"\\n\\nHe wondered what Mrs. Welland would have said if he had uttered the\\nwords instead of merely thinking them.  He could picture the sudden\\ndecomposure of her firm placid features, to which a lifelong mastery\\nover trifles had given an air of factitious authority.  Traces still\\nlingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughter's; and he asked\\nhimself if May's face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged\\nimage of invincible innocence.\\n\\nAh, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the\\ninnocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against\\nexperience!\\n\\n\\\"I verily believe,\\\" Mrs. Welland continued, \\\"that if the horrible\\nbusiness had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husband's\\ndeath-blow.  I don't know any of the details; I only ask not to, as I\\ntold poor Ellen when she tried to talk to me about it.  Having an\\ninvalid to care for, I have to keep my mind bright and happy.  But Mr.\\nWelland was terribly upset; he had a slight temperature every morning\\nwhile we were waiting to hear what had been decided.  It was the horror\\nof his girl's learning that such things were possible--but of course,\\ndear Newland, you felt that too.  We all knew that you were thinking of\\nMay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm always thinking of May,\\\" the young man rejoined, rising to cut\\nshort the conversation.\\n\\nHe had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with Mrs.\\nWelland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage.  But he could\\nthink of no arguments that would move her, and with a sense of relief\\nhe saw Mr. Welland and May driving up to the door.\\n\\nHis only hope was to plead again with May, and on the day before his\\ndeparture he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the Spanish\\nMission.  The background lent itself to allusions to European scenes;\\nand May, who was looking her loveliest under a wide-brimmed hat that\\ncast a shadow of mystery over her too-clear eyes, kindled into\\neagerness as he spoke of Granada and the Alhambra.\\n\\n\\\"We might be seeing it all this spring--even the Easter ceremonies at\\nSeville,\\\" he urged, exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger\\nconcession.\\n\\n\\\"Easter in Seville?  And it will be Lent next week!\\\" she laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Why shouldn't we be married in Lent?\\\" he rejoined; but she looked so\\nshocked that he saw his mistake.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I didn't mean that, dearest; but soon after Easter--so that\\nwe could sail at the end of April.  I know I could arrange it at the\\noffice.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled dreamily upon the possibility; but he perceived that to\\ndream of it sufficed her.  It was like hearing him read aloud out of\\nhis poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in\\nreal life.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, do go on, Newland; I do love your descriptions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why should they be only descriptions?  Why shouldn't we make them\\nreal?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We shall, dearest, of course; next year.\\\"  Her voice lingered over it.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you want them to be real sooner?  Can't I persuade you to break\\naway now?\\\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head, vanishing from him under her conniving hat-brim.\\n\\n\\\"Why should we dream away another year?  Look at me, dear!  Don't you\\nunderstand how I want you for my wife?\\\"\\n\\nFor a moment she remained motionless; then she raised on him eyes of\\nsuch despairing dearness that he half-released her waist from his hold.\\nBut suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably.  \\\"I'm not sure\\nif I DO understand,\\\" she said.  \\\"Is it--is it because you're not\\ncertain of continuing to care for me?\\\"\\n\\nArcher sprang up from his seat.  \\\"My God--perhaps--I don't know,\\\" he\\nbroke out angrily.\\n\\nMay Welland rose also; as they faced each other she seemed to grow in\\nwomanly stature and dignity.  Both were silent for a moment, as if\\ndismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words: then she said in a low\\nvoice: \\\"If that is it--is there some one else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Some one else--between you and me?\\\"  He echoed her words slowly, as\\nthough they were only half-intelligible and he wanted time to repeat\\nthe question to himself.  She seemed to catch the uncertainty of his\\nvoice, for she went on in a deepening tone:  \\\"Let us talk frankly,\\nNewland.  Sometimes I've felt a difference in you; especially since our\\nengagement has been announced.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear--what madness!\\\" he recovered himself to exclaim.\\n\\nShe met his protest with a faint smile.  \\\"If it is, it won't hurt us to\\ntalk about it.\\\"  She paused, and added, lifting her head with one of\\nher noble movements:  \\\"Or even if it's true: why shouldn't we speak of\\nit?  You might so easily have made a mistake.\\\"\\n\\nHe lowered his head, staring at the black leaf-pattern on the sunny\\npath at their feet.  \\\"Mistakes are always easy to make; but if I had\\nmade one of the kind you suggest, is it likely that I should be\\nimploring you to hasten our marriage?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked downward too, disturbing the pattern with the point of her\\nsunshade while she struggled for expression.  \\\"Yes,\\\" she said at\\nlength.  \\\"You might want--once for all--to settle the question: it's\\none way.\\\"\\n\\nHer quiet lucidity startled him, but did not mislead him into thinking\\nher insensible.  Under her hat-brim he saw the pallor of her profile,\\nand a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips.\\n\\n\\\"Well--?\\\" he questioned, sitting down on the bench, and looking up at\\nher with a frown that he tried to make playful.\\n\\nShe dropped back into her seat and went on:  \\\"You mustn't think that a\\ngirl knows as little as her parents imagine.  One hears and one\\nnotices--one has one's feelings and ideas.  And of course, long before\\nyou told me that you cared for me, I'd known that there was some one\\nelse you were interested in; every one was talking about it two years\\nago at Newport.  And once I saw you sitting together on the verandah at\\na dance--and when she came back into the house her face was sad, and I\\nfelt sorry for her; I remembered it afterward, when we were engaged.\\\"\\n\\nHer voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and she sat clasping and\\nunclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade.  The young man\\nlaid his upon them with a gentle pressure; his heart dilated with an\\ninexpressible relief.\\n\\n\\\"My dear child--was THAT it?  If you only knew the truth!\\\"\\n\\nShe raised her head quickly.  \\\"Then there is a truth I don't know?\\\"\\n\\nHe kept his hand over hers.  \\\"I meant, the truth about the old story\\nyou speak of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But that's what I want to know, Newland--what I ought to know.  I\\ncouldn't have my happiness made out of a wrong--an unfairness--to\\nsomebody else.  And I want to believe that it would be the same with\\nyou.  What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?\\\"\\n\\nHer face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like\\nbowing himself down at her feet.  \\\"I've wanted to say this for a long\\ntime,\\\" she went on.  \\\"I've wanted to tell you that, when two people\\nreally love each other, I understand that there may be situations which\\nmake it right that they should--should go against public opinion.  And\\nif you feel yourself in any way pledged ... pledged to the person we've\\nspoken of ...  and if there is any way ... any way in which you can\\nfulfill your pledge ... even by her getting a divorce ...  Newland,\\ndon't give her up because of me!\\\"\\n\\nHis surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode\\nso remote and so completely of the past as his love-affair with Mrs.\\nThorley Rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view.\\nThere was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox,\\nand if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in\\nwonder at the prodigy of the Wellands' daughter urging him to marry his\\nformer mistress.  But he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the\\nprecipice they had skirted, and full of a new awe at the mystery of\\nyoung-girlhood.\\n\\nFor a moment he could not speak; then he said: \\\"There is no pledge--no\\nobligation whatever--of the kind you think.  Such cases don't\\nalways--present themselves quite as simply as ... But that's no matter\\n... I love your generosity, because I feel as you do about those things\\n... I feel that each case must be judged individually, on its own\\nmerits ... irrespective of stupid conventionalities ... I mean, each\\nwoman's right to her liberty--\\\"  He pulled himself up, startled by the\\nturn his thoughts had taken, and went on, looking at her with a smile:\\n\\\"Since you understand so many things, dearest, can't you go a little\\nfarther, and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another\\nform of the same foolish conventionalities?  If there's no one and\\nnothing between us, isn't that an argument for marrying quickly, rather\\nthan for more delay?\\\"\\n\\nShe flushed with joy and lifted her face to his; as he bent to it he\\nsaw that her eyes were full of happy tears.  But in another moment she\\nseemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and\\ntimorous girlhood; and he understood that her courage and initiative\\nwere all for others, and that she had none for herself.  It was evident\\nthat the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied\\ncomposure betrayed, and that at his first word of reassurance she had\\ndropped back into the usual, as a too-adventurous child takes refuge in\\nits mother's arms.\\n\\nArcher had no heart to go on pleading with her; he was too much\\ndisappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one\\ndeep look at him from her transparent eyes.  May seemed to be aware of\\nhis disappointment, but without knowing how to alleviate it; and they\\nstood up and walked silently home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Your cousin the Countess called on mother while you were away,\\\" Janey\\nArcher announced to her brother on the evening of his return.\\n\\nThe young man, who was dining alone with his mother and sister, glanced\\nup in surprise and saw Mrs. Archer's gaze demurely bent on her plate.\\nMrs. Archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for\\nbeing forgotten by it; and Newland guessed that she was slightly\\nannoyed that he should be surprised by Madame Olenska's visit.\\n\\n\\\"She had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons, and a tiny green\\nmonkey muff; I never saw her so stylishly dressed,\\\" Janey continued.\\n\\\"She came alone, early on Sunday afternoon; luckily the fire was lit in\\nthe drawing-room.  She had one of those new card-cases.  She said she\\nwanted to know us because you'd been so good to her.\\\"\\n\\nNewland laughed.  \\\"Madame Olenska always takes that tone about her\\nfriends.  She's very happy at being among her own people again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, so she told us,\\\" said Mrs. Archer.  \\\"I must say she seems\\nthankful to be here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope you liked her, mother.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Archer drew her lips together.  \\\"She certainly lays herself out to\\nplease, even when she is calling on an old lady.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother doesn't think her simple,\\\" Janey interjected, her eyes screwed\\nupon her brother's face.\\n\\n\\\"It's just my old-fashioned feeling; dear May is my ideal,\\\" said Mrs.\\nArcher.\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said her son, \\\"they're not alike.\\\"\\n\\n\\nArcher had left St. Augustine charged with many messages for old Mrs.\\nMingott; and a day or two after his return to town he called on her.\\n\\nThe old lady received him with unusual warmth; she was grateful to him\\nfor persuading the Countess Olenska to give up the idea of a divorce;\\nand when he told her that he had deserted the office without leave, and\\nrushed down to St. Augustine simply because he wanted to see May, she\\ngave an adipose chuckle and patted his knee with her puff-ball hand.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, ah--so you kicked over the traces, did you?  And I suppose Augusta\\nand Welland pulled long faces, and behaved as if the end of the world\\nhad come?  But little May--she knew better, I'll be bound?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hoped she did; but after all she wouldn't agree to what I'd gone\\ndown to ask for.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wouldn't she indeed?  And what was that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in April.\\nWhat's the use of our wasting another year?\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Manson Mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic\\nprudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids.  \\\"'Ask Mamma,' I\\nsuppose--the usual story.  Ah, these Mingotts--all alike!  Born in a\\nrut, and you can't root 'em out of it.  When I built this house you'd\\nhave thought I was moving to California!  Nobody ever HAD built above\\nFortieth Street--no, says I, nor above the Battery either, before\\nChristopher Columbus discovered America.  No, no; not one of them wants\\nto be different; they're as scared of it as the small-pox.  Ah, my dear\\nMr. Archer, I thank my stars I'm nothing but a vulgar Spicer; but\\nthere's not one of my own children that takes after me but my little\\nEllen.\\\"  She broke off, still twinkling at him, and asked, with the\\ncasual irrelevance of old age:  \\\"Now, why in the world didn't you marry\\nmy little Ellen?\\\"\\n\\nArcher laughed.  \\\"For one thing, she wasn't there to be married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No--to be sure; more's the pity.  And now it's too late; her life is\\nfinished.\\\"  She spoke with the cold-blooded complacency of the aged\\nthrowing earth into the grave of young hopes.  The young man's heart\\ngrew chill, and he said hurriedly:  \\\"Can't I persuade you to use your\\ninfluence with the Wellands, Mrs. Mingott?  I wasn't made for long\\nengagements.\\\"\\n\\nOld Catherine beamed on him approvingly.  \\\"No; I can see that.  You've\\ngot a quick eye.  When you were a little boy I've no doubt you liked to\\nbe helped first.\\\" She threw back her head with a laugh that made her\\nchins ripple like little waves.  \\\"Ah, here's my Ellen now!\\\" she\\nexclaimed, as the portieres parted behind her.\\n\\nMadame Olenska came forward with a smile.  Her face looked vivid and\\nhappy, and she held out her hand gaily to Archer while she stooped to\\nher grandmother's kiss.\\n\\n\\\"I was just saying to him, my dear:  'Now, why didn't you marry my\\nlittle Ellen?'\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska looked at Archer, still smiling.  \\\"And what did he\\nanswer?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my darling, I leave you to find that out!  He's been down to\\nFlorida to see his sweetheart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know.\\\"  She still looked at him.  \\\"I went to see your mother,\\nto ask where you'd gone.  I sent a note that you never answered, and I\\nwas afraid you were ill.\\\"\\n\\nHe muttered something about leaving unexpectedly, in a great hurry, and\\nhaving intended to write to her from St. Augustine.\\n\\n\\\"And of course once you were there you never thought of me again!\\\"  She\\ncontinued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied\\nassumption of indifference.\\n\\n\\\"If she still needs me, she's determined not to let me see it,\\\" he\\nthought, stung by her manner.  He wanted to thank her for having been\\nto see his mother, but under the ancestress's malicious eye he felt\\nhimself tongue-tied and constrained.\\n\\n\\\"Look at him--in such hot haste to get married that he took French\\nleave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees!  That's\\nsomething like a lover--that's the way handsome Bob Spicer carried off\\nmy poor mother; and then got tired of her before I was weaned--though\\nthey only had to wait eight months for me!  But there--you're not a\\nSpicer, young man; luckily for you and for May.  It's only my poor\\nEllen that has kept any of their wicked blood; the rest of them are all\\nmodel Mingotts,\\\" cried the old lady scornfully.\\n\\nArcher was aware that Madame Olenska, who had seated herself at her\\ngrandmother's side, was still thoughtfully scrutinising him.  The\\ngaiety had faded from her eyes, and she said with great gentleness:\\n\\\"Surely, Granny, we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes.\\\"\\n\\nArcher rose to go, and as his hand met Madame Olenska's he felt that\\nshe was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter.\\n\\n\\\"When can I see you?\\\" he asked, as she walked with him to the door of\\nthe room.\\n\\n\\\"Whenever you like; but it must be soon if you want to see the little\\nhouse again.  I am moving next week.\\\"\\n\\nA pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the\\nlow-studded drawing-room.  Few as they had been, they were thick with\\nmemories.\\n\\n\\\"Tomorrow evening?\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded.  \\\"Tomorrow; yes; but early.  I'm going out.\\\"\\n\\nThe next day was a Sunday, and if she were \\\"going out\\\" on a Sunday\\nevening it could, of course, be only to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's.  He\\nfelt a slight movement of annoyance, not so much at her going there\\n(for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van\\nder Luydens), but because it was the kind of house at which she was\\nsure to meet Beaufort, where she must have known beforehand that she\\nwould meet him--and where she was probably going for that purpose.\\n\\n\\\"Very well; tomorrow evening,\\\" he repeated, inwardly resolved that he\\nwould not go early, and that by reaching her door late he would either\\nprevent her from going to Mrs. Struthers's, or else arrive after she\\nhad started--which, all things considered, would no doubt be the\\nsimplest solution.\\n\\n\\nIt was only half-past eight, after all, when he rang the bell under the\\nwisteria; not as late as he had intended by half an hour--but a\\nsingular restlessness had driven him to her door.  He reflected,\\nhowever, that Mrs. Struthers's Sunday evenings were not like a ball,\\nand that her guests, as if to minimise their delinquency, usually went\\nearly.\\n\\nThe one thing he had not counted on, in entering Madame Olenska's hall,\\nwas to find hats and overcoats there.  Why had she bidden him to come\\nearly if she was having people to dine?  On a closer inspection of the\\ngarments besides which Nastasia was laying his own, his resentment gave\\nway to curiosity.  The overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had\\never seen under a polite roof; and it took but a glance to assure\\nhimself that neither of them belonged to Julius Beaufort.  One was a\\nshaggy yellow ulster of \\\"reach-me-down\\\" cut, the other a very old and\\nrusty cloak with a cape--something like what the French called a\\n\\\"Macfarlane.\\\" This garment, which appeared to be made for a person of\\nprodigious size, had evidently seen long and hard wear, and its\\ngreenish-black folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of\\nprolonged sessions against bar-room walls.  On it lay a ragged grey\\nscarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape.\\n\\nArcher raised his eyebrows enquiringly at Nastasia, who raised hers in\\nreturn with a fatalistic \\\"Gia!\\\" as she threw open the drawing-room door.\\n\\nThe young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room; then,\\nwith surprise, he discovered another lady standing by the fire.  This\\nlady, who was long, lean and loosely put together, was clad in raiment\\nintricately looped and fringed, with plaids and stripes and bands of\\nplain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing.\\nHer hair, which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading,\\nwas surmounted by a Spanish comb and black lace scarf, and silk\\nmittens, visibly darned, covered her rheumatic hands.\\n\\nBeside her, in a cloud of cigar-smoke, stood the owners of the two\\novercoats, both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken\\noff since morning.  In one of the two, Archer, to his surprise,\\nrecognised Ned Winsett; the other and older, who was unknown to him,\\nand whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the\\n\\\"Macfarlane,\\\" had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair, and\\nmoved his arms with large pawing gestures, as though he were\\ndistributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude.\\n\\nThese three persons stood together on the hearth-rug, their eyes fixed\\non an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses, with a knot of\\npurple pansies at their base, that lay on the sofa where Madame Olenska\\nusually sat.\\n\\n\\\"What they must have cost at this season--though of course it's the\\nsentiment one cares about!\\\" the lady was saying in a sighing staccato\\nas Archer came in.\\n\\nThe three turned with surprise at his appearance, and the lady,\\nadvancing, held out her hand.\\n\\n\\\"Dear Mr. Archer--almost my cousin Newland!\\\" she said.  \\\"I am the\\nMarchioness Manson.\\\"\\n\\nArcher bowed, and she continued:  \\\"My Ellen has taken me in for a few\\ndays.  I came from Cuba, where I have been spending the winter with\\nSpanish friends--such delightful distinguished people: the highest\\nnobility of old Castile--how I wish you could know them!  But I was\\ncalled away by our dear great friend here, Dr. Carver.  You don't know\\nDr. Agathon Carver, founder of the Valley of Love Community?\\\"\\n\\nDr. Carver inclined his leonine head, and the Marchioness continued:\\n\\\"Ah, New York--New York--how little the life of the spirit has reached\\nit!  But I see you do know Mr. Winsett.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes--I reached him some time ago; but not by that route,\\\" Winsett\\nsaid with his dry smile.\\n\\nThe Marchioness shook her head reprovingly.  \\\"How do you know, Mr.\\nWinsett?  The spirit bloweth where it listeth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"List--oh, list!\\\" interjected Dr. Carver in a stentorian murmur.\\n\\n\\\"But do sit down, Mr. Archer.  We four have been having a delightful\\nlittle dinner together, and my child has gone up to dress.  She expects\\nyou; she will be down in a moment.  We were just admiring these\\nmarvellous flowers, which will surprise her when she reappears.\\\"\\n\\nWinsett remained on his feet.  \\\"I'm afraid I must be off.  Please tell\\nMadame Olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our\\nstreet.  This house has been an oasis.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, but she won't abandon YOU.  Poetry and art are the breath of life\\nto her.  It IS poetry you write, Mr. Winsett?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, no; but I sometimes read it,\\\" said Winsett, including the group\\nin a general nod and slipping out of the room.\\n\\n\\\"A caustic spirit--un peu sauvage.  But so witty; Dr. Carver, you DO\\nthink him witty?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never think of wit,\\\" said Dr. Carver severely.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--ah--you never think of wit!  How merciless he is to us weak\\nmortals, Mr. Archer!  But he lives only in the life of the spirit; and\\ntonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently\\nat Mrs. Blenker's.  Dr. Carver, would there be time, before you start\\nfor the Blenkers' to explain to Mr. Archer your illuminating discovery\\nof the Direct Contact?  But no; I see it is nearly nine o'clock, and we\\nhave no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion, but, having\\ncompared his ponderous gold time-piece with Madame Olenska's little\\ntravelling-clock, he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for\\ndeparture.\\n\\n\\\"I shall see you later, dear friend?\\\" he suggested to the Marchioness,\\nwho replied with a smile:  \\\"As soon as Ellen's carriage comes I will\\njoin you; I do hope the lecture won't have begun.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Carver looked thoughtfully at Archer.  \\\"Perhaps, if this young\\ngentleman is interested in my experiences, Mrs. Blenker might allow you\\nto bring him with you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dear friend, if it were possible--I am sure she would be too\\nhappy.  But I fear my Ellen counts on Mr. Archer herself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That,\\\" said Dr. Carver, \\\"is unfortunate--but here is my card.\\\"  He\\nhanded it to Archer, who read on it, in Gothic characters:\\n\\n  +---------------------------+\\n  |      Agathon Carver       |\\n  |    The Valley of Love     |\\n  |   Kittasquattamy, N. Y.   |\\n  +---------------------------+\\n\\n\\nDr. Carver bowed himself out, and Mrs. Manson, with a sigh that might\\nhave been either of regret or relief, again waved Archer to a seat.\\n\\n\\\"Ellen will be down in a moment; and before she comes, I am so glad of\\nthis quiet moment with you.\\\"\\n\\nArcher murmured his pleasure at their meeting, and the Marchioness\\ncontinued, in her low sighing accents: \\\"I know everything, dear Mr.\\nArcher--my child has told me all you have done for her.  Your wise\\nadvice: your courageous firmness--thank heaven it was not too late!\\\"\\n\\nThe young man listened with considerable embarrassment.  Was there any\\none, he wondered, to whom Madame Olenska had not proclaimed his\\nintervention in her private affairs?\\n\\n\\\"Madame Olenska exaggerates; I simply gave her a legal opinion, as she\\nasked me to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, but in doing it--in doing it you were the unconscious instrument\\nof--of--what word have we moderns for Providence, Mr. Archer?\\\" cried\\nthe lady, tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids\\nmysteriously.  \\\"Little did you know that at that very moment I was\\nbeing appealed to: being approached, in fact--from the other side of\\nthe Atlantic!\\\"\\n\\nShe glanced over her shoulder, as though fearful of being overheard,\\nand then, drawing her chair nearer, and raising a tiny ivory fan to her\\nlips, breathed behind it:  \\\"By the Count himself--my poor, mad, foolish\\nOlenski; who asks only to take her back on her own terms.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good God!\\\" Archer exclaimed, springing up.\\n\\n\\\"You are horrified?  Yes, of course; I understand.  I don't defend poor\\nStanislas, though he has always called me his best friend.  He does not\\ndefend himself--he casts himself at her feet: in my person.\\\"  She\\ntapped her emaciated bosom.  \\\"I have his letter here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A letter?--Has Madame Olenska seen it?\\\" Archer stammered, his brain\\nwhirling with the shock of the announcement.\\n\\nThe Marchioness Manson shook her head softly.  \\\"Time--time; I must have\\ntime.  I know my Ellen--haughty, intractable; shall I say, just a shade\\nunforgiving?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, good heavens, to forgive is one thing; to go back into that\\nhell--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, yes,\\\" the Marchioness acquiesced.  \\\"So she describes it--my\\nsensitive child!  But on the material side, Mr. Archer, if one may\\nstoop to consider such things; do you know what she is giving up?\\nThose roses there on the sofa--acres like them, under glass and in the\\nopen, in his matchless terraced gardens at Nice!  Jewels--historic\\npearls: the Sobieski emeralds--sables,--but she cares nothing for all\\nthese!  Art and beauty, those she does care for, she lives for, as I\\nalways have; and those also surrounded her.  Pictures, priceless\\nfurniture, music, brilliant conversation--ah, that, my dear young man,\\nif you'll excuse me, is what you've no conception of here!  And she had\\nit all; and the homage of the greatest.  She tells me she is not\\nthought handsome in New York--good heavens!  Her portrait has been\\npainted nine times; the greatest artists in Europe have begged for the\\nprivilege.  Are these things nothing?  And the remorse of an adoring\\nhusband?\\\"\\n\\nAs the Marchioness Manson rose to her climax her face assumed an\\nexpression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved Archer's\\nmirth had he not been numb with amazement.\\n\\nHe would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first\\nsight of poor Medora Manson would have been in the guise of a messenger\\nof Satan; but he was in no mood for laughing now, and she seemed to him\\nto come straight out of the hell from which Ellen Olenska had just\\nescaped.\\n\\n\\\"She knows nothing yet--of all this?\\\" he asked abruptly.\\n\\nMrs. Manson laid a purple finger on her lips.  \\\"Nothing directly--but\\ndoes she suspect?  Who can tell?  The truth is, Mr. Archer, I have been\\nwaiting to see you.  From the moment I heard of the firm stand you had\\ntaken, and of your influence over her, I hoped it might be possible to\\ncount on your support--to convince you ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That she ought to go back?  I would rather see her dead!\\\" cried the\\nyoung man violently.\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" the Marchioness murmured, without visible resentment.  For a\\nwhile she sat in her arm-chair, opening and shutting the absurd ivory\\nfan between her mittened fingers; but suddenly she lifted her head and\\nlistened.\\n\\n\\\"Here she comes,\\\" she said in a rapid whisper; and then, pointing to\\nthe bouquet on the sofa:  \\\"Am I to understand that you prefer THAT, Mr.\\nArcher?  After all, marriage is marriage ... and my niece is still a\\nwife...\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"What are you two plotting together, aunt Medora?\\\" Madame Olenska cried\\nas she came into the room.\\n\\nShe was dressed as if for a ball.  Everything about her shimmered and\\nglimmered softly, as if her dress had been woven out of candle-beams;\\nand she carried her head high, like a pretty woman challenging a\\nroomful of rivals.\\n\\n\\\"We were saying, my dear, that here was something beautiful to surprise\\nyou with,\\\" Mrs. Manson rejoined, rising to her feet and pointing archly\\nto the flowers.\\n\\nMadame Olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet.  Her colour did\\nnot change, but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like\\nsummer lightning.  \\\"Ah,\\\" she exclaimed, in a shrill voice that the\\nyoung man had never heard, \\\"who is ridiculous enough to send me a\\nbouquet?  Why a bouquet?  And why tonight of all nights?  I am not\\ngoing to a ball; I am not a girl engaged to be married.  But some\\npeople are always ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\nShe turned back to the door, opened it, and called out:  \\\"Nastasia!\\\"\\n\\nThe ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared, and Archer heard Madame\\nOlenska say, in an Italian that she seemed to pronounce with\\nintentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it:\\n\\\"Here--throw this into the dustbin!\\\" and then, as Nastasia stared\\nprotestingly:  \\\"But no--it's not the fault of the poor flowers.  Tell\\nthe boy to carry them to the house three doors away, the house of Mr.\\nWinsett, the dark gentleman who dined here.  His wife is ill--they may\\ngive her pleasure ... The boy is out, you say?  Then, my dear one, run\\nyourself; here, put my cloak over you and fly.  I want the thing out of\\nthe house immediately!  And, as you live, don't say they come from me!\\\"\\n\\nShe flung her velvet opera cloak over the maid's shoulders and turned\\nback into the drawing-room, shutting the door sharply.  Her bosom was\\nrising high under its lace, and for a moment Archer thought she was\\nabout to cry; but she burst into a laugh instead, and looking from the\\nMarchioness to Archer, asked abruptly: \\\"And you two--have you made\\nfriends!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's for Mr. Archer to say, darling; he has waited patiently while you\\nwere dressing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--I gave you time enough: my hair wouldn't go,\\\" Madame Olenska\\nsaid, raising her hand to the heaped-up curls of her chignon.  \\\"But\\nthat reminds me: I see Dr. Carver is gone, and you'll be late at the\\nBlenkers'.  Mr. Archer, will you put my aunt in the carriage?\\\"\\n\\nShe followed the Marchioness into the hall, saw her fitted into a\\nmiscellaneous heap of overshoes, shawls and tippets, and called from\\nthe doorstep:  \\\"Mind, the carriage is to be back for me at ten!\\\"  Then\\nshe returned to the drawing-room, where Archer, on re-entering it,\\nfound her standing by the mantelpiece, examining herself in the mirror.\\nIt was not usual, in New York society, for a lady to address her\\nparlour-maid as \\\"my dear one,\\\" and send her out on an errand wrapped in\\nher own opera-cloak; and Archer, through all his deeper feelings,\\ntasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action\\nfollowed on emotion with such Olympian speed.\\n\\nMadame Olenska did not move when he came up behind her, and for a\\nsecond their eyes met in the mirror; then she turned, threw herself\\ninto her sofa-corner, and sighed out:  \\\"There's time for a cigarette.\\\"\\n\\nHe handed her the box and lit a spill for her; and as the flame flashed\\nup into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said:  \\\"What\\ndo you think of me in a temper?\\\"\\n\\nArcher paused a moment; then he answered with sudden resolution:  \\\"It\\nmakes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I knew she'd been talking about me.  Well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She said you were used to all kinds of things--splendours and\\namusements and excitements--that we could never hope to give you here.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips.\\n\\n\\\"Medora is incorrigibly romantic.  It has made up to her for so many\\nthings!\\\"\\n\\nArcher hesitated again, and again took his risk.  \\\"Is your aunt's\\nromanticism always consistent with accuracy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean: does she speak the truth?\\\"  Her niece considered.  \\\"Well,\\nI'll tell you: in almost everything she says, there's something true\\nand something untrue.  But why do you ask?  What has she been telling\\nyou?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked away into the fire, and then back at her shining presence.\\nHis heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening\\nby that fireside, and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry\\nher away.\\n\\n\\\"She says--she pretends that Count Olenski has asked her to persuade\\nyou to go back to him.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska made no answer.  She sat motionless, holding her\\ncigarette in her half-lifted hand.  The expression of her face had not\\nchanged; and Archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent\\nincapacity for surprise.\\n\\n\\\"You knew, then?\\\" he broke out.\\n\\nShe was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette.\\nShe brushed it to the floor.  \\\"She has hinted about a letter: poor\\ndarling!  Medora's hints--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it at your husband's request that she has arrived here suddenly?\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska seemed to consider this question also.  \\\"There again:\\none can't tell.  She told me she had had a 'spiritual summons,'\\nwhatever that is, from Dr. Carver.  I'm afraid she's going to marry Dr.\\nCarver ...  poor Medora, there's always some one she wants to marry.\\nBut perhaps the people in Cuba just got tired of her!  I think she was\\nwith them as a sort of paid companion.  Really, I don't know why she\\ncame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you do believe she has a letter from your husband?\\\"\\n\\nAgain Madame Olenska brooded silently; then she said:  \\\"After all, it\\nwas to be expected.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace.  A sudden\\nrestlessness possessed him, and he was tongue-tied by the sense that\\ntheir minutes were numbered, and that at any moment he might hear the\\nwheels of the returning carriage.\\n\\n\\\"You know that your aunt believes you will go back?\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska raised her head quickly.  A deep blush rose to her face\\nand spread over her neck and shoulders.  She blushed seldom and\\npainfully, as if it hurt her like a burn.\\n\\n\\\"Many cruel things have been believed of me,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Ellen--forgive me; I'm a fool and a brute!\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled a little.  \\\"You are horribly nervous; you have your own\\ntroubles.  I know you think the Wellands are unreasonable about your\\nmarriage, and of course I agree with you.  In Europe people don't\\nunderstand our long American engagements; I suppose they are not as\\ncalm as we are.\\\"  She pronounced the \\\"we\\\" with a faint emphasis that\\ngave it an ironic sound.\\n\\nArcher felt the irony but did not dare to take it up.  After all, she\\nhad perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs,\\nand after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that\\nall he could do was to follow her lead.  But the sense of the waning\\nhour made him desperate: he could not bear the thought that a barrier\\nof words should drop between them again.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he said abruptly; \\\"I went south to ask May to marry me after\\nEaster.  There's no reason why we shouldn't be married then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And May adores you--and yet you couldn't convince her?  I thought her\\ntoo intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She IS too intelligent--she's not their slave.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska looked at him.  \\\"Well, then--I don't understand.\\\"\\n\\nArcher reddened, and hurried on with a rush.  \\\"We had a frank\\ntalk--almost the first.  She thinks my impatience a bad sign.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Merciful heavens--a bad sign?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She thinks it means that I can't trust myself to go on caring for her.\\nShe thinks, in short, I want to marry her at once to get away from some\\none that I--care for more.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska examined this curiously.  \\\"But if she thinks that--why\\nisn't she in a hurry too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because she's not like that: she's so much nobler.  She insists all\\nthe more on the long engagement, to give me time--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Time to give her up for the other woman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I want to.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed\\neyes.  Down the quiet street Archer heard the approaching trot of her\\nhorses.\\n\\n\\\"That IS noble,\\\" she said, with a slight break in her voice.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.  But it's ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ridiculous?  Because you don't care for any one else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because I don't mean to marry any one else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah.\\\"  There was another long interval.  At length she looked up at him\\nand asked:  \\\"This other woman--does she love you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, there's no other woman; I mean, the person that May was thinking\\nof is--was never--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, why, after all, are you in such haste?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's your carriage,\\\" said Archer.\\n\\nShe half-rose and looked about her with absent eyes.  Her fan and\\ngloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; I suppose I must be going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're going to Mrs. Struthers's?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"  She smiled and added:  \\\"I must go where I am invited, or I\\nshould be too lonely.  Why not come with me?\\\"\\n\\nArcher felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him, must make her\\ngive him the rest of her evening.  Ignoring her question, he continued\\nto lean against the chimney-piece, his eyes fixed on the hand in which\\nshe held her gloves and fan, as if watching to see if he had the power\\nto make her drop them.\\n\\n\\\"May guessed the truth,\\\" he said.  \\\"There is another woman--but not the\\none she thinks.\\\"\\n\\nEllen Olenska made no answer, and did not move.  After a moment he sat\\ndown beside her, and, taking her hand, softly unclasped it, so that the\\ngloves and fan fell on the sofa between them.\\n\\nShe started up, and freeing herself from him moved away to the other\\nside of the hearth.  \\\"Ah, don't make love to me!  Too many people have\\ndone that,\\\" she said, frowning.\\n\\nArcher, changing colour, stood up also: it was the bitterest rebuke she\\ncould have given him.  \\\"I have never made love to you,\\\" he said, \\\"and I\\nnever shall.  But you are the woman I would have married if it had been\\npossible for either of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Possible for either of us?\\\"  She looked at him with unfeigned\\nastonishment.  \\\"And you say that--when it's you who've made it\\nimpossible?\\\"\\n\\nHe stared at her, groping in a blackness through which a single arrow\\nof light tore its blinding way.\\n\\n\\\"I'VE made it impossible--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You, you, YOU!\\\" she cried, her lip trembling like a child's on the\\nverge of tears.  \\\"Isn't it you who made me give up divorcing--give it\\nup because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was, how one must\\nsacrifice one's self to preserve the dignity of marriage ... and to\\nspare one's family the publicity, the scandal?  And because my family\\nwas going to be your family--for May's sake and for yours--I did what\\nyou told me, what you proved to me that I ought to do.  Ah,\\\" she broke\\nout with a sudden laugh, \\\"I've made no secret of having done it for\\nyou!\\\"\\n\\nShe sank down on the sofa again, crouching among the festive ripples of\\nher dress like a stricken masquerader; and the young man stood by the\\nfireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving.\\n\\n\\\"Good God,\\\" he groaned.  \\\"When I thought--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You thought?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, don't ask me what I thought!\\\"\\n\\nStill looking at her, he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck\\nto her face.  She sat upright, facing him with a rigid dignity.\\n\\n\\\"I do ask you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then: there were things in that letter you asked me to read--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My husband's letter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had nothing to fear from that letter: absolutely nothing!  All I\\nfeared was to bring notoriety, scandal, on the family--on you and May.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good God,\\\" he groaned again, bowing his face in his hands.\\n\\nThe silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final\\nand irrevocable.  It seemed to Archer to be crushing him down like his\\nown grave-stone; in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever\\nlift that load from his heart.  He did not move from his place, or\\nraise his head from his hands; his hidden eyeballs went on staring into\\nutter darkness.\\n\\n\\\"At least I loved you--\\\" he brought out.\\n\\nOn the other side of the hearth, from the sofa-corner where he supposed\\nthat she still crouched, he heard a faint stifled crying like a\\nchild's.  He started up and came to her side.\\n\\n\\\"Ellen!  What madness!  Why are you crying?  Nothing's done that can't\\nbe undone.  I'm still free, and you're going to be.\\\"  He had her in his\\narms, her face like a wet flower at his lips, and all their vain\\nterrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise.  The one thing that\\nastonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes\\narguing with her across the width of the room, when just touching her\\nmade everything so simple.\\n\\nShe gave him back all his kiss, but after a moment he felt her\\nstiffening in his arms, and she put him aside and stood up.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my poor Newland--I suppose this had to be.  But it doesn't in the\\nleast alter things,\\\" she said, looking down at him in her turn from the\\nhearth.\\n\\n\\\"It alters the whole of life for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no--it mustn't, it can't.  You're engaged to May Welland; and I'm\\nmarried.\\\"\\n\\nHe stood up too, flushed and resolute.  \\\"Nonsense!  It's too late for\\nthat sort of thing.  We've no right to lie to other people or to\\nourselves.  We won't talk of your marriage; but do you see me marrying\\nMay after this?\\\"\\n\\nShe stood silent, resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece, her\\nprofile reflected in the glass behind her.  One of the locks of her\\nchignon had become loosened and hung on her neck; she looked haggard\\nand almost old.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see you,\\\" she said at length, \\\"putting that question to May.\\nDo you?\\\"\\n\\nHe gave a reckless shrug.  \\\"It's too late to do anything else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You say that because it's the easiest thing to say at this moment--not\\nbecause it's true.  In reality it's too late to do anything but what\\nwe'd both decided on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I don't understand you!\\\"\\n\\nShe forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing\\nit.  \\\"You don't understand because you haven't yet guessed how you've\\nchanged things for me: oh, from the first--long before I knew all you'd\\ndone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All I'd done?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.  I was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy\\nof me--that they thought I was a dreadful sort of person.  It seems\\nthey had even refused to meet me at dinner.  I found that out\\nafterward; and how you'd made your mother go with you to the van der\\nLuydens'; and how you'd insisted on announcing your engagement at the\\nBeaufort ball, so that I might have two families to stand by me instead\\nof one--\\\"\\n\\nAt that he broke into a laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Just imagine,\\\" she said, \\\"how stupid and unobservant I was!  I knew\\nnothing of all this till Granny blurted it out one day.  New York\\nsimply meant peace and freedom to me: it was coming home.  And I was so\\nhappy at being among my own people that every one I met seemed kind and\\ngood, and glad to see me.  But from the very beginning,\\\" she continued,\\n\\\"I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons\\nthat I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard\\nand--unnecessary.  The very good people didn't convince me; I felt\\nthey'd never been tempted.  But you knew; you understood; you had felt\\nthe world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands--and yet you\\nhated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by\\ndisloyalty and cruelty and indifference.  That was what I'd never known\\nbefore--and it's better than anything I've known.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke in a low even voice, without tears or visible agitation; and\\neach word, as it dropped from her, fell into his breast like burning\\nlead.  He sat bowed over, his head between his hands, staring at the\\nhearthrug, and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her\\ndress.  Suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe.\\n\\nShe bent over him, laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking at\\nhim with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, don't let us undo what you've done!\\\" she cried.  \\\"I can't go back\\nnow to that other way of thinking.  I can't love you unless I give you\\nup.\\\"\\n\\nHis arms were yearning up to her; but she drew away, and they remained\\nfacing each other, divided by the distance that her words had created.\\nThen, abruptly, his anger overflowed.\\n\\n\\\"And Beaufort?  Is he to replace me?\\\"\\n\\nAs the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of\\nanger; and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own.  But Madame\\nOlenska only grew a shade paler, and stood with her arms hanging down\\nbefore her, and her head slightly bent, as her way was when she\\npondered a question.\\n\\n\\\"He's waiting for you now at Mrs. Struthers's; why don't you go to\\nhim?\\\" Archer sneered.\\n\\nShe turned to ring the bell.  \\\"I shall not go out this evening; tell\\nthe carriage to go and fetch the Signora Marchesa,\\\" she said when the\\nmaid came.\\n\\nAfter the door had closed again Archer continued to look at her with\\nbitter eyes.  \\\"Why this sacrifice?  Since you tell me that you're\\nlonely I've no right to keep you from your friends.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled a little under her wet lashes.  \\\"I shan't be lonely now.  I\\nWAS lonely; I WAS afraid.  But the emptiness and the darkness are gone;\\nwhen I turn back into myself now I'm like a child going at night into a\\nroom where there's always a light.\\\"\\n\\nHer tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility,\\nand Archer groaned out again:  \\\"I don't understand you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yet you understand May!\\\"\\n\\nHe reddened under the retort, but kept his eyes on her.  \\\"May is ready\\nto give me up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What!  Three days after you've entreated her on your knees to hasten\\nyour marriage?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's refused; that gives me the right--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you've taught me what an ugly word that is,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe turned away with a sense of utter weariness.  He felt as though he\\nhad been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice, and\\nnow, just as he had fought his way to the top, his hold had given way\\nand he was pitching down headlong into darkness.\\n\\nIf he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her\\narguments; but she still held him at a distance by something\\ninscrutably aloof in her look and attitude, and by his own awed sense\\nof her sincerity.  At length he began to plead again.\\n\\n\\\"If we do this now it will be worse afterward--worse for every one--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No--no--no!\\\" she almost screamed, as if he frightened her.\\n\\nAt that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house.  They had\\nheard no carriage stopping at the door, and they stood motionless,\\nlooking at each other with startled eyes.\\n\\nOutside, Nastasia's step crossed the hall, the outer door opened, and a\\nmoment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the\\nCountess Olenska.\\n\\n\\\"The lady was very happy at the flowers,\\\" Nastasia said, smoothing her\\napron.  \\\"She thought it was her signor marito who had sent them, and\\nshe cried a little and said it was a folly.\\\"\\n\\nHer mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope.  She tore it open and\\ncarried it to the lamp; then, when the door had closed again, she\\nhanded the telegram to Archer.\\n\\nIt was dated from St. Augustine, and addressed to the Countess Olenska.\\nIn it he read:  \\\"Granny's telegram successful.  Papa and Mamma agree\\nmarriage after Easter.  Am telegraphing Newland.  Am too happy for\\nwords and love you dearly.  Your grateful May.\\\"\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later, when Archer unlocked his own front-door, he found a\\nsimilar envelope on the hall-table on top of his pile of notes and\\nletters.  The message inside the envelope was also from May Welland,\\nand ran as follows:  \\\"Parents consent wedding Tuesday after Easter at\\ntwelve Grace Church eight bridesmaids please see Rector so happy love\\nMay.\\\"\\n\\nArcher crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate\\nthe news it contained.  Then he pulled out a small pocket-diary and\\nturned over the pages with trembling fingers; but he did not find what\\nhe wanted, and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the\\nstairs.\\n\\nA light was shining through the door of the little hall-room which\\nserved Janey as a dressing-room and boudoir, and her brother rapped\\nimpatiently on the panel.  The door opened, and his sister stood before\\nhim in her immemorial purple flannel dressing-gown, with her hair \\\"on\\npins.\\\"  Her face looked pale and apprehensive.\\n\\n\\\"Newland!  I hope there's no bad news in that telegram?  I waited on\\npurpose, in case--\\\"  (No item of his correspondence was safe from\\nJaney.)\\n\\nHe took no notice of her question.  \\\"Look here--what day is Easter this\\nyear?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance.  \\\"Easter?  Newland!\\nWhy, of course, the first week in April.  Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The first week?\\\"  He turned again to the pages of his diary,\\ncalculating rapidly under his breath.  \\\"The first week, did you say?\\\"\\nHe threw back his head with a long laugh.\\n\\n\\\"For mercy's sake what's the matter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing's the matter, except that I'm going to be married in a month.\\\"\\n\\nJaney fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast.\\n\\\"Oh Newland, how wonderful!  I'm so glad!  But, dearest, why do you\\nkeep on laughing?  Do hush, or you'll wake Mamma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBook II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full of dust.  All the old\\nladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing\\nermines, and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered\\nthe faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar.\\n\\nNewland Archer, at a signal from the sexton, had come out of the vestry\\nand placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of Grace\\nChurch.\\n\\nThe signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was\\nin sight; but there was sure to be a considerable interval of\\nadjustment and consultation in the lobby, where the bridesmaids were\\nalready hovering like a cluster of Easter blossoms.  During this\\nunavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom, in proof of his eagerness,\\nwas expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled\\ncompany; and Archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as\\nthrough all the others which made of a nineteenth century New York\\nwedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history.\\nEverything was equally easy--or equally painful, as one chose to put\\nit--in the path he was committed to tread, and he had obeyed the\\nflurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms\\nhad obeyed his own, in the days when he had guided them through the\\nsame labyrinth.\\n\\nSo far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations.\\nThe bridesmaids' eight bouquets of white lilac and lilies-of-the-valley\\nhad been sent in due time, as well as the gold and sapphire\\nsleeve-links of the eight ushers and the best man's cat's-eye\\nscarf-pin; Archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording\\nof his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and\\nex-lady-loves; the fees for the Bishop and the Rector were safely in\\nthe pocket of his best man; his own luggage was already at Mrs. Manson\\nMingott's, where the wedding-breakfast was to take place, and so were\\nthe travelling clothes into which he was to change; and a private\\ncompartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young\\ncouple to their unknown destination--concealment of the spot in which\\nthe bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of\\nthe prehistoric ritual.\\n\\n\\\"Got the ring all right?\\\" whispered young van der Luyden Newland, who\\nwas inexperienced in the duties of a best man, and awed by the weight\\nof his responsibility.\\n\\nArcher made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make:\\nwith his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey\\nwaistcoat, and assured himself that the little gold circlet (engraved\\ninside: Newland to May, April ---, 187-) was in its place; then,\\nresuming his former attitude, his tall hat and pearl-grey gloves with\\nblack stitchings grasped in his left hand, he stood looking at the door\\nof the church.\\n\\nOverhead, Handel's March swelled pompously through the imitation stone\\nvaulting, carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at\\nwhich, with cheerful indifference, he had stood on the same chancel\\nstep watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms.\\n\\n\\\"How like a first night at the Opera!\\\" he thought, recognising all the\\nsame faces in the same boxes (no, pews), and wondering if, when the\\nLast Trump sounded, Mrs. Selfridge Merry would be there with the same\\ntowering ostrich feathers in her bonnet, and Mrs. Beaufort with the\\nsame diamond earrings and the same smile--and whether suitable\\nproscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world.\\n\\nAfter that there was still time to review, one by one, the familiar\\ncountenances in the first rows; the women's sharp with curiosity and\\nexcitement, the men's sulky with the obligation of having to put on\\ntheir frock-coats before luncheon, and fight for food at the\\nwedding-breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"Too bad the breakfast is at old Catherine's,\\\" the bridegroom could\\nfancy Reggie Chivers saying.  \\\"But I'm told that Lovell Mingott\\ninsisted on its being cooked by his own chef, so it ought to be good if\\none can only get at it.\\\"  And he could imagine Sillerton Jackson adding\\nwith authority:  \\\"My dear fellow, haven't you heard?  It's to be served\\nat small tables, in the new English fashion.\\\"\\n\\nArcher's eyes lingered a moment on the left-hand pew, where his mother,\\nwho had entered the church on Mr. Henry van der Luyden's arm, sat\\nweeping softly under her Chantilly veil, her hands in her grandmother's\\nermine muff.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Janey!\\\" he thought, looking at his sister, \\\"even by screwing her\\nhead around she can see only the people in the few front pews; and\\nthey're mostly dowdy Newlands and Dagonets.\\\"\\n\\nOn the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved\\nfor the families he saw Beaufort, tall and redfaced, scrutinising the\\nwomen with his arrogant stare.  Beside him sat his wife, all silvery\\nchinchilla and violets; and on the far side of the ribbon, Lawrence\\nLefferts's sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the\\ninvisible deity of \\\"Good Form\\\" who presided at the ceremony.\\n\\nArcher wondered how many flaws Lefferts's keen eyes would discover in\\nthe ritual of his divinity; then he suddenly recalled that he too had\\nonce thought such questions important.  The things that had filled his\\ndays seemed now like a nursery parody of life, or like the wrangles of\\nmediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever\\nunderstood.  A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents\\nshould be \\\"shown\\\" had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and\\nit seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work\\nthemselves into a state of agitation over such trifles, and that the\\nmatter should have been decided (in the negative) by Mrs. Welland's\\nsaying, with indignant tears:  \\\"I should as soon turn the reporters\\nloose in my house.\\\"  Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite\\nand rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when\\neverything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had\\nseemed to him fraught with world-wide significance.\\n\\n\\\"And all the while, I suppose,\\\" he thought, \\\"real people were living\\nsomewhere, and real things happening to them ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"THERE THEY COME!\\\" breathed the best man excitedly; but the bridegroom\\nknew better.\\n\\nThe cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that Mr.\\nBrown the livery-stable keeper (gowned in black in his intermittent\\ncharacter of sexton) was taking a preliminary survey of the scene\\nbefore marshalling his forces.  The door was softly shut again; then\\nafter another interval it swung majestically open, and a murmur ran\\nthrough the church:  \\\"The family!\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Welland came first, on the arm of her eldest son.  Her large pink\\nface was appropriately solemn, and her plum-coloured satin with pale\\nblue side-panels, and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met\\nwith general approval; but before she had settled herself with a\\nstately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer's the spectators were\\ncraning their necks to see who was coming after her.  Wild rumours had\\nbeen abroad the day before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott, in\\nspite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on being present at\\nthe ceremony; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting\\ncharacter that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk\\nup the nave and squeeze into a seat.  It was known that she had\\ninsisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of\\ntaking down the end panel of the front pew, and to measure the space\\nbetween the seat and the front; but the result had been discouraging,\\nand for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the\\nplan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous Bath chair and\\nsitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel.\\n\\nThe idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her\\nrelations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person\\nwho suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the\\niron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the\\ncurbstone.  The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the\\nbride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood\\noutside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even\\nold Catherine's courage, though for a moment she had weighed the\\npossibility.  \\\"Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT\\nIN THE PAPERS!\\\" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother's last plan was\\nhinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled\\nwith a collective shudder.  The ancestress had had to give in; but her\\nconcession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast\\nshould take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square\\nconnection said) with the Wellands' house in easy reach it was hard to\\nhave to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end\\nof nowhere.\\n\\nThough all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons\\na sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would\\nappear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature\\nwhen she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law.  Mrs.\\nLovell Mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies\\nof her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress; but\\nonce the disappointment occasioned by her mother-in-law's\\nnon-appearance had subsided, it was agreed that her black Chantilly\\nover lilac satin, with a bonnet of Parma violets, formed the happiest\\ncontrast to Mrs. Welland's blue and plum-colour.  Far different was the\\nimpression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on Mr.\\nMingott's arm, in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and\\nfloating scarves; and as this last apparition glided into view Archer's\\nheart contracted and stopped beating.\\n\\nHe had taken it for granted that the Marchioness Manson was still in\\nWashington, where she had gone some four weeks previously with her\\nniece, Madame Olenska.  It was generally understood that their abrupt\\ndeparture was due to Madame Olenska's desire to remove her aunt from\\nthe baleful eloquence of Dr. Agathon Carver, who had nearly succeeded\\nin enlisting her as a recruit for the Valley of Love; and in the\\ncircumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for\\nthe wedding.  For a moment Archer stood with his eyes fixed on Medora's\\nfantastic figure, straining to see who came behind her; but the little\\nprocession was at an end, for all the lesser members of the family had\\ntaken their seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselves\\ntogether like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre,\\nwere already slipping through the side doors into the lobby.\\n\\n\\\"Newland--I say: SHE'S HERE!\\\" the best man whispered.\\n\\nArcher roused himself with a start.\\n\\nA long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating,\\nfor the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave, the\\nBishop, the Rector and two white-winged assistants were hovering about\\nthe flower-banked altar, and the first chords of the Spohr symphony\\nwere strewing their flower-like notes before the bride.\\n\\nArcher opened his eyes (but could they really have been shut, as he\\nimagined?), and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task.  The\\nmusic, the scent of the lilies on the altar, the vision of the cloud of\\ntulle and orange-blossoms floating nearer and nearer, the sight of Mrs.\\nArcher's face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs, the low benedictory\\nmurmur of the Rector's voice, the ordered evolutions of the eight pink\\nbridesmaids and the eight black ushers: all these sights, sounds and\\nsensations, so familiar in themselves, so unutterably strange and\\nmeaningless in his new relation to them, were confusedly mingled in his\\nbrain.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" he thought, \\\"HAVE I got the ring?\\\"--and once more he went\\nthrough the bridegroom's convulsive gesture.\\n\\nThen, in a moment, May was beside him, such radiance streaming from her\\nthat it sent a faint warmth through his numbness, and he straightened\\nhimself and smiled into her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here,\\\" the Rector began ...\\n\\nThe ring was on her hand, the Bishop's benediction had been given, the\\nbridesmaids were a-poise to resume their place in the procession, and\\nthe organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the\\nMendelssohn March, without which no newly-wedded couple had ever\\nemerged upon New York.\\n\\n\\\"Your arm--I SAY, GIVE HER YOUR ARM!\\\" young Newland nervously hissed;\\nand once more Archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the\\nunknown.  What was it that had sent him there, he wondered?  Perhaps\\nthe glimpse, among the anonymous spectators in the transept, of a dark\\ncoil of hair under a hat which, a moment later, revealed itself as\\nbelonging to an unknown lady with a long nose, so laughably unlike the\\nperson whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were\\nbecoming subject to hallucinations.\\n\\nAnd now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave, carried\\nforward on the light Mendelssohn ripples, the spring day beckoning to\\nthem through widely opened doors, and Mrs. Welland's chestnuts, with\\nbig white favours on their frontlets, curvetting and showing off at the\\nfar end of the canvas tunnel.\\n\\nThe footman, who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel, wrapped\\nMay's white cloak about her, and Archer jumped into the brougham at her\\nside.  She turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands\\nclasped under her veil.\\n\\n\\\"Darling!\\\" Archer said--and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before\\nhim and he felt himself sinking into it, deeper and deeper, while his\\nvoice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully:  \\\"Yes, of course I thought\\nI'd lost the ring; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a\\nbridegroom didn't go through that.  But you DID keep me waiting, you\\nknow!  I had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen.\\\"\\n\\nShe surprised him by turning, in full Fifth Avenue, and flinging her\\narms about his neck.  \\\"But none ever CAN happen now, can it, Newland,\\nas long as we two are together?\\\"\\n\\n\\nEvery detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the\\nyoung couple, after the wedding-breakfast, had ample time to put on\\ntheir travelling-clothes, descend the wide Mingott stairs between\\nlaughing bridesmaids and weeping parents, and get into the brougham\\nunder the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers; and there was\\nstill half an hour left in which to drive to the station, buy the last\\nweeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers, and\\nsettle themselves in the reserved compartment in which May's maid had\\nalready placed her dove-coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new\\ndressing-bag from London.\\n\\nThe old du Lac aunts at Rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal\\nof the bridal couple, with a readiness inspired by the prospect of\\nspending a week in New York with Mrs. Archer; and Archer, glad to\\nescape the usual \\\"bridal suite\\\" in a Philadelphia or Baltimore hotel,\\nhad accepted with an equal alacrity.\\n\\nMay was enchanted at the idea of going to the country, and childishly\\namused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where\\ntheir mysterious retreat was situated.  It was thought \\\"very English\\\"\\nto have a country-house lent to one, and the fact gave a last touch of\\ndistinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant\\nwedding of the year; but where the house was no one was permitted to\\nknow, except the parents of bride and groom, who, when taxed with the\\nknowledge, pursed their lips and said mysteriously:  \\\"Ah, they didn't\\ntell us--\\\" which was manifestly true, since there was no need to.\\n\\nOnce they were settled in their compartment, and the train, shaking off\\nthe endless wooden suburbs, had pushed out into the pale landscape of\\nspring, talk became easier than Archer had expected.  May was still, in\\nlook and tone, the simple girl of yesterday, eager to compare notes\\nwith him as to the incidents of the wedding, and discussing them as\\nimpartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher.  At\\nfirst Archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an\\ninward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil\\nunawareness.  She was alone for the first time with her husband; but\\nher husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday.  There was no\\none whom she liked as much, no one whom she trusted as completely, and\\nthe culminating \\\"lark\\\" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement\\nand marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey, like a grownup\\nperson, like a \\\"married woman,\\\" in fact.\\n\\nIt was wonderful that--as he had learned in the Mission garden at St.\\nAugustine--such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of\\nimagination.  But he remembered how, even then, she had surprised him\\nby dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience\\nhad been eased of its burden; and he saw that she would probably go\\nthrough life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as\\nit came, but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance.\\n\\nPerhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their\\ntransparency, and her face the look of representing a type rather than\\na person; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a Civic Virtue\\nor a Greek goddess.  The blood that ran so close to her fair skin might\\nhave been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element; yet her\\nlook of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor\\ndull, but only primitive and pure.  In the thick of this meditation\\nArcher suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a\\nstranger, and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding-breakfast and\\nof Granny Mingott's immense and triumphant pervasion of it.\\n\\nMay settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject.  \\\"I was surprised,\\nthough--weren't you?--that aunt Medora came after all.  Ellen wrote\\nthat they were neither of them well enough to take the journey; I do\\nwish it had been she who had recovered!  Did you see the exquisite old\\nlace she sent me?\\\"\\n\\nHe had known that the moment must come sooner or later, but he had\\nsomewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay.\\n\\n\\\"Yes--I--no: yes, it was beautiful,\\\" he said, looking at her blindly,\\nand wondering if, whenever he heard those two syllables, all his\\ncarefully built-up world would tumble about him like a house of cards.\\n\\n\\\"Aren't you tired?  It will be good to have some tea when we\\narrive--I'm sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready,\\\" he\\nrattled on, taking her hand in his; and her mind rushed away instantly\\nto the magnificent tea and coffee service of Baltimore silver which the\\nBeauforts had sent, and which \\\"went\\\" so perfectly with uncle Lovell\\nMingott's trays and side-dishes.\\n\\nIn the spring twilight the train stopped at the Rhinebeck station, and\\nthey walked along the platform to the waiting carriage.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, how awfully kind of the van der Luydens--they've sent their man\\nover from Skuytercliff to meet us,\\\" Archer exclaimed, as a sedate\\nperson out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags.\\n\\n\\\"I'm extremely sorry, sir,\\\" said this emissary, \\\"that a little accident\\nhas occurred at the Miss du Lacs': a leak in the water-tank.  It\\nhappened yesterday, and Mr. van der Luyden, who heard of it this\\nmorning, sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the Patroon's\\nhouse ready.  It will be quite comfortable, I think you'll find, sir;\\nand the Miss du Lacs have sent their cook over, so that it will be\\nexactly the same as if you'd been at Rhinebeck.\\\"\\n\\nArcher stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more\\napologetic accents:  \\\"It'll be exactly the same, sir, I do assure\\nyou--\\\" and May's eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed\\nsilence:  \\\"The same as Rhinebeck?  The Patroon's house?  But it will be\\na hundred thousand times better--won't it, Newland?  It's too dear and\\nkind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it.\\\"\\n\\nAnd as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their\\nshining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly:\\n\\\"Only fancy, I've never been inside it--have you?  The van der Luydens\\nshow it to so few people.  But they opened it for Ellen, it seems, and\\nshe told me what a darling little place it was: she says it's the only\\nhouse she's seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly\\nhappy in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--that's what we're going to be, isn't it?\\\" cried her husband\\ngaily; and she answered with her boyish smile:  \\\"Ah, it's just our luck\\nbeginning--the wonderful luck we're always going to have together!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Of course we must dine with Mrs. Carfry, dearest,\\\" Archer said; and\\nhis wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental\\nBritannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table.\\n\\nIn all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people\\nwhom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously\\navoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not\\n\\\"dignified\\\" to force one's self on the notice of one's acquaintances in\\nforeign countries.\\n\\nMrs. Archer and Janey, in the course of their visits to Europe, had so\\nunflinchingly lived up to this principle, and met the friendly advances\\nof their fellow-travellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve,\\nthat they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a\\nword with a \\\"foreigner\\\" other than those employed in hotels and\\nrailway-stations.  Their own compatriots--save those previously known\\nor properly accredited--they treated with an even more pronounced\\ndisdain; so that, unless they ran across a Chivers, a Dagonet or a\\nMingott, their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete-a-tete.\\nBut the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing; and one night at\\nBotzen one of the two English ladies in the room across the passage\\n(whose names, dress and social situation were already intimately known\\nto Janey) had knocked on the door and asked if Mrs. Archer had a bottle\\nof liniment.  The other lady--the intruder's sister, Mrs. Carfry--had\\nbeen seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis; and Mrs. Archer, who\\nnever travelled without a complete family pharmacy, was fortunately\\nable to produce the required remedy.\\n\\nMrs. Carfry was very ill, and as she and her sister Miss Harle were\\ntravelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the Archer ladies,\\nwho supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid\\nhelped to nurse the invalid back to health.\\n\\nWhen the Archers left Botzen they had no idea of ever seeing Mrs.\\nCarfry and Miss Harle again.  Nothing, to Mrs. Archer's mind, would\\nhave been more \\\"undignified\\\" than to force one's self on the notice of\\na \\\"foreigner\\\" to whom one had happened to render an accidental service.\\nBut Mrs. Carfry and her sister, to whom this point of view was unknown,\\nand who would have found it utterly incomprehensible, felt themselves\\nlinked by an eternal gratitude to the \\\"delightful Americans\\\" who had\\nbeen so kind at Botzen.  With touching fidelity they seized every\\nchance of meeting Mrs. Archer and Janey in the course of their\\ncontinental travels, and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding\\nout when they were to pass through London on their way to or from the\\nStates.  The intimacy became indissoluble, and Mrs. Archer and Janey,\\nwhenever they alighted at Brown's Hotel, found themselves awaited by\\ntwo affectionate friends who, like themselves, cultivated ferns in\\nWardian cases, made macrame lace, read the memoirs of the Baroness\\nBunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading London pulpits.\\nAs Mrs. Archer said, it made \\\"another thing of London\\\" to know Mrs.\\nCarfry and Miss Harle; and by the time that Newland became engaged the\\ntie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought\\n\\\"only right\\\" to send a wedding invitation to the two English ladies,\\nwho sent, in return, a pretty bouquet of pressed Alpine flowers under\\nglass.  And on the dock, when Newland and his wife sailed for England,\\nMrs. Archer's last word had been:  \\\"You must take May to see Mrs.\\nCarfry.\\\"\\n\\nNewland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction; but\\nMrs. Carfry, with her usual acuteness, had run them down and sent them\\nan invitation to dine; and it was over this invitation that May Archer\\nwas wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins.\\n\\n\\\"It's all very well for you, Newland; you KNOW them.  But I shall feel\\nso shy among a lot of people I've never met.  And what shall I wear?\\\"\\n\\nNewland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her.  She looked\\nhandsomer and more Diana-like than ever.  The moist English air seemed\\nto have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight\\nhardness of her virginal features; or else it was simply the inner glow\\nof happiness, shining through like a light under ice.\\n\\n\\\"Wear, dearest?  I thought a trunkful of things had come from Paris\\nlast week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, of course.  I meant to say that I shan't know WHICH to wear.\\\"\\nShe pouted a little.  \\\"I've never dined out in London; and I don't want\\nto be ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\nHe tried to enter into her perplexity.  \\\"But don't Englishwomen dress\\njust like everybody else in the evening?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Newland!  How can you ask such funny questions?  When they go to the\\ntheatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, perhaps they wear new ball-dresses at home; but at any rate Mrs.\\nCarfry and Miss Harle won't.  They'll wear caps like my mother's--and\\nshawls; very soft shawls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but how will the other women be dressed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not as well as you, dear,\\\" he rejoined, wondering what had suddenly\\ndeveloped in her Janey's morbid interest in clothes.\\n\\nShe pushed back her chair with a sigh.  \\\"That's dear of you, Newland;\\nbut it doesn't help me much.\\\"\\n\\nHe had an inspiration.  \\\"Why not wear your wedding-dress?  That can't\\nbe wrong, can it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dearest!  If I only had it here!  But it's gone to Paris to be\\nmade over for next winter, and Worth hasn't sent it back.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well--\\\" said Archer, getting up.  \\\"Look here--the fog's lifting.\\nIf we made a dash for the National Gallery we might manage to catch a\\nglimpse of the pictures.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe Newland Archers were on their way home, after a three months'\\nwedding-tour which May, in writing to her girl friends, vaguely\\nsummarised as \\\"blissful.\\\"\\n\\nThey had not gone to the Italian Lakes: on reflection, Archer had not\\nbeen able to picture his wife in that particular setting.  Her own\\ninclination (after a month with the Paris dressmakers) was for\\nmountaineering in July and swimming in August.  This plan they\\npunctually fulfilled, spending July at Interlaken and Grindelwald, and\\nAugust at a little place called Etretat, on the Normandy coast, which\\nsome one had recommended as quaint and quiet.  Once or twice, in the\\nmountains, Archer had pointed southward and said: \\\"There's Italy\\\"; and\\nMay, her feet in a gentian-bed, had smiled cheerfully, and replied:\\n\\\"It would be lovely to go there next winter, if only you didn't have to\\nbe in New York.\\\"\\n\\nBut in reality travelling interested her even less than he had\\nexpected.  She regarded it (once her clothes were ordered) as merely an\\nenlarged opportunity for walking, riding, swimming, and trying her hand\\nat the fascinating new game of lawn tennis; and when they finally got\\nback to London (where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered\\nHIS clothes) she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she\\nlooked forward to sailing.\\n\\nIn London nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops; and\\nshe found the theatres less exciting than the Paris cafes chantants\\nwhere, under the blossoming horse-chestnuts of the Champs Elysees, she\\nhad had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant\\nterrace on an audience of \\\"cocottes,\\\" and having her husband interpret\\nto her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears.\\n\\nArcher had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage.  It\\nwas less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat May exactly as\\nall his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice\\nthe theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied.\\nThere was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest\\nnotion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that\\nMay's only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be\\nto lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.  Her innate dignity\\nwould always keep her from making the gift abjectly; and a day might\\neven come (as it once had) when she would find strength to take it\\naltogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good.  But\\nwith a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers\\nsuch a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly\\noutrageous in his own conduct; and the fineness of her feeling for him\\nmade that unthinkable.  Whatever happened, he knew, she would always be\\nloyal, gallant and unresentful; and that pledged him to the practice of\\nthe same virtues.\\n\\nAll this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind.  If her\\nsimplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed\\nand rebelled; but since the lines of her character, though so few, were\\non the same fine mould as her face, she became the tutelary divinity of\\nall his old traditions and reverences.\\n\\nSuch qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel,\\nthough they made her so easy and pleasant a companion; but he saw at\\nonce how they would fall into place in their proper setting.  He had no\\nfear of being oppressed by them, for his artistic and intellectual life\\nwould go on, as it always had, outside the domestic circle; and within\\nit there would be nothing small and stifling--coming back to his wife\\nwould never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open.\\nAnd when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would\\nbe filled.\\n\\nAll these things went through his mind during their long slow drive\\nfrom Mayfair to South Kensington, where Mrs. Carfry and her sister\\nlived.  Archer too would have preferred to escape their friends'\\nhospitality: in conformity with the family tradition he had always\\ntravelled as a sight-seer and looker-on, affecting a haughty\\nunconsciousness of the presence of his fellow-beings.  Once only, just\\nafter Harvard, he had spent a few gay weeks at Florence with a band of\\nqueer Europeanised Americans, dancing all night with titled ladies in\\npalaces, and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the\\nfashionable club; but it had all seemed to him, though the greatest fun\\nin the world, as unreal as a carnival.  These queer cosmopolitan women,\\ndeep in complicated love-affairs which they appeared to feel the need\\nof retailing to every one they met, and the magnificent young officers\\nand elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their\\nconfidences, were too different from the people Archer had grown up\\namong, too much like expensive and rather malodorous hot-house exotics,\\nto detain his imagination long.  To introduce his wife into such a\\nsociety was out of the question; and in the course of his travels no\\nother had shown any marked eagerness for his company.\\n\\nNot long after their arrival in London he had run across the Duke of\\nSt. Austrey, and the Duke, instantly and cordially recognising him, had\\nsaid:  \\\"Look me up, won't you?\\\"--but no proper-spirited American would\\nhave considered that a suggestion to be acted on, and the meeting was\\nwithout a sequel.  They had even managed to avoid May's English aunt,\\nthe banker's wife, who was still in Yorkshire; in fact, they had\\npurposely postponed going to London till the autumn in order that their\\narrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to\\nthese unknown relatives.\\n\\n\\\"Probably there'll be nobody at Mrs. Carfry's--London's a desert at\\nthis season, and you've made yourself much too beautiful,\\\" Archer said\\nto May, who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her\\nsky-blue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her\\nto the London grime.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want them to think that we dress like savages,\\\" she replied,\\nwith a scorn that Pocahontas might have resented; and he was struck\\nagain by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American\\nwomen for the social advantages of dress.\\n\\n\\\"It's their armour,\\\" he thought, \\\"their defence against the unknown,\\nand their defiance of it.\\\"  And he understood for the first time the\\nearnestness with which May, who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her\\nhair to charm him, had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and\\nordering her extensive wardrobe.\\n\\nHe had been right in expecting the party at Mrs. Carfry's to be a small\\none.  Besides their hostess and her sister, they found, in the long\\nchilly drawing-room, only another shawled lady, a genial Vicar who was\\nher husband, a silent lad whom Mrs. Carfry named as her nephew, and a\\nsmall dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor,\\npronouncing a French name as she did so.\\n\\nInto this dimly-lit and dim-featured group May Archer floated like a\\nswan with the sunset on her: she seemed larger, fairer, more\\nvoluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her; and he\\nperceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an\\nextreme and infantile shyness.\\n\\n\\\"What on earth will they expect me to talk about?\\\" her helpless eyes\\nimplored him, at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was\\ncalling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms.  But beauty, even\\nwhen distrustful of itself, awakens confidence in the manly heart; and\\nthe Vicar and the French-named tutor were soon manifesting to May their\\ndesire to put her at her ease.\\n\\nIn spite of their best efforts, however, the dinner was a languishing\\naffair.  Archer noticed that his wife's way of showing herself at her\\nease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her\\nreferences, so that, though her loveliness was an encouragement to\\nadmiration, her conversation was a chill to repartee.  The Vicar soon\\nabandoned the struggle; but the tutor, who spoke the most fluent and\\naccomplished English, gallantly continued to pour it out to her until\\nthe ladies, to the manifest relief of all concerned, went up to the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nThe Vicar, after a glass of port, was obliged to hurry away to a\\nmeeting, and the shy nephew, who appeared to be an invalid, was packed\\noff to bed.  But Archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine,\\nand suddenly Archer found himself talking as he had not done since his\\nlast symposium with Ned Winsett.  The Carfry nephew, it turned out, had\\nbeen threatened with consumption, and had had to leave Harrow for\\nSwitzerland, where he had spent two years in the milder air of Lake\\nLeman.  Being a bookish youth, he had been entrusted to M. Riviere, who\\nhad brought him back to England, and was to remain with him till he\\nwent up to Oxford the following spring; and M. Riviere added with\\nsimplicity that he should then have to look out for another job.\\n\\nIt seemed impossible, Archer thought, that he should be long without\\none, so varied were his interests and so many his gifts.  He was a man\\nof about thirty, with a thin ugly face (May would certainly have called\\nhim common-looking) to which the play of his ideas gave an intense\\nexpressiveness; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his\\nanimation.\\n\\nHis father, who had died young, had filled a small diplomatic post, and\\nit had been intended that the son should follow the same career; but an\\ninsatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism,\\nthen into authorship (apparently unsuccessful), and at length--after\\nother experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener--into\\ntutoring English youths in Switzerland.  Before that, however, he had\\nlived much in Paris, frequented the Goncourt grenier, been advised by\\nMaupassant not to attempt to write (even that seemed to Archer a\\ndazzling honour!), and had often talked with Merimee in his mother's\\nhouse.  He had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious\\n(having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for), and it was\\napparent that his literary ambitions had failed.  His situation, in\\nfact, seemed, materially speaking, no more brilliant than Ned\\nWinsett's; but he had lived in a world in which, as he said, no one who\\nloved ideas need hunger mentally.  As it was precisely of that love\\nthat poor Winsett was starving to death, Archer looked with a sort of\\nvicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so\\nrichly in his poverty.\\n\\n\\\"You see, Monsieur, it's worth everything, isn't it, to keep one's\\nintellectual liberty, not to enslave one's powers of appreciation,\\none's critical independence?  It was because of that that I abandoned\\njournalism, and took to so much duller work: tutoring and private\\nsecretaryship.  There is a good deal of drudgery, of course; but one\\npreserves one's moral freedom, what we call in French one's quant a\\nsoi.  And when one hears good talk one can join in it without\\ncompromising any opinions but one's own; or one can listen, and answer\\nit inwardly.  Ah, good conversation--there's nothing like it, is there?\\nThe air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.  And so I have never\\nregretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism--two different forms\\nof the same self-abdication.\\\"  He fixed his vivid eyes on Archer as he\\nlit another cigarette.  \\\"Voyez-vous, Monsieur, to be able to look life\\nin the face: that's worth living in a garret for, isn't it?  But, after\\nall, one must earn enough to pay for the garret; and I confess that to\\ngrow old as a private tutor--or a 'private' anything--is almost as\\nchilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at Bucharest.\\nSometimes I feel I must make a plunge: an immense plunge.  Do you\\nsuppose, for instance, there would be any opening for me in America--in\\nNew York?\\\"\\n\\nArcher looked at him with startled eyes.  New York, for a young man who\\nhad frequented the Goncourts and Flaubert, and who thought the life of\\nideas the only one worth living!  He continued to stare at M.  Riviere\\nperplexedly, wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and\\nadvantages would be the surest hindrance to success.\\n\\n\\\"New York--New York--but must it be especially New York?\\\" he stammered,\\nutterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could\\noffer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only\\nnecessity.\\n\\nA sudden flush rose under M. Riviere's sallow skin.  \\\"I--I thought it\\nyour metropolis: is not the intellectual life more active there?\\\" he\\nrejoined; then, as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of\\nhaving asked a favour, he went on hastily:  \\\"One throws out random\\nsuggestions--more to one's self than to others.  In reality, I see no\\nimmediate prospect--\\\" and rising from his seat he added, without a\\ntrace of constraint:  \\\"But Mrs. Carfry will think that I ought to be\\ntaking you upstairs.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the homeward drive Archer pondered deeply on this episode.  His\\nhour with M. Riviere had put new air into his lungs, and his first\\nimpulse had been to invite him to dine the next day; but he was\\nbeginning to understand why married men did not always immediately\\nyield to their first impulses.\\n\\n\\\"That young tutor is an interesting fellow: we had some awfully good\\ntalk after dinner about books and things,\\\" he threw out tentatively in\\nthe hansom.\\n\\nMay roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had\\nread so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the\\nkey to them.\\n\\n\\\"The little Frenchman?  Wasn't he dreadfully common?\\\" she questioned\\ncoldly; and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at\\nhaving been invited out in London to meet a clergyman and a French\\ntutor.  The disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment\\nordinarily defined as snobbishness, but by old New York's sense of what\\nwas due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands.  If May's\\nparents had entertained the Carfrys in Fifth Avenue they would have\\noffered them something more substantial than a parson and a\\nschoolmaster.\\n\\nBut Archer was on edge, and took her up.\\n\\n\\\"Common--common WHERE?\\\" he queried; and she returned with unusual\\nreadiness:  \\\"Why, I should say anywhere but in his school-room.  Those\\npeople are always awkward in society.  But then,\\\" she added\\ndisarmingly, \\\"I suppose I shouldn't have known if he was clever.\\\"\\n\\nArcher disliked her use of the word \\\"clever\\\" almost as much as her use\\nof the word \\\"common\\\"; but he was beginning to fear his tendency to\\ndwell on the things he disliked in her.  After all, her point of view\\nhad always been the same.  It was that of all the people he had grown\\nup among, and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible.\\nUntil a few months ago he had never known a \\\"nice\\\" woman who looked at\\nlife differently; and if a man married it must necessarily be among the\\nnice.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--then I won't ask him to dine!\\\" he concluded with a laugh; and May\\nechoed, bewildered:  \\\"Goodness--ask the Carfrys' tutor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, not on the same day with the Carfrys, if you prefer I shouldn't.\\nBut I did rather want another talk with him.  He's looking for a job in\\nNew York.\\\"\\n\\nHer surprise increased with her indifference: he almost fancied that\\nshe suspected him of being tainted with \\\"foreignness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A job in New York?  What sort of a job?  People don't have French\\ntutors: what does he want to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Chiefly to enjoy good conversation, I understand,\\\" her husband\\nretorted perversely; and she broke into an appreciative laugh.  \\\"Oh,\\nNewland, how funny!  Isn't that FRENCH?\\\"\\n\\nOn the whole, he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her\\nrefusing to take seriously his wish to invite M. Riviere.  Another\\nafter-dinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of\\nNew York; and the more Archer considered it the less he was able to fit\\nM. Riviere into any conceivable picture of New York as he knew it.\\n\\nHe perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many\\nproblems would be thus negatively solved for him; but as he paid the\\nhansom and followed his wife's long train into the house he took refuge\\nin the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the\\nmost difficult in marriage.  \\\"After that I suppose we shall have pretty\\nnearly finished rubbing off each other's angles,\\\" he reflected; but the\\nworst of it was that May's pressure was already bearing on the very\\nangles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.\\n\\n\\nThe small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea.\\n\\nThe turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus, and\\ncast-iron vases painted in chocolate colour, standing at intervals\\nalong the winding path that led to the sea, looped their garlands of\\npetunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel.\\n\\nHalf way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house\\n(which was also chocolate-coloured, but with the tin roof of the\\nverandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning) two large\\ntargets had been placed against a background of shrubbery.  On the\\nother side of the lawn, facing the targets, was pitched a real tent,\\nwith benches and garden-seats about it.  A number of ladies in summer\\ndresses and gentlemen in grey frock-coats and tall hats stood on the\\nlawn or sat upon the benches; and every now and then a slender girl in\\nstarched muslin would step from the tent, bow in hand, and speed her\\nshaft at one of the targets, while the spectators interrupted their\\ntalk to watch the result.\\n\\nNewland Archer, standing on the verandah of the house, looked curiously\\ndown upon this scene.  On each side of the shiny painted steps was a\\nlarge blue china flower-pot on a bright yellow china stand.  A spiky\\ngreen plant filled each pot, and below the verandah ran a wide border\\nof blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums.  Behind him, the\\nFrench windows of the drawing-rooms through which he had passed gave\\nglimpses, between swaying lace curtains, of glassy parquet floors\\nislanded with chintz poufs, dwarf armchairs, and velvet tables covered\\nwith trifles in silver.\\n\\nThe Newport Archery Club always held its August meeting at the\\nBeauforts'.  The sport, which had hitherto known no rival but croquet,\\nwas beginning to be discarded in favour of lawn-tennis; but the latter\\ngame was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions,\\nand as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes\\nthe bow and arrow held their own.\\n\\nArcher looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle.  It surprised\\nhim that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions\\nto it had so completely changed.  It was Newport that had first brought\\nhome to him the extent of the change.  In New York, during the previous\\nwinter, after he and May had settled down in the new greenish-yellow\\nhouse with the bow-window and the Pompeian vestibule, he had dropped\\nback with relief into the old routine of the office, and the renewal of\\nthis daily activity had served as a link with his former self.  Then\\nthere had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey\\nstepper for May's brougham (the Wellands had given the carriage), and\\nthe abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library,\\nwhich, in spite of family doubts and disapprovals, had been carried out\\nas he had dreamed, with a dark embossed paper, Eastlake book-cases and\\n\\\"sincere\\\" arm-chairs and tables.  At the Century he had found Winsett\\nagain, and at the Knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own\\nset; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to\\ndining out or entertaining friends at home, with an occasional evening\\nat the Opera or the play, the life he was living had still seemed a\\nfairly real and inevitable sort of business.\\n\\nBut Newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of\\nunmitigated holiday-making.  Archer had tried to persuade May to spend\\nthe summer on a remote island off the coast of Maine (called,\\nappropriately enough, Mount Desert), where a few hardy Bostonians and\\nPhiladelphians were camping in \\\"native\\\" cottages, and whence came\\nreports of enchanting scenery and a wild, almost trapper-like existence\\namid woods and waters.\\n\\nBut the Wellands always went to Newport, where they owned one of the\\nsquare boxes on the cliffs, and their son-in-law could adduce no good\\nreason why he and May should not join them there.  As Mrs. Welland\\nrather tartly pointed out, it was hardly worth while for May to have\\nworn herself out trying on summer clothes in Paris if she was not to be\\nallowed to wear them; and this argument was of a kind to which Archer\\nhad as yet found no answer.\\n\\nMay herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with\\nso reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer.  She reminded\\nhim that he had always liked Newport in his bachelor days, and as this\\nwas indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to\\nlike it better than ever now that they were to be there together.  But\\nas he stood on the Beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly\\npeopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to\\nlike it at all.\\n\\nIt was not May's fault, poor dear.  If, now and then, during their\\ntravels, they had fallen slightly out of step, harmony had been\\nrestored by their return to the conditions she was used to.  He had\\nalways foreseen that she would not disappoint him; and he had been\\nright.  He had married (as most young men did) because he had met a\\nperfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless\\nsentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust; and she had\\nrepresented peace, stability, comradeship, and the steadying sense of\\nan unescapable duty.\\n\\nHe could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice, for she had\\nfulfilled all that he had expected.  It was undoubtedly gratifying to\\nbe the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married\\nwomen in New York, especially when she was also one of the\\nsweetest-tempered and most reasonable of wives; and Archer had never\\nbeen insensible to such advantages.  As for the momentary madness which\\nhad fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage, he had trained himself\\nto regard it as the last of his discarded experiments.  The idea that\\nhe could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying the Countess\\nOlenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory\\nsimply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.\\n\\nBut all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather\\nempty and echoing place, and he supposed that was one of the reasons\\nwhy the busy animated people on the Beaufort lawn shocked him as if\\nthey had been children playing in a grave-yard.\\n\\nHe heard a murmur of skirts beside him, and the Marchioness Manson\\nfluttered out of the drawing-room window.  As usual, she was\\nextraordinarily festooned and bedizened, with a limp Leghorn hat\\nanchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze, and a little\\nblack velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over\\nher much larger hatbrim.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Newland, I had no idea that you and May had arrived!  You\\nyourself came only yesterday, you say?  Ah,\\nbusiness--business--professional duties ... I understand.  Many\\nhusbands, I know, find it impossible to join their wives here except\\nfor the week-end.\\\"  She cocked her head on one side and languished at\\nhim through screwed-up eyes.  \\\"But marriage is one long sacrifice, as I\\nused often to remind my Ellen--\\\"\\n\\nArcher's heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once\\nbefore, and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and\\nthe outer world; but this break of continuity must have been of the\\nbriefest, for he presently heard Medora answering a question he had\\napparently found voice to put.\\n\\n\\\"No, I am not staying here, but with the Blenkers, in their delicious\\nsolitude at Portsmouth.  Beaufort was kind enough to send his famous\\ntrotters for me this morning, so that I might have at least a glimpse\\nof one of Regina's garden-parties; but this evening I go back to rural\\nlife.  The Blenkers, dear original beings, have hired a primitive old\\nfarm-house at Portsmouth where they gather about them representative\\npeople ...\\\"  She drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim, and\\nadded with a faint blush:  \\\"This week Dr. Agathon Carver is holding a\\nseries of Inner Thought meetings there.  A contrast indeed to this gay\\nscene of worldly pleasure--but then I have always lived on contrasts!\\nTo me the only death is monotony.  I always say to Ellen: Beware of\\nmonotony; it's the mother of all the deadly sins.  But my poor child is\\ngoing through a phase of exaltation, of abhorrence of the world.  You\\nknow, I suppose, that she has declined all invitations to stay at\\nNewport, even with her grandmother Mingott?  I could hardly persuade\\nher to come with me to the Blenkers', if you will believe it!  The life\\nshe leads is morbid, unnatural.  Ah, if she had only listened to me\\nwhen it was still possible ... When the door was still open ... But\\nshall we go down and watch this absorbing match?  I hear your May is\\none of the competitors.\\\"\\n\\nStrolling toward them from the tent Beaufort advanced over the lawn,\\ntall, heavy, too tightly buttoned into a London frock-coat, with one of\\nhis own orchids in its buttonhole.  Archer, who had not seen him for\\ntwo or three months, was struck by the change in his appearance.  In\\nthe hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but\\nfor his erect square-shouldered walk he would have looked like an\\nover-fed and over-dressed old man.\\n\\nThere were all sorts of rumours afloat about Beaufort.  In the spring\\nhe had gone off on a long cruise to the West Indies in his new\\nsteam-yacht, and it was reported that, at various points where he had\\ntouched, a lady resembling Miss Fanny Ring had been seen in his\\ncompany.  The steam-yacht, built in the Clyde, and fitted with tiled\\nbath-rooms and other unheard-of luxuries, was said to have cost him\\nhalf a million; and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his\\nwife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are\\napt to be.  Beaufort's fortune was substantial enough to stand the\\nstrain; and yet the disquieting rumours persisted, not only in Fifth\\nAvenue but in Wall Street.  Some people said he had speculated\\nunfortunately in railways, others that he was being bled by one of the\\nmost insatiable members of her profession; and to every report of\\nthreatened insolvency Beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance: the\\nbuilding of a new row of orchid-houses, the purchase of a new string of\\nrace-horses, or the addition of a new Meissonnier or Cabanel to his\\npicture-gallery.\\n\\nHe advanced toward the Marchioness and Newland with his usual\\nhalf-sneering smile.  \\\"Hullo, Medora!  Did the trotters do their\\nbusiness?  Forty minutes, eh?  ...  Well, that's not so bad,\\nconsidering your nerves had to be spared.\\\"  He shook hands with Archer,\\nand then, turning back with them, placed himself on Mrs. Manson's other\\nside, and said, in a low voice, a few words which their companion did\\nnot catch.\\n\\nThe Marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks, and a \\\"Que\\nvoulez-vous?\\\" which deepened Beaufort's frown; but he produced a good\\nsemblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at Archer to say:\\n\\\"You know May's going to carry off the first prize.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, then it remains in the family,\\\" Medora rippled; and at that moment\\nthey reached the tent and Mrs. Beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of\\nmauve muslin and floating veils.\\n\\nMay Welland was just coming out of the tent.  In her white dress, with\\na pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat, she\\nhad the same Diana-like aloofness as when she had entered the Beaufort\\nball-room on the night of her engagement.  In the interval not a\\nthought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her\\nheart; and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both\\nhe marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from\\nher.\\n\\nShe had her bow and arrow in her hand, and placing herself on the\\nchalk-mark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and\\ntook aim.  The attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of\\nappreciation followed her appearance, and Archer felt the glow of\\nproprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary well-being.\\nHer rivals--Mrs. Reggie Chivers, the Merry girls, and divers rosy\\nThorleys, Dagonets and Mingotts, stood behind her in a lovely anxious\\ngroup, brown heads and golden bent above the scores, and pale muslins\\nand flower-wreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow.  All were young\\nand pretty, and bathed in summer bloom; but not one had the nymph-like\\nease of his wife, when, with tense muscles and happy frown, she bent\\nher soul upon some feat of strength.\\n\\n\\\"Gad,\\\" Archer heard Lawrence Lefferts say, \\\"not one of the lot holds\\nthe bow as she does\\\"; and Beaufort retorted:  \\\"Yes; but that's the only\\nkind of target she'll ever hit.\\\"\\n\\nArcher felt irrationally angry.  His host's contemptuous tribute to\\nMay's \\\"niceness\\\" was just what a husband should have wished to hear\\nsaid of his wife.  The fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking\\nin attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words\\nsent a faint shiver through his heart.  What if \\\"niceness\\\" carried to\\nthat supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an\\nemptiness?  As he looked at May, returning flushed and calm from her\\nfinal bull's-eye, he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that\\ncurtain.\\n\\nShe took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the\\ncompany with the simplicity that was her crowning grace.  No one could\\never be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling\\nthat she would have been just as serene if she had missed them.  But\\nwhen her eyes met her husband's her face glowed with the pleasure she\\nsaw in his.\\n\\nMrs. Welland's basket-work pony-carriage was waiting for them, and they\\ndrove off among the dispersing carriages, May handling the reins and\\nArcher sitting at her side.\\n\\nThe afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and\\nshrubberies, and up and down Bellevue Avenue rolled a double line of\\nvictorias, dog-carts, landaus and \\\"vis-a-vis,\\\" carrying well-dressed\\nladies and gentlemen away from the Beaufort garden-party, or homeward\\nfrom their daily afternoon turn along the Ocean Drive.\\n\\n\\\"Shall we go to see Granny?\\\" May suddenly proposed.  \\\"I should like to\\ntell her myself that I've won the prize.  There's lots of time before\\ndinner.\\\"\\n\\nArcher acquiesced, and she turned the ponies down Narragansett Avenue,\\ncrossed Spring Street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond.\\nIn this unfashionable region Catherine the Great, always indifferent to\\nprecedent and thrifty of purse, had built herself in her youth a\\nmany-peaked and cross-beamed cottage-orne on a bit of cheap land\\noverlooking the bay.  Here, in a thicket of stunted oaks, her verandahs\\nspread themselves above the island-dotted waters.  A winding drive led\\nup between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of\\ngeraniums to a front door of highly-varnished walnut under a striped\\nverandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow\\nstar-patterned parquet floor, upon which opened four small square rooms\\nwith heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an Italian\\nhouse-painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus.  One of these\\nrooms had been turned into a bedroom by Mrs. Mingott when the burden of\\nflesh descended on her, and in the adjoining one she spent her days,\\nenthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window, and\\nperpetually waving a palm-leaf fan which the prodigious projection of\\nher bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set\\nin motion stirred only the fringe of the anti-macassars on the\\nchair-arms.\\n\\nSince she had been the means of hastening his marriage old Catherine\\nhad shown to Archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites\\ntoward the person served.  She was persuaded that irrepressible passion\\nwas the cause of his impatience; and being an ardent admirer of\\nimpulsiveness (when it did not lead to the spending of money) she\\nalways received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of\\nallusion to which May seemed fortunately impervious.\\n\\nShe examined and appraised with much interest the diamond-tipped arrow\\nwhich had been pinned on May's bosom at the conclusion of the match,\\nremarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought\\nenough, but that there was no denying that Beaufort did things\\nhandsomely.\\n\\n\\\"Quite an heirloom, in fact, my dear,\\\" the old lady chuckled.  \\\"You\\nmust leave it in fee to your eldest girl.\\\" She pinched May's white arm\\nand watched the colour flood her face.  \\\"Well, well, what have I said\\nto make you shake out the red flag?  Ain't there going to be any\\ndaughters--only boys, eh?  Good gracious, look at her blushing again\\nall over her blushes!  What--can't I say that either?  Mercy me--when\\nmy children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out\\noverhead I always say I'm too thankful to have somebody about me that\\nNOTHING can shock!\\\"\\n\\nArcher burst into a laugh, and May echoed it, crimson to the eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Well, now tell me all about the party, please, my dears, for I shall\\nnever get a straight word about it out of that silly Medora,\\\" the\\nancestress continued; and, as May exclaimed:  \\\"Cousin Medora?  But I\\nthought she was going back to Portsmouth?\\\" she answered placidly: \\\"So\\nshe is--but she's got to come here first to pick up Ellen.  Ah--you\\ndidn't know Ellen had come to spend the day with me?  Such fol-de-rol,\\nher not coming for the summer; but I gave up arguing with young people\\nabout fifty years ago.  Ellen--ELLEN!\\\" she cried in her shrill old\\nvoice, trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn\\nbeyond the verandah.\\n\\nThere was no answer, and Mrs. Mingott rapped impatiently with her stick\\non the shiny floor.  A mulatto maid-servant in a bright turban,\\nreplying to the summons, informed her mistress that she had seen \\\"Miss\\nEllen\\\" going down the path to the shore; and Mrs. Mingott turned to\\nArcher.\\n\\n\\\"Run down and fetch her, like a good grandson; this pretty lady will\\ndescribe the party to me,\\\" she said; and Archer stood up as if in a\\ndream.\\n\\nHe had heard the Countess Olenska's name pronounced often enough during\\nthe year and a half since they had last met, and was even familiar with\\nthe main incidents of her life in the interval.  He knew that she had\\nspent the previous summer at Newport, where she appeared to have gone a\\ngreat deal into society, but that in the autumn she had suddenly\\nsub-let the \\\"perfect house\\\" which Beaufort had been at such pains to\\nfind for her, and decided to establish herself in Washington.  There,\\nduring the winter, he had heard of her (as one always heard of pretty\\nwomen in Washington) as shining in the \\\"brilliant diplomatic society\\\"\\nthat was supposed to make up for the social short-comings of the\\nAdministration.  He had listened to these accounts, and to various\\ncontradictory reports on her appearance, her conversation, her point of\\nview and her choice of friends, with the detachment with which one\\nlistens to reminiscences of some one long since dead; not till Medora\\nsuddenly spoke her name at the archery match had Ellen Olenska become a\\nliving presence to him again.  The Marchioness's foolish lisp had\\ncalled up a vision of the little fire-lit drawing-room and the sound of\\nthe carriage-wheels returning down the deserted street.  He thought of\\na story he had read, of some peasant children in Tuscany lighting a\\nbunch of straw in a wayside cavern, and revealing old silent images in\\ntheir painted tomb ...\\n\\nThe way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was\\nperched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows.\\nThrough their veil Archer caught the glint of the Lime Rock, with its\\nwhite-washed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic light-house\\nkeeper, Ida Lewis, was living her last venerable years.  Beyond it lay\\nthe flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of Goat Island, the bay\\nspreading northward in a shimmer of gold to Prudence Island with its\\nlow growth of oaks, and the shores of Conanicut faint in the sunset\\nhaze.\\n\\nFrom the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of\\npagoda-like summer-house; and in the pagoda a lady stood, leaning\\nagainst the rail, her back to the shore.  Archer stopped at the sight\\nas if he had waked from sleep.  That vision of the past was a dream,\\nand the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead:\\nwas Mrs. Welland's pony-carriage circling around and around the oval at\\nthe door, was May sitting under the shameless Olympians and glowing\\nwith secret hopes, was the Welland villa at the far end of Bellevue\\nAvenue, and Mr. Welland, already dressed for dinner, and pacing the\\ndrawing-room floor, watch in hand, with dyspeptic impatience--for it\\nwas one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is\\nhappening at a given hour.\\n\\n\\\"What am I?  A son-in-law--\\\" Archer thought.\\n\\nThe figure at the end of the pier had not moved.  For a long moment the\\nyoung man stood half way down the bank, gazing at the bay furrowed with\\nthe coming and going of sailboats, yacht-launches, fishing-craft and\\nthe trailing black coal-barges hauled by noisy tugs.  The lady in the\\nsummer-house seemed to be held by the same sight.  Beyond the grey\\nbastions of Fort Adams a long-drawn sunset was splintering up into a\\nthousand fires, and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it\\nbeat out through the channel between the Lime Rock and the shore.\\nArcher, as he watched, remembered the scene in the Shaughraun, and\\nMontague lifting Ada Dyas's ribbon to his lips without her knowing that\\nhe was in the room.\\n\\n\\\"She doesn't know--she hasn't guessed.  Shouldn't I know if she came up\\nbehind me, I wonder?\\\" he mused; and suddenly he said to himself:  \\\"If\\nshe doesn't turn before that sail crosses the Lime Rock light I'll go\\nback.\\\"\\n\\nThe boat was gliding out on the receding tide.  It slid before the Lime\\nRock, blotted out Ida Lewis's little house, and passed across the\\nturret in which the light was hung.  Archer waited till a wide space of\\nwater sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the\\nboat; but still the figure in the summer-house did not move.\\n\\nHe turned and walked up the hill.\\n\\n\\n\\\"I'm sorry you didn't find Ellen--I should have liked to see her\\nagain,\\\" May said as they drove home through the dusk.  \\\"But perhaps she\\nwouldn't have cared--she seems so changed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Changed?\\\" echoed her husband in a colourless voice, his eyes fixed on\\nthe ponies' twitching ears.\\n\\n\\\"So indifferent to her friends, I mean; giving up New York and her\\nhouse, and spending her time with such queer people.  Fancy how\\nhideously uncomfortable she must be at the Blenkers'!  She says she\\ndoes it to keep cousin Medora out of mischief: to prevent her marrying\\ndreadful people.  But I sometimes think we've always bored her.\\\"\\n\\nArcher made no answer, and she continued, with a tinge of hardness that\\nhe had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice:  \\\"After all, I\\nwonder if she wouldn't be happier with her husband.\\\"\\n\\nHe burst into a laugh.  \\\"Sancta simplicitas!\\\" he exclaimed; and as she\\nturned a puzzled frown on him he added:  \\\"I don't think I ever heard\\nyou say a cruel thing before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Cruel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a\\nfavourite sport of the angels; but I believe even they don't think\\npeople happier in hell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's a pity she ever married abroad then,\\\" said May, in the placid\\ntone with which her mother met Mr. Welland's vagaries; and Archer felt\\nhimself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands.\\n\\nThey drove down Bellevue Avenue and turned in between the chamfered\\nwooden gate-posts surmounted by cast-iron lamps which marked the\\napproach to the Welland villa.  Lights were already shining through its\\nwindows, and Archer, as the carriage stopped, caught a glimpse of his\\nfather-in-law, exactly as he had pictured him, pacing the drawing-room,\\nwatch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since\\nfound to be much more efficacious than anger.\\n\\nThe young man, as he followed his wife into the hall, was conscious of\\na curious reversal of mood.  There was something about the luxury of\\nthe Welland house and the density of the Welland atmosphere, so charged\\nwith minute observances and exactions, that always stole into his\\nsystem like a narcotic.  The heavy carpets, the watchful servants, the\\nperpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks, the perpetually\\nrenewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table, the whole\\nchain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next, and each\\nmember of the household to all the others, made any less systematised\\nand affluent existence seem unreal and precarious.  But now it was the\\nWelland house, and the life he was expected to lead in it, that had\\nbecome unreal and irrelevant, and the brief scene on the shore, when he\\nhad stood irresolute, halfway down the bank, was as close to him as the\\nblood in his veins.\\n\\nAll night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at May's side,\\nwatching the moonlight slant along the carpet, and thinking of Ellen\\nOlenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind Beaufort's\\ntrotters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"A party for the Blenkers--the Blenkers?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Welland laid down his knife and fork and looked anxiously and\\nincredulously across the luncheon-table at his wife, who, adjusting her\\ngold eye-glasses, read aloud, in the tone of high comedy:\\n\\n\\\"Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure of Mr. and\\nMrs. Welland's company at the meeting of the Wednesday Afternoon Club\\non August 25th at 3 o'clock punctually.  To meet Mrs. and the Misses\\nBlenker.\\n\\n\\\"Red Gables, Catherine Street.  R. S. V. P.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Good gracious--\\\" Mr. Welland gasped, as if a second reading had been\\nnecessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Amy Sillerton--you never can tell what her husband will do next,\\\"\\nMrs. Welland sighed.  \\\"I suppose he's just discovered the Blenkers.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Emerson Sillerton was a thorn in the side of Newport society;\\nand a thorn that could not be plucked out, for it grew on a venerable\\nand venerated family tree.  He was, as people said, a man who had had\\n\\\"every advantage.\\\"  His father was Sillerton Jackson's uncle, his\\nmother a Pennilow of Boston; on each side there was wealth and\\nposition, and mutual suitability.  Nothing--as Mrs. Welland had often\\nremarked--nothing on earth obliged Emerson Sillerton to be an\\narchaeologist, or indeed a Professor of any sort, or to live in Newport\\nin winter, or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did.\\nBut at least, if he was going to break with tradition and flout society\\nin the face, he need not have married poor Amy Dagonet, who had a right\\nto expect \\\"something different,\\\" and money enough to keep her own\\ncarriage.\\n\\nNo one in the Mingott set could understand why Amy Sillerton had\\nsubmitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the\\nhouse with long-haired men and short-haired women, and, when he\\ntravelled, took her to explore tombs in Yucatan instead of going to\\nParis or Italy.  But there they were, set in their ways, and apparently\\nunaware that they were different from other people; and when they gave\\none of their dreary annual garden-parties every family on the Cliffs,\\nbecause of the Sillerton-Pennilow-Dagonet connection, had to draw lots\\nand send an unwilling representative.\\n\\n\\\"It's a wonder,\\\" Mrs. Welland remarked, \\\"that they didn't choose the\\nCup Race day!  Do you remember, two years ago, their giving a party for\\na black man on the day of Julia Mingott's the dansant?  Luckily this\\ntime there's nothing else going on that I know of--for of course some\\nof us will have to go.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Welland sighed nervously.  \\\"'Some of us,' my dear--more than one?\\nThree o'clock is such a very awkward hour.  I have to be here at\\nhalf-past three to take my drops: it's really no use trying to follow\\nBencomb's new treatment if I don't do it systematically; and if I join\\nyou later, of course I shall miss my drive.\\\"  At the thought he laid\\ndown his knife and fork again, and a flush of anxiety rose to his\\nfinely-wrinkled cheek.\\n\\n\\\"There's no reason why you should go at all, my dear,\\\" his wife\\nanswered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic.  \\\"I have some\\ncards to leave at the other end of Bellevue Avenue, and I'll drop in at\\nabout half-past three and stay long enough to make poor Amy feel that\\nshe hasn't been slighted.\\\"  She glanced hesitatingly at her daughter.\\n\\\"And if Newland's afternoon is provided for perhaps May can drive you\\nout with the ponies, and try their new russet harness.\\\"\\n\\nIt was a principle in the Welland family that people's days and hours\\nshould be what Mrs. Welland called \\\"provided for.\\\"  The melancholy\\npossibility of having to \\\"kill time\\\" (especially for those who did not\\ncare for whist or solitaire) was a vision that haunted her as the\\nspectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist.  Another of her\\nprinciples was that parents should never (at least visibly) interfere\\nwith the plans of their married children; and the difficulty of\\nadjusting this respect for May's independence with the exigency of Mr.\\nWelland's claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity\\nwhich left not a second of Mrs. Welland's own time unprovided for.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I'll drive with Papa--I'm sure Newland will find something\\nto do,\\\" May said, in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his\\nlack of response.  It was a cause of constant distress to Mrs. Welland\\nthat her son-in-law showed so little foresight in planning his days.\\nOften already, during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof,\\nwhen she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon, he had answered\\nparadoxically:  \\\"Oh, I think for a change I'll just save it instead of\\nspending it--\\\" and once, when she and May had had to go on a\\nlong-postponed round of afternoon calls, he had confessed to having\\nlain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house.\\n\\n\\\"Newland never seems to look ahead,\\\" Mrs. Welland once ventured to\\ncomplain to her daughter; and May answered serenely:  \\\"No; but you see\\nit doesn't matter, because when there's nothing particular to do he\\nreads a book.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, yes--like his father!\\\" Mrs. Welland agreed, as if allowing for an\\ninherited oddity; and after that the question of Newland's unemployment\\nwas tacitly dropped.\\n\\nNevertheless, as the day for the Sillerton reception approached, May\\nbegan to show a natural solicitude for his welfare, and to suggest a\\ntennis match at the Chiverses', or a sail on Julius Beaufort's cutter,\\nas a means of atoning for her temporary desertion.  \\\"I shall be back by\\nsix, you know, dear: Papa never drives later than that--\\\" and she was\\nnot reassured till Archer said that he thought of hiring a run-about\\nand driving up the island to a stud-farm to look at a second horse for\\nher brougham.  They had been looking for this horse for some time, and\\nthe suggestion was so acceptable that May glanced at her mother as if\\nto say:  \\\"You see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of\\nus.\\\"\\n\\nThe idea of the stud-farm and the brougham horse had germinated in\\nArcher's mind on the very day when the Emerson Sillerton invitation had\\nfirst been mentioned; but he had kept it to himself as if there were\\nsomething clandestine in the plan, and discovery might prevent its\\nexecution.  He had, however, taken the precaution to engage in advance\\na runabout with a pair of old livery-stable trotters that could still\\ndo their eighteen miles on level roads; and at two o'clock, hastily\\ndeserting the luncheon-table, he sprang into the light carriage and\\ndrove off.\\n\\nThe day was perfect.  A breeze from the north drove little puffs of\\nwhite cloud across an ultramarine sky, with a bright sea running under\\nit.  Bellevue Avenue was empty at that hour, and after dropping the\\nstable-lad at the corner of Mill Street Archer turned down the Old\\nBeach Road and drove across Eastman's Beach.\\n\\nHe had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which, on\\nhalf-holidays at school, he used to start off into the unknown.  Taking\\nhis pair at an easy gait, he counted on reaching the stud-farm, which\\nwas not far beyond Paradise Rocks, before three o'clock; so that, after\\nlooking over the horse (and trying him if he seemed promising) he would\\nstill have four golden hours to dispose of.\\n\\nAs soon as he heard of the Sillerton's party he had said to himself\\nthat the Marchioness Manson would certainly come to Newport with the\\nBlenkers, and that Madame Olenska might again take the opportunity of\\nspending the day with her grandmother.  At any rate, the Blenker\\nhabitation would probably be deserted, and he would be able, without\\nindiscretion, to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it.  He was not\\nsure that he wanted to see the Countess Olenska again; but ever since\\nhe had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted,\\nirrationally and indescribably, to see the place she was living in, and\\nto follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the\\nreal one in the summer-house.  The longing was with him day and night,\\nan incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man\\nfor food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten.  He could not\\nsee beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was\\nnot conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her\\nvoice.  He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the\\nspot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it,\\nthe rest of the world might seem less empty.\\n\\nWhen he reached the stud-farm a glance showed him that the horse was\\nnot what he wanted; nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to\\nprove to himself that he was not in a hurry.  But at three o'clock he\\nshook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by-roads\\nleading to Portsmouth.  The wind had dropped and a faint haze on the\\nhorizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the Saconnet on the\\nturn of the tide; but all about him fields and woods were steeped in\\ngolden light.\\n\\nHe drove past grey-shingled farm-houses in orchards, past hay-fields\\nand groves of oak, past villages with white steeples rising sharply\\ninto the fading sky; and at last, after stopping to ask the way of some\\nmen at work in a field, he turned down a lane between high banks of\\ngoldenrod and brambles.  At the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of\\nthe river; to the left, standing in front of a clump of oaks and\\nmaples, he saw a long tumble-down house with white paint peeling from\\nits clapboards.\\n\\nOn the road-side facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in\\nwhich the New Englander shelters his farming implements and visitors\\n\\\"hitch\\\" their \\\"teams.\\\" Archer, jumping down, led his pair into the\\nshed, and after tying them to a post turned toward the house.  The\\npatch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hay-field; but to the left\\nan overgrown box-garden full of dahlias and rusty rose-bushes encircled\\na ghostly summer-house of trellis-work that had once been white,\\nsurmounted by a wooden Cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but\\ncontinued to take ineffectual aim.\\n\\nArcher leaned for a while against the gate.  No one was in sight, and\\nnot a sound came from the open windows of the house: a grizzled\\nNewfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as\\nthe arrowless Cupid.  It was strange to think that this place of\\nsilence and decay was the home of the turbulent Blenkers; yet Archer\\nwas sure that he was not mistaken.\\n\\nFor a long time he stood there, content to take in the scene, and\\ngradually falling under its drowsy spell; but at length he roused\\nhimself to the sense of the passing time.  Should he look his fill and\\nthen drive away?  He stood irresolute, wishing suddenly to see the\\ninside of the house, so that he might picture the room that Madame\\nOlenska sat in.  There was nothing to prevent his walking up to the\\ndoor and ringing the bell; if, as he supposed, she was away with the\\nrest of the party, he could easily give his name, and ask permission to\\ngo into the sitting-room to write a message.\\n\\nBut instead, he crossed the lawn and turned toward the box-garden.  As\\nhe entered it he caught sight of something bright-coloured in the\\nsummer-house, and presently made it out to be a pink parasol.  The\\nparasol drew him like a magnet: he was sure it was hers.  He went into\\nthe summer-house, and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the\\nsilken thing and looked at its carved handle, which was made of some\\nrare wood that gave out an aromatic scent.  Archer lifted the handle to\\nhis lips.\\n\\nHe heard a rustle of skirts against the box, and sat motionless,\\nleaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands, and letting the\\nrustle come nearer without lifting his eyes.  He had always known that\\nthis must happen ...\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Mr. Archer!\\\" exclaimed a loud young voice; and looking up he saw\\nbefore him the youngest and largest of the Blenker girls, blonde and\\nblowsy, in bedraggled muslin.  A red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed\\nto show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow, and her\\nhalf-awakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly.\\n\\n\\\"Gracious--where did you drop from?  I must have been sound asleep in\\nthe hammock.  Everybody else has gone to Newport.  Did you ring?\\\" she\\nincoherently enquired.\\n\\nArcher's confusion was greater than hers.  \\\"I--no--that is, I was just\\ngoing to.  I had to come up the island to see about a horse, and I\\ndrove over on a chance of finding Mrs. Blenker and your visitors.  But\\nthe house seemed empty--so I sat down to wait.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Blenker, shaking off the fumes of sleep, looked at him with\\nincreasing interest.  \\\"The house IS empty.  Mother's not here, or the\\nMarchioness--or anybody but me.\\\"  Her glance became faintly\\nreproachful.  \\\"Didn't you know that Professor and Mrs. Sillerton are\\ngiving a garden-party for mother and all of us this afternoon?  It was\\ntoo unlucky that I couldn't go; but I've had a sore throat, and mother\\nwas afraid of the drive home this evening.  Did you ever know anything\\nso disappointing?  Of course,\\\" she added gaily, \\\"I shouldn't have\\nminded half as much if I'd known you were coming.\\\"\\n\\nSymptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her, and Archer\\nfound the strength to break in:  \\\"But Madame Olenska--has she gone to\\nNewport too?\\\"\\n\\nMiss Blenker looked at him with surprise.  \\\"Madame Olenska--didn't you\\nknow she'd been called away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Called away?--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my best parasol!  I lent it to that goose of a Katie, because it\\nmatched her ribbons, and the careless thing must have dropped it here.\\nWe Blenkers are all like that ... real Bohemians!\\\"  Recovering the\\nsunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy\\ndome above her head.  \\\"Yes, Ellen was called away yesterday: she lets\\nus call her Ellen, you know.  A telegram came from Boston: she said she\\nmight be gone for two days.  I do LOVE the way she does her hair, don't\\nyou?\\\" Miss Blenker rambled on.\\n\\nArcher continued to stare through her as though she had been\\ntransparent.  All he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its\\npinkness above her giggling head.\\n\\nAfter a moment he ventured:  \\\"You don't happen to know why Madame\\nOlenska went to Boston?  I hope it was not on account of bad news?\\\"\\n\\nMiss Blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity.  \\\"Oh, I don't\\nbelieve so.  She didn't tell us what was in the telegram.  I think she\\ndidn't want the Marchioness to know.  She's so romantic-looking, isn't\\nshe?  Doesn't she remind you of Mrs. Scott-Siddons when she reads 'Lady\\nGeraldine's Courtship'?  Did you never hear her?\\\"\\n\\nArcher was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts.  His whole future\\nseemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless\\nemptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever\\nto happen.  He glanced about him at the unpruned garden, the\\ntumble-down house, and the oak-grove under which the dusk was\\ngathering.  It had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to\\nhave found Madame Olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink\\nsunshade was not hers ...\\n\\nHe frowned and hesitated.  \\\"You don't know, I suppose--I shall be in\\nBoston tomorrow.  If I could manage to see her--\\\"\\n\\nHe felt that Miss Blenker was losing interest in him, though her smile\\npersisted.  \\\"Oh, of course; how lovely of you!  She's staying at the\\nParker House; it must be horrible there in this weather.\\\"\\n\\nAfter that Archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they\\nexchanged.  He could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that\\nhe should await the returning family and have high tea with them before\\nhe drove home.  At length, with his hostess still at his side, he\\npassed out of range of the wooden Cupid, unfastened his horses and\\ndrove off.  At the turn of the lane he saw Miss Blenker standing at the\\ngate and waving the pink parasol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next morning, when Archer got out of the Fall River train, he\\nemerged upon a steaming midsummer Boston.  The streets near the station\\nwere full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a\\nshirt-sleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of\\nboarders going down the passage to the bathroom.\\n\\nArcher found a cab and drove to the Somerset Club for breakfast.  Even\\nthe fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no\\nexcess of heat ever degrades the European cities.  Care-takers in\\ncalico lounged on the door-steps of the wealthy, and the Common looked\\nlike a pleasure-ground on the morrow of a Masonic picnic.  If Archer\\nhad tried to imagine Ellen Olenska in improbable scenes he could not\\nhave called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than\\nthis heat-prostrated and deserted Boston.\\n\\nHe breakfasted with appetite and method, beginning with a slice of\\nmelon, and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and\\nscrambled eggs.  A new sense of energy and activity had possessed him\\never since he had announced to May the night before that he had\\nbusiness in Boston, and should take the Fall River boat that night and\\ngo on to New York the following evening.  It had always been understood\\nthat he would return to town early in the week, and when he got back\\nfrom his expedition to Portsmouth a letter from the office, which fate\\nhad conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table, sufficed to\\njustify his sudden change of plan.  He was even ashamed of the ease\\nwith which the whole thing had been done: it reminded him, for an\\nuncomfortable moment, of Lawrence Lefferts's masterly contrivances for\\nsecuring his freedom.  But this did not long trouble him, for he was\\nnot in an analytic mood.\\n\\nAfter breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the Commercial\\nAdvertiser.  While he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came\\nin, and the usual greetings were exchanged: it was the same world after\\nall, though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the\\nmeshes of time and space.\\n\\nHe looked at his watch, and finding that it was half-past nine got up\\nand went into the writing-room.  There he wrote a few lines, and\\nordered a messenger to take a cab to the Parker House and wait for the\\nanswer.  He then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to\\ncalculate how long it would take a cab to get to the Parker House.\\n\\n\\\"The lady was out, sir,\\\" he suddenly heard a waiter's voice at his\\nelbow; and he stammered:  \\\"Out?--\\\" as if it were a word in a strange\\nlanguage.\\n\\nHe got up and went into the hall.  It must be a mistake: she could not\\nbe out at that hour.  He flushed with anger at his own stupidity: why\\nhad he not sent the note as soon as he arrived?\\n\\nHe found his hat and stick and went forth into the street.  The city\\nhad suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a\\ntraveller from distant lands.  For a moment he stood on the door-step\\nhesitating; then he decided to go to the Parker House.  What if the\\nmessenger had been misinformed, and she were still there?\\n\\nHe started to walk across the Common; and on the first bench, under a\\ntree, he saw her sitting.  She had a grey silk sunshade over her\\nhead--how could he ever have imagined her with a pink one?  As he\\napproached he was struck by her listless attitude: she sat there as if\\nshe had nothing else to do.  He saw her drooping profile, and the knot\\nof hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat, and the long\\nwrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade.  He came a step or\\ntwo nearer, and she turned and looked at him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh\\\"--she said; and for the first time he noticed a startled look on\\nher face; but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder\\nand contentment.\\n\\n\\\"Oh\\\"--she murmured again, on a different note, as he stood looking down\\nat her; and without rising she made a place for him on the bench.\\n\\n\\\"I'm here on business--just got here,\\\" Archer explained; and, without\\nknowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her.\\n\\\"But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?\\\"  He had really no\\nidea what he was saying: he felt as if he were shouting at her across\\nendless distances, and she might vanish again before he could overtake\\nher.\\n\\n\\\"I?  Oh, I'm here on business too,\\\" she answered, turning her head\\ntoward him so that they were face to face.  The words hardly reached\\nhim: he was aware only of her voice, and of the startling fact that not\\nan echo of it had remained in his memory.  He had not even remembered\\nthat it was low-pitched, with a faint roughness on the consonants.\\n\\n\\\"You do your hair differently,\\\" he said, his heart beating as if he had\\nuttered something irrevocable.\\n\\n\\\"Differently?  No--it's only that I do it as best I can when I'm\\nwithout Nastasia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nastasia; but isn't she with you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; I'm alone.  For two days it was not worth while to bring her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're alone--at the Parker House?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with a flash of her old malice.  \\\"Does it strike you\\nas dangerous?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; not dangerous--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But unconventional?  I see; I suppose it is.\\\"  She considered a\\nmoment.  \\\"I hadn't thought of it, because I've just done something so\\nmuch more unconventional.\\\" The faint tinge of irony lingered in her\\neyes.  \\\"I've just refused to take back a sum of money--that belonged to\\nme.\\\"\\n\\nArcher sprang up and moved a step or two away.  She had furled her\\nparasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel.  Presently he\\ncame back and stood before her.\\n\\n\\\"Some one--has come here to meet you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With this offer?\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\\\"And you refused--because of the conditions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I refused,\\\" she said after a moment.\\n\\nHe sat down by her again.  \\\"What were the conditions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, they were not onerous: just to sit at the head of his table now\\nand then.\\\"\\n\\nThere was another interval of silence.  Archer's heart had slammed\\nitself shut in the queer way it had, and he sat vainly groping for a\\nword.\\n\\n\\\"He wants you back--at any price?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--a considerable price.  At least the sum is considerable for me.\\\"\\n\\nHe paused again, beating about the question he felt he must put.\\n\\n\\\"It was to meet him here that you came?\\\"\\n\\nShe stared, and then burst into a laugh.  \\\"Meet him--my husband?  HERE?\\nAt this season he's always at Cowes or Baden.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He sent some one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With a letter?\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her head.  \\\"No; just a message.  He never writes.  I don't\\nthink I've had more than one letter from him.\\\"  The allusion brought\\nthe colour to her cheek, and it reflected itself in Archer's vivid\\nblush.\\n\\n\\\"Why does he never write?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should he?  What does one have secretaries for?\\\"\\n\\nThe young man's blush deepened.  She had pronounced the word as if it\\nhad no more significance than any other in her vocabulary.  For a\\nmoment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask:  \\\"Did he send his\\nsecretary, then?\\\"  But the remembrance of Count Olenski's only letter\\nto his wife was too present to him.  He paused again, and then took\\nanother plunge.\\n\\n\\\"And the person?\\\"--\\n\\n\\\"The emissary?  The emissary,\\\" Madame Olenska rejoined, still smiling,\\n\\\"might, for all I care, have left already; but he has insisted on\\nwaiting till this evening ... in case ... on the chance ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you came out here to think the chance over?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I came out to get a breath of air.  The hotel's too stifling.  I'm\\ntaking the afternoon train back to Portsmouth.\\\"\\n\\nThey sat silent, not looking at each other, but straight ahead at the\\npeople passing along the path.  Finally she turned her eyes again to\\nhis face and said:  \\\"You're not changed.\\\"\\n\\nHe felt like answering:  \\\"I was, till I saw you again;\\\" but instead he\\nstood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park.\\n\\n\\\"This is horrible.  Why shouldn't we go out a little on the bay?\\nThere's a breeze, and it will be cooler.  We might take the steamboat\\ndown to Point Arley.\\\"  She glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went\\non:  \\\"On a Monday morning there won't be anybody on the boat.  My train\\ndoesn't leave till evening: I'm going back to New York.  Why shouldn't\\nwe?\\\" he insisted, looking down at her; and suddenly he broke out:\\n\\\"Haven't we done all we could?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh\\\"--she murmured again.  She stood up and reopened her sunshade,\\nglancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure\\nherself of the impossibility of remaining in it.  Then her eyes\\nreturned to his face.  \\\"You mustn't say things like that to me,\\\" she\\nsaid.\\n\\n\\\"I'll say anything you like; or nothing.  I won't open my mouth unless\\nyou tell me to.  What harm can it do to anybody?  All I want is to\\nlisten to you,\\\" he stammered.\\n\\nShe drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enamelled chain.  \\\"Oh,\\ndon't calculate,\\\" he broke out; \\\"give me the day!  I want to get you\\naway from that man.  At what time was he coming?\\\"\\n\\nHer colour rose again.  \\\"At eleven.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you must come at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You needn't be afraid--if I don't come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor you either--if you do.  I swear I only want to hear about you, to\\nknow what you've been doing.  It's a hundred years since we've met--it\\nmay be another hundred before we meet again.\\\"\\n\\nShe still wavered, her anxious eyes on his face.  \\\"Why didn't you come\\ndown to the beach to fetch me, the day I was at Granny's?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Because you didn't look round--because you didn't know I was there.  I\\nswore I wouldn't unless you looked round.\\\"  He laughed as the\\nchildishness of the confession struck him.\\n\\n\\\"But I didn't look round on purpose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On purpose?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I knew you were there; when you drove in I recognised the ponies.  So\\nI went down to the beach.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To get away from me as far as you could?\\\"\\n\\nShe repeated in a low voice:  \\\"To get away from you as far as I could.\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed out again, this time in boyish satisfaction.  \\\"Well, you see\\nit's no use.  I may as well tell you,\\\" he added, \\\"that the business I\\ncame here for was just to find you.  But, look here, we must start or\\nwe shall miss our boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Our boat?\\\"  She frowned perplexedly, and then smiled.  \\\"Oh, but I must\\ngo back to the hotel first:  I must leave a note--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As many notes as you please.  You can write here.\\\" He drew out a\\nnote-case and one of the new stylographic pens.  \\\"I've even got an\\nenvelope--you see how everything's predestined!  There--steady the\\nthing on your knee, and I'll get the pen going in a second.  They have\\nto be humoured; wait--\\\"  He banged the hand that held the pen against\\nthe back of the bench.  \\\"It's like jerking down the mercury in a\\nthermometer: just a trick.  Now try--\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed, and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on\\nhis note-case, began to write.  Archer walked away a few steps, staring\\nwith radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby, who, in their turn, paused\\nto stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionably-dressed lady writing a\\nnote on her knee on a bench in the Common.\\n\\nMadame Olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope, wrote a name on it,\\nand put it into her pocket.  Then she too stood up.\\n\\nThey walked back toward Beacon Street, and near the club Archer caught\\nsight of the plush-lined \\\"herdic\\\" which had carried his note to the\\nParker House, and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing\\nhis brow at the corner hydrant.\\n\\n\\\"I told you everything was predestined!  Here's a cab for us.  You\\nsee!\\\"  They laughed, astonished at the miracle of picking up a public\\nconveyance at that hour, and in that unlikely spot, in a city where\\ncab-stands were still a \\\"foreign\\\" novelty.\\n\\nArcher, looking at his watch, saw that there was time to drive to the\\nParker House before going to the steamboat landing.  They rattled\\nthrough the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel.\\n\\nArcher held out his hand for the letter.  \\\"Shall I take it in?\\\" he\\nasked; but Madame Olenska, shaking her head, sprang out and disappeared\\nthrough the glazed doors.  It was barely half-past ten; but what if the\\nemissary, impatient for her reply, and not knowing how else to employ\\nhis time, were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks\\nat their elbows of whom Archer had caught a glimpse as she went in?\\n\\nHe waited, pacing up and down before the herdic.  A Sicilian youth with\\neyes like Nastasia's offered to shine his boots, and an Irish matron to\\nsell him peaches; and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot\\nmen with straw hats tilted far back, who glanced at him as they went\\nby.  He marvelled that the door should open so often, and that all the\\npeople it let out should look so like each other, and so like all the\\nother hot men who, at that hour, through the length and breadth of the\\nland, were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of\\nhotels.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, came a face that he could not relate to the other\\nfaces.  He caught but a flash of it, for his pacings had carried him to\\nthe farthest point of his beat, and it was in turning back to the hotel\\nthat he saw, in a group of typical countenances--the lank and weary,\\nthe round and surprised, the lantern-jawed and mild--this other face\\nthat was so many more things at once, and things so different.  It was\\nthat of a young man, pale too, and half-extinguished by the heat, or\\nworry, or both, but somehow, quicker, vivider, more conscious; or\\nperhaps seeming so because he was so different.  Archer hung a moment\\non a thin thread of memory, but it snapped and floated off with the\\ndisappearing face--apparently that of some foreign business man,\\nlooking doubly foreign in such a setting.  He vanished in the stream of\\npassersby, and Archer resumed his patrol.\\n\\nHe did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel, and\\nhis unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that, if\\nMadame Olenska was so long in reappearing, it could only be because she\\nhad met the emissary and been waylaid by him.  At the thought Archer's\\napprehension rose to anguish.\\n\\n\\\"If she doesn't come soon I'll go in and find her,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe doors swung open again and she was at his side.  They got into the\\nherdic, and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had\\nbeen absent just three minutes.  In the clatter of loose windows that\\nmade talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to\\nthe wharf.\\n\\n\\nSeated side by side on a bench of the half-empty boat they found that\\nthey had hardly anything to say to each other, or rather that what they\\nhad to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their\\nrelease and their isolation.\\n\\nAs the paddle-wheels began to turn, and wharves and shipping to recede\\nthrough the veil of heat, it seemed to Archer that everything in the\\nold familiar world of habit was receding also.  He longed to ask Madame\\nOlenska if she did not have the same feeling: the feeling that they\\nwere starting on some long voyage from which they might never return.\\nBut he was afraid to say it, or anything else that might disturb the\\ndelicate balance of her trust in him.  In reality he had no wish to\\nbetray that trust.  There had been days and nights when the memory of\\ntheir kiss had burned and burned on his lips; the day before even, on\\nthe drive to Portsmouth, the thought of her had run through him like\\nfire; but now that she was beside him, and they were drifting forth\\ninto this unknown world, they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper\\nnearness that a touch may sunder.\\n\\nAs the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about\\nthem and the bay broke up into long oily undulations, then into ripples\\ntipped with spray.  The fog of sultriness still hung over the city, but\\nahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters, and distant promontories\\nwith light-houses in the sun.  Madame Olenska, leaning back against the\\nboat-rail, drank in the coolness between parted lips.  She had wound a\\nlong veil about her hat, but it left her face uncovered, and Archer was\\nstruck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression.  She seemed to take\\ntheir adventure as a matter of course, and to be neither in fear of\\nunexpected encounters, nor (what was worse) unduly elated by their\\npossibility.\\n\\nIn the bare dining-room of the inn, which he had hoped they would have\\nto themselves, they found a strident party of innocent-looking young\\nmen and women--school-teachers on a holiday, the landlord told\\nthem--and Archer's heart sank at the idea of having to talk through\\ntheir noise.\\n\\n\\\"This is hopeless--I'll ask for a private room,\\\" he said; and Madame\\nOlenska, without offering any objection, waited while he went in search\\nof it.  The room opened on a long wooden verandah, with the sea coming\\nin at the windows.  It was bare and cool, with a table covered with a\\ncoarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a\\nblueberry pie under a cage.  No more guileless-looking cabinet\\nparticulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple: Archer\\nfancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile\\nwith which Madame Olenska sat down opposite to him.  A woman who had\\nrun away from her husband--and reputedly with another man--was likely\\nto have mastered the art of taking things for granted; but something in\\nthe quality of her composure took the edge from his irony.  By being so\\nquiet, so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the\\nconventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural\\nthing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey lunched slowly and meditatively, with mute intervals between\\nrushes of talk; for, the spell once broken, they had much to say, and\\nyet moments when saying became the mere accompaniment to long duologues\\nof silence.  Archer kept the talk from his own affairs, not with\\nconscious intention but because he did not want to miss a word of her\\nhistory; and leaning on the table, her chin resting on her clasped\\nhands, she talked to him of the year and a half since they had met.\\n\\nShe had grown tired of what people called \\\"society\\\"; New York was kind,\\nit was almost oppressively hospitable; she should never forget the way\\nin which it had welcomed her back; but after the first flush of novelty\\nshe had found herself, as she phrased it, too \\\"different\\\" to care for\\nthe things it cared about--and so she had decided to try Washington,\\nwhere one was supposed to meet more varieties of people and of opinion.\\nAnd on the whole she should probably settle down in Washington, and\\nmake a home there for poor Medora, who had worn out the patience of all\\nher other relations just at the time when she most needed looking after\\nand protecting from matrimonial perils.\\n\\n\\\"But Dr. Carver--aren't you afraid of Dr. Carver?  I hear he's been\\nstaying with you at the Blenkers'.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled.  \\\"Oh, the Carver danger is over.  Dr. Carver is a very\\nclever man.  He wants a rich wife to finance his plans, and Medora is\\nsimply a good advertisement as a convert.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A convert to what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To all sorts of new and crazy social schemes.  But, do you know, they\\ninterest me more than the blind conformity to tradition--somebody\\nelse's tradition--that I see among our own friends.  It seems stupid to\\nhave discovered America only to make it into a copy of another\\ncountry.\\\"  She smiled across the table.  \\\"Do you suppose Christopher\\nColumbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the Opera with\\nthe Selfridge Merrys?\\\"\\n\\nArcher changed colour.  \\\"And Beaufort--do you say these things to\\nBeaufort?\\\" he asked abruptly.\\n\\n\\\"I haven't seen him for a long time.  But I used to; and he\\nunderstands.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, it's what I've always told you; you don't like us. And you like\\nBeaufort because he's so unlike us.\\\" He looked about the bare room and\\nout at the bare beach and the row of stark white village houses strung\\nalong the shore.  \\\"We're damnably dull.  We've no character, no colour,\\nno variety.--I wonder,\\\" he broke out, \\\"why you don't go back?\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes darkened, and he expected an indignant rejoinder.  But she sat\\nsilent, as if thinking over what he had said, and he grew frightened\\nlest she should answer that she wondered too.\\n\\nAt length she said:  \\\"I believe it's because of you.\\\"\\n\\nIt was impossible to make the confession more dispassionately, or in a\\ntone less encouraging to the vanity of the person addressed.  Archer\\nreddened to the temples, but dared not move or speak: it was as if her\\nwords had been some rare butterfly that the least motion might drive\\noff on startled wings, but that might gather a flock about it if it\\nwere left undisturbed.\\n\\n\\\"At least,\\\" she continued, \\\"it was you who made me understand that\\nunder the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate\\nthat even those I most cared for in my other life look cheap in\\ncomparison.  I don't know how to explain myself\\\"--she drew together her\\ntroubled brows--\\\"but it seems as if I'd never before understood with\\nhow much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures\\nmay be paid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Exquisite pleasures--it's something to have had them!\\\" he felt like\\nretorting; but the appeal in her eyes kept him silent.\\n\\n\\\"I want,\\\" she went on, \\\"to be perfectly honest with you--and with\\nmyself.  For a long time I've hoped this chance would come: that I\\nmight tell you how you've helped me, what you've made of me--\\\"\\n\\nArcher sat staring beneath frowning brows.  He interrupted her with a\\nlaugh.  \\\"And what do you make out that you've made of me?\\\"\\n\\nShe paled a little.  \\\"Of you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes: for I'm of your making much more than you ever were of mine.  I'm\\nthe man who married one woman because another one told him to.\\\"\\n\\nHer paleness turned to a fugitive flush.  \\\"I thought--you promised--you\\nwere not to say such things today.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--how like a woman!  None of you will ever see a bad business\\nthrough!\\\"\\n\\nShe lowered her voice.  \\\"IS it a bad business--for May?\\\"\\n\\nHe stood in the window, drumming against the raised sash, and feeling\\nin every fibre the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her\\ncousin's name.\\n\\n\\\"For that's the thing we've always got to think of--haven't we--by your\\nown showing?\\\" she insisted.\\n\\n\\\"My own showing?\\\" he echoed, his blank eyes still on the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Or if not,\\\" she continued, pursuing her own thought with a painful\\napplication, \\\"if it's not worth while to have given up, to have missed\\nthings, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and\\nmisery--then everything I came home for, everything that made my other\\nlife seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took\\naccount of them--all these things are a sham or a dream--\\\"\\n\\nHe turned around without moving from his place.  \\\"And in that case\\nthere's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?\\\" he concluded for\\nher.\\n\\nHer eyes were clinging to him desperately.  \\\"Oh, IS there no reason?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage.  My\\nmarriage,\\\" he said savagely, \\\"isn't going to be a sight to keep you\\nhere.\\\"  She made no answer, and he went on:  \\\"What's the use?  You gave\\nme my first glimpse of a real life, and at the same moment you asked me\\nto go on with a sham one.  It's beyond human enduring--that's all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't say that; when I'm enduring it!\\\" she burst out, her eyes\\nfilling.\\n\\nHer arms had dropped along the table, and she sat with her face\\nabandoned to his gaze as if in the recklessness of a desperate peril.\\nThe face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person, with\\nthe soul behind it: Archer stood dumb, overwhelmed by what it suddenly\\ntold him.\\n\\n\\\"You too--oh, all this time, you too?\\\"\\n\\nFor answer, she let the tears on her lids overflow and run slowly\\ndownward.\\n\\nHalf the width of the room was still between them, and neither made any\\nshow of moving.  Archer was conscious of a curious indifference to her\\nbodily presence: he would hardly have been aware of it if one of the\\nhands she had flung out on the table had not drawn his gaze as on the\\noccasion when, in the little Twenty-third Street house, he had kept his\\neye on it in order not to look at her face.  Now his imagination spun\\nabout the hand as about the edge of a vortex; but still he made no\\neffort to draw nearer.  He had known the love that is fed on caresses\\nand feeds them; but this passion that was closer than his bones was not\\nto be superficially satisfied.  His one terror was to do anything which\\nmight efface the sound and impression of her words; his one thought,\\nthat he should never again feel quite alone.\\n\\nBut after a moment the sense of waste and ruin overcame him.  There\\nthey were, close together and safe and shut in; yet so chained to their\\nseparate destinies that they might as well have been half the world\\napart.\\n\\n\\\"What's the use--when you will go back?\\\" he broke out, a great hopeless\\nHOW ON EARTH CAN I KEEP YOU?  crying out to her beneath his words.\\n\\nShe sat motionless, with lowered lids.  \\\"Oh--I shan't go yet!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not yet?  Some time, then?  Some time that you already foresee?\\\"\\n\\nAt that she raised her clearest eyes.  \\\"I promise you: not as long as\\nyou hold out.  Not as long as we can look straight at each other like\\nthis.\\\"\\n\\nHe dropped into his chair.  What her answer really said was:  \\\"If you\\nlift a finger you'll drive me back: back to all the abominations you\\nknow of, and all the temptations you half guess.\\\"  He understood it as\\nclearly as if she had uttered the words, and the thought kept him\\nanchored to his side of the table in a kind of moved and sacred\\nsubmission.\\n\\n\\\"What a life for you!--\\\" he groaned.\\n\\n\\\"Oh--as long as it's a part of yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And mine a part of yours?\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\\\"And that's to be all--for either of us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well; it IS all, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\nAt that he sprang up, forgetting everything but the sweetness of her\\nface.  She rose too, not as if to meet him or to flee from him, but\\nquietly, as though the worst of the task were done and she had only to\\nwait; so quietly that, as he came close, her outstretched hands acted\\nnot as a check but as a guide to him.  They fell into his, while her\\narms, extended but not rigid, kept him far enough off to let her\\nsurrendered face say the rest.\\n\\nThey may have stood in that way for a long time, or only for a few\\nmoments; but it was long enough for her silence to communicate all she\\nhad to say, and for him to feel that only one thing mattered.  He must\\ndo nothing to make this meeting their last; he must leave their future\\nin her care, asking only that she should keep fast hold of it.\\n\\n\\\"Don't--don't be unhappy,\\\" she said, with a break in her voice, as she\\ndrew her hands away; and he answered:  \\\"You won't go back--you won't go\\nback?\\\" as if it were the one possibility he could not bear.\\n\\n\\\"I won't go back,\\\" she said; and turning away she opened the door and\\nled the way into the public dining-room.\\n\\nThe strident school-teachers were gathering up their possessions\\npreparatory to a straggling flight to the wharf; across the beach lay\\nthe white steam-boat at the pier; and over the sunlit waters Boston\\nloomed in a line of haze.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more on the boat, and in the presence of others, Archer felt a\\ntranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him.\\n\\nThe day, according to any current valuation, had been a rather\\nridiculous failure; he had not so much as touched Madame Olenska's hand\\nwith his lips, or extracted one word from her that gave promise of\\nfarther opportunities.  Nevertheless, for a man sick with unsatisfied\\nlove, and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his\\npassion, he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted.  It\\nwas the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others\\nand their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet\\ntranquillized him; a balance not artfully calculated, as her tears and\\nher falterings showed, but resulting naturally from her unabashed\\nsincerity.  It filled him with a tender awe, now the danger was over,\\nand made him thank the fates that no personal vanity, no sense of\\nplaying a part before sophisticated witnesses, had tempted him to tempt\\nher.  Even after they had clasped hands for good-bye at the Fall River\\nstation, and he had turned away alone, the conviction remained with him\\nof having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed.\\n\\nHe wandered back to the club, and went and sat alone in the deserted\\nlibrary, turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second\\nof their hours together.  It was clear to him, and it grew more clear\\nunder closer scrutiny, that if she should finally decide on returning\\nto Europe--returning to her husband--it would not be because her old\\nlife tempted her, even on the new terms offered.  No: she would go only\\nif she felt herself becoming a temptation to Archer, a temptation to\\nfall away from the standard they had both set up.  Her choice would be\\nto stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer; and it\\ndepended on himself to keep her just there, safe but secluded.\\n\\nIn the train these thoughts were still with him.  They enclosed him in\\na kind of golden haze, through which the faces about him looked remote\\nand indistinct: he had a feeling that if he spoke to his\\nfellow-travellers they would not understand what he was saying.  In\\nthis state of abstraction he found himself, the following morning,\\nwaking to the reality of a stifling September day in New York.  The\\nheat-withered faces in the long train streamed past him, and he\\ncontinued to stare at them through the same golden blur; but suddenly,\\nas he left the station, one of the faces detached itself, came closer\\nand forced itself upon his consciousness.  It was, as he instantly\\nrecalled, the face of the young man he had seen, the day before,\\npassing out of the Parker House, and had noted as not conforming to\\ntype, as not having an American hotel face.\\n\\nThe same thing struck him now; and again he became aware of a dim stir\\nof former associations.  The young man stood looking about him with the\\ndazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of American\\ntravel; then he advanced toward Archer, lifted his hat, and said in\\nEnglish:  \\\"Surely, Monsieur, we met in London?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, to be sure: in London!\\\"  Archer grasped his hand with curiosity\\nand sympathy.  \\\"So you DID get here, after all?\\\" he exclaimed, casting\\na wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young\\nCarfry's French tutor.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I got here--yes,\\\" M. Riviere smiled with drawn lips.  \\\"But not for\\nlong; I return the day after tomorrow.\\\" He stood grasping his light\\nvalise in one neatly gloved hand, and gazing anxiously, perplexedly,\\nalmost appealingly, into Archer's face.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder, Monsieur, since I've had the good luck to run across you, if\\nI might--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was just going to suggest it: come to luncheon, won't you?  Down\\ntown, I mean: if you'll look me up in my office I'll take you to a very\\ndecent restaurant in that quarter.\\\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere was visibly touched and surprised.  \\\"You're too kind.  But I\\nwas only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of\\nconveyance.  There are no porters, and no one here seems to listen--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know: our American stations must surprise you.  When you ask for a\\nporter they give you chewing-gum.  But if you'll come along I'll\\nextricate you; and you must really lunch with me, you know.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man, after a just perceptible hesitation, replied, with\\nprofuse thanks, and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction,\\nthat he was already engaged; but when they had reached the comparative\\nreassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon.\\n\\nArcher, at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office, fixed an hour\\nand scribbled his address, which the Frenchman pocketed with reiterated\\nthanks and a wide flourish of his hat.  A horse-car received him, and\\nArcher walked away.\\n\\nPunctually at the hour M. Riviere appeared, shaved, smoothed-out, but\\nstill unmistakably drawn and serious.  Archer was alone in his office,\\nand the young man, before accepting the seat he proffered, began\\nabruptly: \\\"I believe I saw you, sir, yesterday in Boston.\\\"\\n\\nThe statement was insignificant enough, and Archer was about to frame\\nan assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet\\nilluminating in his visitor's insistent gaze.\\n\\n\\\"It is extraordinary, very extraordinary,\\\" M. Riviere continued, \\\"that\\nwe should have met in the circumstances in which I find myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What circumstances?\\\" Archer asked, wondering a little crudely if he\\nneeded money.\\n\\nM. Riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes.  \\\"I have come,\\nnot to look for employment, as I spoke of doing when we last met, but\\non a special mission--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--!\\\" Archer exclaimed.  In a flash the two meetings had connected\\nthemselves in his mind.  He paused to take in the situation thus\\nsuddenly lighted up for him, and M. Riviere also remained silent, as if\\naware that what he had said was enough.\\n\\n\\\"A special mission,\\\" Archer at length repeated.\\n\\nThe young Frenchman, opening his palms, raised them slightly, and the\\ntwo men continued to look at each other across the office-desk till\\nArcher roused himself to say:  \\\"Do sit down\\\"; whereupon M. Riviere\\nbowed, took a distant chair, and again waited.\\n\\n\\\"It was about this mission that you wanted to consult me?\\\" Archer\\nfinally asked.\\n\\nM. Riviere bent his head.  \\\"Not in my own behalf: on that score I--I\\nhave fully dealt with myself.  I should like--if I may--to speak to you\\nabout the Countess Olenska.\\\"\\n\\nArcher had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming;\\nbut when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he\\nhad been caught by a bent-back branch in a thicket.\\n\\n\\\"And on whose behalf,\\\" he said, \\\"do you wish to do this?\\\"\\n\\nM. Riviere met the question sturdily.  \\\"Well--I might say HERS, if it\\ndid not sound like a liberty.  Shall I say instead: on behalf of\\nabstract justice?\\\"\\n\\nArcher considered him ironically.  \\\"In other words: you are Count\\nOlenski's messenger?\\\"\\n\\nHe saw his blush more darkly reflected in M. Riviere's sallow\\ncountenance.  \\\"Not to YOU, Monsieur.  If I come to you, it is on quite\\nother grounds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What right have you, in the circumstances, to BE on any other ground?\\\"\\nArcher retorted.  \\\"If you're an emissary you're an emissary.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man considered.  \\\"My mission is over: as far as the Countess\\nOlenska goes, it has failed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't help that,\\\" Archer rejoined on the same note of irony.\\n\\n\\\"No: but you can help--\\\"  M. Riviere paused, turned his hat about in\\nhis still carefully gloved hands, looked into its lining and then back\\nat Archer's face.  \\\"You can help, Monsieur, I am convinced, to make it\\nequally a failure with her family.\\\"\\n\\nArcher pushed back his chair and stood up.  \\\"Well--and by God I will!\\\"\\nhe exclaimed.  He stood with his hands in his pockets, staring down\\nwrathfully at the little Frenchman, whose face, though he too had\\nrisen, was still an inch or two below the line of Archer's eyes.\\n\\nM. Riviere paled to his normal hue: paler than that his complexion\\ncould hardly turn.\\n\\n\\\"Why the devil,\\\" Archer explosively continued, \\\"should you have\\nthought--since I suppose you're appealing to me on the ground of my\\nrelationship to Madame Olenska--that I should take a view contrary to\\nthe rest of her family?\\\"\\n\\nThe change of expression in M. Riviere's face was for a time his only\\nanswer.  His look passed from timidity to absolute distress: for a\\nyoung man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult\\nto appear more disarmed and defenceless.  \\\"Oh, Monsieur--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't imagine,\\\" Archer continued, \\\"why you should have come to me\\nwhen there are others so much nearer to the Countess; still less why\\nyou thought I should be more accessible to the arguments I suppose you\\nwere sent over with.\\\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility.  \\\"The\\narguments I want to present to you, Monsieur, are my own and not those\\nI was sent over with.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I see still less reason for listening to them.\\\"\\n\\nM. Riviere again looked into his hat, as if considering whether these\\nlast words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone.\\nThen he spoke with sudden decision.  \\\"Monsieur--will you tell me one\\nthing?  Is it my right to be here that you question?  Or do you perhaps\\nbelieve the whole matter to be already closed?\\\"\\n\\nHis quiet insistence made Archer feel the clumsiness of his own\\nbluster.  M. Riviere had succeeded in imposing himself:  Archer,\\nreddening slightly, dropped into his chair again, and signed to the\\nyoung man to be seated.\\n\\n\\\"I beg your pardon: but why isn't the matter closed?\\\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere gazed back at him with anguish.  \\\"You do, then, agree with\\nthe rest of the family that, in face of the new proposals I have\\nbrought, it is hardly possible for Madame Olenska not to return to her\\nhusband?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good God!\\\" Archer exclaimed; and his visitor gave out a low murmur of\\nconfirmation.\\n\\n\\\"Before seeing her, I saw--at Count Olenski's request--Mr. Lovell\\nMingott, with whom I had several talks before going to Boston.  I\\nunderstand that he represents his mother's view; and that Mrs. Manson\\nMingott's influence is great throughout her family.\\\"\\n\\nArcher sat silent, with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding\\nprecipice.  The discovery that he had been excluded from a share in\\nthese negotiations, and even from the knowledge that they were on foot,\\ncaused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was\\nlearning.  He saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult\\nhim it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no\\nlonger on their side; and he recalled, with a start of comprehension, a\\nremark of May's during their drive home from Mrs. Manson Mingott's on\\nthe day of the Archery Meeting:  \\\"Perhaps, after all, Ellen would be\\nhappier with her husband.\\\"\\n\\nEven in the tumult of new discoveries Archer remembered his indignant\\nexclamation, and the fact that since then his wife had never named\\nMadame Olenska to him.  Her careless allusion had no doubt been the\\nstraw held up to see which way the wind blew; the result had been\\nreported to the family, and thereafter Archer had been tacitly omitted\\nfrom their counsels.  He admired the tribal discipline which made May\\nbow to this decision.  She would not have done so, he knew, had her\\nconscience protested; but she probably shared the family view that\\nMadame Olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a\\nseparated one, and that there was no use in discussing the case with\\nNewland, who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the\\nmost fundamental things for granted.\\n\\nArcher looked up and met his visitor's anxious gaze.  \\\"Don't you know,\\nMonsieur--is it possible you don't know--that the family begin to doubt\\nif they have the right to advise the Countess to refuse her husband's\\nlast proposals?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The proposals you brought?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The proposals I brought.\\\"\\n\\nIt was on Archer's lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not\\nknow was no concern of M. Riviere's; but something in the humble and\\nyet courageous tenacity of M. Riviere's gaze made him reject this\\nconclusion, and he met the young man's question with another.  \\\"What is\\nyour object in speaking to me of this?\\\"\\n\\nHe had not to wait a moment for the answer.  \\\"To beg you, Monsieur--to\\nbeg you with all the force I'm capable of--not to let her go back.--Oh,\\ndon't let her!\\\" M. Riviere exclaimed.\\n\\nArcher looked at him with increasing astonishment.  There was no\\nmistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his\\ndetermination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the\\nboard but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record.  Archer\\nconsidered.\\n\\n\\\"May I ask,\\\" he said at length, \\\"if this is the line you took with the\\nCountess Olenska?\\\"\\n\\n\\nM. Riviere reddened, but his eyes did not falter.  \\\"No, Monsieur: I\\naccepted my mission in good faith.  I really believed--for reasons I\\nneed not trouble you with--that it would be better for Madame Olenska\\nto recover her situation, her fortune, the social consideration that\\nher husband's standing gives her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So I supposed: you could hardly have accepted such a mission\\notherwise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should not have accepted it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then--?\\\"  Archer paused again, and their eyes met in another\\nprotracted scrutiny.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Monsieur, after I had seen her, after I had listened to her, I\\nknew she was better off here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You knew--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur, I discharged my mission faithfully: I put the Count's\\narguments, I stated his offers, without adding any comment of my own.\\nThe Countess was good enough to listen patiently; she carried her\\ngoodness so far as to see me twice; she considered impartially all I\\nhad come to say.  And it was in the course of these two talks that I\\nchanged my mind, that I came to see things differently.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May I ask what led to this change?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Simply seeing the change in HER,\\\" M. Riviere replied.\\n\\n\\\"The change in her?  Then you knew her before?\\\"\\n\\nThe young man's colour again rose.  \\\"I used to see her in her husband's\\nhouse.  I have known Count Olenski for many years.  You can imagine\\nthat he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission.\\\"\\n\\nArcher's gaze, wandering away to the blank walls of the office, rested\\non a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the\\nPresident of the United States.  That such a conversation should be\\ngoing on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his\\nrule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent.\\n\\n\\\"The change--what sort of a change?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Monsieur, if I could tell you!\\\"  M. Riviere paused.  \\\"Tenez--the\\ndiscovery, I suppose, of what I'd never thought of before: that she's\\nan American.  And that if you're an American of HER kind--of your\\nkind--things that are accepted in certain other societies, or at least\\nput up with as part of a general convenient give-and-take--become\\nunthinkable, simply unthinkable.  If Madame Olenska's relations\\nunderstood what these things were, their opposition to her returning\\nwould no doubt be as unconditional as her own; but they seem to regard\\nher husband's wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing\\nfor domestic life.\\\"  M. Riviere paused, and then added:  \\\"Whereas it's\\nfar from being as simple as that.\\\"\\n\\nArcher looked back to the President of the United States, and then down\\nat his desk and at the papers scattered on it.  For a second or two he\\ncould not trust himself to speak.  During this interval he heard M.\\nRiviere's chair pushed back, and was aware that the young man had\\nrisen.  When he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved\\nas himself.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" Archer said simply.\\n\\n\\\"There's nothing to thank me for, Monsieur: it is I, rather--\\\"  M.\\nRiviere broke off, as if speech for him too were difficult.  \\\"I should\\nlike, though,\\\" he continued in a firmer voice, \\\"to add one thing.  You\\nasked me if I was in Count Olenski's employ.  I am at this moment: I\\nreturned to him, a few months ago, for reasons of private necessity\\nsuch as may happen to any one who has persons, ill and older persons,\\ndependent on him.  But from the moment that I have taken the step of\\ncoming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged,\\nand I shall tell him so on my return, and give him the reasons.  That's\\nall, Monsieur.\\\"\\n\\nM. Riviere bowed and drew back a step.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" Archer said again, as their hands met.\\n\\n\\nEvery year on the fifteenth of October Fifth Avenue opened its\\nshutters, unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of\\nwindow-curtains.\\n\\nBy the first of November this household ritual was over, and society\\nhad begun to look about and take stock of itself.  By the fifteenth the\\nseason was in full blast, Opera and theatres were putting forth their\\nnew attractions, dinner-engagements were accumulating, and dates for\\ndances being fixed.  And punctually at about this time Mrs. Archer\\nalways said that New York was very much changed.\\n\\nObserving it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was\\nable, with the help of Mr. Sillerton Jackson and Miss Sophy, to trace\\neach new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up\\nbetween the ordered rows of social vegetables.  It had been one of the\\namusements of Archer's youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of\\nhis mother's, and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of\\ndisintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked.  For New York, to\\nMrs. Archer's mind, never changed without changing for the worse; and\\nin this view Miss Sophy Jackson heartily concurred.\\n\\nMr. Sillerton Jackson, as became a man of the world, suspended his\\njudgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations\\nof the ladies.  But even he never denied that New York had changed; and\\nNewland Archer, in the winter of the second year of his marriage, was\\nhimself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was\\ncertainly changing.\\n\\nThese points had been raised, as usual, at Mrs. Archer's Thanksgiving\\ndinner.  At the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks\\nfor the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful\\nthough not embittered stock of her world, and wonder what there was to\\nbe thankful for.  At any rate, not the state of society; society, if it\\ncould be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down\\nBiblical imprecations--and in fact, every one knew what the Reverend\\nDr. Ashmore meant when he chose a text from Jeremiah (chap. ii., verse\\n25) for his Thanksgiving sermon.  Dr. Ashmore, the new Rector of St.\\nMatthew's, had been chosen because he was very \\\"advanced\\\": his sermons\\nwere considered bold in thought and novel in language.  When he\\nfulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its \\\"trend\\\";\\nand to Mrs. Archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel\\nherself part of a community that was trending.\\n\\n\\\"There's no doubt that Dr. Ashmore is right: there IS a marked trend,\\\"\\nshe said, as if it were something visible and measurable, like a crack\\nin a house.\\n\\n\\\"It was odd, though, to preach about it on Thanksgiving,\\\" Miss Jackson\\nopined; and her hostess drily rejoined:  \\\"Oh, he means us to give\\nthanks for what's left.\\\"\\n\\nArcher had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his\\nmother's; but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge, as he\\nlistened to an enumeration of the changes, that the \\\"trend\\\" was visible.\\n\\n\\\"The extravagance in dress--\\\" Miss Jackson began.  \\\"Sillerton took me\\nto the first night of the Opera, and I can only tell you that Jane\\nMerry's dress was the only one I recognised from last year; and even\\nthat had had the front panel changed.  Yet I know she got it out from\\nWorth only two years ago, because my seamstress always goes in to make\\nover her Paris dresses before she wears them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Jane Merry is one of US,\\\" said Mrs. Archer sighing, as if it were\\nnot such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning\\nto flaunt abroad their Paris dresses as soon as they were out of the\\nCustom House, instead of letting them mellow under lock and key, in the\\nmanner of Mrs. Archer's contemporaries.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; she's one of the few.  In my youth,\\\" Miss Jackson rejoined, \\\"it\\nwas considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions; and Amy\\nSillerton has always told me that in Boston the rule was to put away\\none's Paris dresses for two years.  Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow, who did\\neverything handsomely, used to import twelve a year, two velvet, two\\nsatin, two silk, and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere.\\nIt was a standing order, and as she was ill for two years before she\\ndied they found forty-eight Worth dresses that had never been taken out\\nof tissue paper; and when the girls left off their mourning they were\\nable to wear the first lot at the Symphony concerts without looking in\\nadvance of the fashion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well, Boston is more conservative than New York; but I always\\nthink it's a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for\\none season,\\\" Mrs. Archer conceded.\\n\\n\\\"It was Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap\\nher new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived: I must say at\\ntimes it takes all Regina's distinction not to look like ... like ...\\\"\\nMiss Jackson glanced around the table, caught Janey's bulging gaze, and\\ntook refuge in an unintelligible murmur.\\n\\n\\\"Like her rivals,\\\" said Mr. Sillerton Jackson, with the air of\\nproducing an epigram.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,--\\\" the ladies murmured; and Mrs. Archer added, partly to distract\\nher daughter's attention from forbidden topics:  \\\"Poor Regina!  Her\\nThanksgiving hasn't been a very cheerful one, I'm afraid.  Have you\\nheard the rumours about Beaufort's speculations, Sillerton?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson nodded carelessly.  Every one had heard the rumours in\\nquestion, and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common\\nproperty.\\n\\nA gloomy silence fell upon the party.  No one really liked Beaufort,\\nand it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private\\nlife; but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his\\nwife's family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies.\\nArcher's New York tolerated hypocrisy in private relations; but in\\nbusiness matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty.  It was a\\nlong time since any well-known banker had failed discreditably; but\\nevery one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the\\nfirm when the last event of the kind had happened.  It would be the\\nsame with the Beauforts, in spite of his power and her popularity; not\\nall the leagued strength of the Dallas connection would save poor\\nRegina if there were any truth in the reports of her husband's unlawful\\nspeculations.\\n\\nThe talk took refuge in less ominous topics; but everything they\\ntouched on seemed to confirm Mrs. Archer's sense of an accelerated\\ntrend.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Newland, I know you let dear May go to Mrs. Struthers's\\nSunday evenings--\\\" she began; and May interposed gaily:  \\\"Oh, you know,\\neverybody goes to Mrs. Struthers's now; and she was invited to Granny's\\nlast reception.\\\"\\n\\nIt was thus, Archer reflected, that New York managed its transitions:\\nconspiring to ignore them till they were well over, and then, in all\\ngood faith, imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age.\\nThere was always a traitor in the citadel; and after he (or generally\\nshe) had surrendered the keys, what was the use of pretending that it\\nwas impregnable?  Once people had tasted of Mrs. Struthers's easy\\nSunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that\\nher champagne was transmuted Shoe-Polish.\\n\\n\\\"I know, dear, I know,\\\" Mrs. Archer sighed.  \\\"Such things have to be, I\\nsuppose, as long as AMUSEMENT is what people go out for; but I've never\\nquite forgiven your cousin Madame Olenska for being the first person to\\ncountenance Mrs. Struthers.\\\"\\n\\nA sudden blush rose to young Mrs. Archer's face; it surprised her\\nhusband as much as the other guests about the table.  \\\"Oh, ELLEN--\\\" she\\nmurmured, much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which\\nher parents might have said:  \\\"Oh, THE BLENKERS--.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention\\nof the Countess Olenska's name, since she had surprised and\\ninconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husband's advances;\\nbut on May's lips it gave food for thought, and Archer looked at her\\nwith the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was\\nmost in the tone of her environment.\\n\\nHis mother, with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere, still\\ninsisted:  \\\"I've always thought that people like the Countess Olenska,\\nwho have lived in aristocratic societies, ought to help us to keep up\\nour social distinctions, instead of ignoring them.\\\"\\n\\nMay's blush remained permanently vivid: it seemed to have a\\nsignificance beyond that implied by the recognition of Madame Olenska's\\nsocial bad faith.\\n\\n\\\"I've no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners,\\\" said Miss Jackson\\ntartly.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think Ellen cares for society; but nobody knows exactly what\\nshe does care for,\\\" May continued, as if she had been groping for\\nsomething noncommittal.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well--\\\" Mrs. Archer sighed again.\\n\\nEverybody knew that the Countess Olenska was no longer in the good\\ngraces of her family.  Even her devoted champion, old Mrs. Manson\\nMingott, had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her\\nhusband.  The Mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud:\\ntheir sense of solidarity was too strong.  They had simply, as Mrs.\\nWelland said, \\\"let poor Ellen find her own level\\\"--and that,\\nmortifyingly and incomprehensibly, was in the dim depths where the\\nBlenkers prevailed, and \\\"people who wrote\\\" celebrated their untidy\\nrites.  It was incredible, but it was a fact, that Ellen, in spite of\\nall her opportunities and her privileges, had become simply \\\"Bohemian.\\\"\\nThe fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in\\nnot returning to Count Olenski.  After all, a young woman's place was\\nunder her husband's roof, especially when she had left it in\\ncircumstances that ... well ... if one had cared to look into them ...\\n\\n\\\"Madame Olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen,\\\" said Miss\\nSophy, with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when\\nshe knew that she was planting a dart.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, that's the danger that a young woman like Madame Olenska is always\\nexposed to,\\\" Mrs. Archer mournfully agreed; and the ladies, on this\\nconclusion, gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the\\ndrawing-room, while Archer and Mr. Sillerton Jackson withdrew to the\\nGothic library.\\n\\nOnce established before the grate, and consoling himself for the\\ninadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar, Mr. Jackson\\nbecame portentous and communicable.\\n\\n\\\"If the Beaufort smash comes,\\\" he announced, \\\"there are going to be\\ndisclosures.\\\"\\n\\nArcher raised his head quickly: he could never hear the name without\\nthe sharp vision of Beaufort's heavy figure, opulently furred and shod,\\nadvancing through the snow at Skuytercliff.\\n\\n\\\"There's bound to be,\\\" Mr. Jackson continued, \\\"the nastiest kind of a\\ncleaning up.  He hasn't spent all his money on Regina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well--that's discounted, isn't it?  My belief is he'll pull out\\nyet,\\\" said the young man, wanting to change the subject.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps--perhaps.  I know he was to see some of the influential people\\ntoday.  Of course,\\\" Mr. Jackson reluctantly conceded, \\\"it's to be hoped\\nthey can tide him over--this time anyhow.  I shouldn't like to think of\\npoor Regina's spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign\\nwatering-place for bankrupts.\\\"\\n\\nArcher said nothing.  It seemed to him so natural--however tragic--that\\nmoney ill-gotten should be cruelly expiated, that his mind, hardly\\nlingering over Mrs. Beaufort's doom, wandered back to closer questions.\\nWhat was the meaning of May's blush when the Countess Olenska had been\\nmentioned?\\n\\nFour months had passed since the midsummer day that he and Madame\\nOlenska had spent together; and since then he had not seen her.  He\\nknew that she had returned to Washington, to the little house which she\\nand Medora Manson had taken there: he had written to her once--a few\\nwords, asking when they were to meet again--and she had even more\\nbriefly replied: \\\"Not yet.\\\"\\n\\nSince then there had been no farther communication between them, and he\\nhad built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned\\namong his secret thoughts and longings.  Little by little it became the\\nscene of his real life, of his only rational activities; thither he\\nbrought the books he read, the ideas and feelings which nourished him,\\nhis judgments and his visions.  Outside it, in the scene of his actual\\nlife, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency,\\nblundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view\\nas an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own\\nroom.  Absent--that was what he was: so absent from everything most\\ndensely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him\\nto find they still imagined he was there.\\n\\nHe became aware that Mr. Jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to\\nfarther revelations.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know, of course, how far your wife's family are aware of what\\npeople say about--well, about Madame Olenska's refusal to accept her\\nhusband's latest offer.\\\"\\n\\nArcher was silent, and Mr. Jackson obliquely continued: \\\"It's a\\npity--it's certainly a pity--that she refused it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A pity?  In God's name, why?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it\\nto a glossy pump.\\n\\n\\\"Well--to put it on the lowest ground--what's she going to live on now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If Beaufort--\\\"\\n\\nArcher sprang up, his fist banging down on the black walnut-edge of the\\nwriting-table.  The wells of the brass double-inkstand danced in their\\nsockets.\\n\\n\\\"What the devil do you mean, sir?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Jackson, shifting himself slightly in his chair, turned a tranquil\\ngaze on the young man's burning face.\\n\\n\\\"Well--I have it on pretty good authority--in fact, on old Catherine's\\nherself--that the family reduced Countess Olenska's allowance\\nconsiderably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband; and\\nas, by this refusal, she also forfeits the money settled on her when\\nshe married--which Olenski was ready to make over to her if she\\nreturned--why, what the devil do YOU mean, my dear boy, by asking me\\nwhat I mean?\\\" Mr. Jackson good-humouredly retorted.\\n\\nArcher moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes\\ninto the grate.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know anything of Madame Olenska's private affairs; but I don't\\nneed to, to be certain that what you insinuate--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't: it's Lefferts, for one,\\\" Mr. Jackson interposed.\\n\\n\\\"Lefferts--who made love to her and got snubbed for it!\\\" Archer broke\\nout contemptuously.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--DID he?\\\" snapped the other, as if this were exactly the fact he\\nhad been laying a trap for.  He still sat sideways from the fire, so\\nthat his hard old gaze held Archer's face as if in a spring of steel.\\n\\n\\\"Well, well: it's a pity she didn't go back before Beaufort's cropper,\\\"\\nhe repeated.  \\\"If she goes NOW, and if he fails, it will only confirm\\nthe general impression: which isn't by any means peculiar to Lefferts,\\nby the way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, she won't go back now: less than ever!\\\"  Archer had no sooner said\\nit than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what Mr.\\nJackson had been waiting for.\\n\\nThe old gentleman considered him attentively.  \\\"That's your opinion,\\neh?  Well, no doubt you know.  But everybody will tell you that the few\\npennies Medora Manson has left are all in Beaufort's hands; and how the\\ntwo women are to keep their heads above water unless he does, I can't\\nimagine.  Of course, Madame Olenska may still soften old Catherine,\\nwho's been the most inexorably opposed to her staying; and old\\nCatherine could make her any allowance she chooses.  But we all know\\nthat she hates parting with good money; and the rest of the family have\\nno particular interest in keeping Madame Olenska here.\\\"\\n\\nArcher was burning with unavailing wrath: he was exactly in the state\\nwhen a man is sure to do something stupid, knowing all the while that\\nhe is doing it.\\n\\nHe saw that Mr. Jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that\\nMadame Olenska's differences with her grandmother and her other\\nrelations were not known to him, and that the old gentleman had drawn\\nhis own conclusions as to the reasons for Archer's exclusion from the\\nfamily councils.  This fact warned Archer to go warily; but the\\ninsinuations about Beaufort made him reckless.  He was mindful,\\nhowever, if not of his own danger, at least of the fact that Mr.\\nJackson was under his mother's roof, and consequently his guest.  Old\\nNew York scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality, and no\\ndiscussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a\\ndisagreement.\\n\\n\\\"Shall we go up and join my mother?\\\" he suggested curtly, as Mr.\\nJackson's last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his\\nelbow.\\n\\nOn the drive homeward May remained oddly silent; through the darkness,\\nhe still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush.  What its menace\\nmeant he could not guess: but he was sufficiently warned by the fact\\nthat Madame Olenska's name had evoked it.\\n\\nThey went upstairs, and he turned into the library.  She usually\\nfollowed him; but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom.\\n\\n\\\"May!\\\" he called out impatiently; and she came back, with a slight\\nglance of surprise at his tone.\\n\\n\\\"This lamp is smoking again; I should think the servants might see that\\nit's kept properly trimmed,\\\" he grumbled nervously.\\n\\n\\\"I'm so sorry: it shan't happen again,\\\" she answered, in the firm\\nbright tone she had learned from her mother; and it exasperated Archer\\nto feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger Mr.\\nWelland.  She bent over to lower the wick, and as the light struck up\\non her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought:\\n\\\"How young she is!  For what endless years this life will have to go\\non!\\\"\\n\\nHe felt, with a kind of horror, his own strong youth and the bounding\\nblood in his veins.  \\\"Look here,\\\" he said suddenly, \\\"I may have to go\\nto Washington for a few days--soon; next week perhaps.\\\"\\n\\nHer hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly.\\nThe heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face, but it\\npaled as she looked up.\\n\\n\\\"On business?\\\" she asked, in a tone which implied that there could be\\nno other conceivable reason, and that she had put the question\\nautomatically, as if merely to finish his own sentence.\\n\\n\\\"On business, naturally.  There's a patent case coming up before the\\nSupreme Court--\\\"  He gave the name of the inventor, and went on\\nfurnishing details with all Lawrence Lefferts's practised glibness,\\nwhile she listened attentively, saying at intervals:  \\\"Yes, I see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The change will do you good,\\\" she said simply, when he had finished;\\n\\\"and you must be sure to go and see Ellen,\\\" she added, looking him\\nstraight in the eyes with her cloudless smile, and speaking in the tone\\nshe might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome\\nfamily duty.\\n\\nIt was the only word that passed between them on the subject; but in\\nthe code in which they had both been trained it meant:  \\\"Of course you\\nunderstand that I know all that people have been saying about Ellen,\\nand heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to\\nreturn to her husband.  I also know that, for some reason you have not\\nchosen to tell me, you have advised her against this course, which all\\nthe older men of the family, as well as our grandmother, agree in\\napproving; and that it is owing to your encouragement that Ellen defies\\nus all, and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which Mr.\\nSillerton Jackson probably gave you, this evening, the hint that has\\nmade you so irritable....  Hints have indeed not been wanting; but\\nsince you appear unwilling to take them from others, I offer you this\\none myself, in the only form in which well-bred people of our kind can\\ncommunicate unpleasant things to each other: by letting you understand\\nthat I know you mean to see Ellen when you are in Washington, and are\\nperhaps going there expressly for that purpose; and that, since you are\\nsure to see her, I wish you to do so with my full and explicit\\napproval--and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the\\ncourse of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to.\\\"\\n\\nHer hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this\\nmute message reached him.  She turned the wick down, lifted off the\\nglobe, and breathed on the sulky flame.\\n\\n\\\"They smell less if one blows them out,\\\" she explained, with her bright\\nhousekeeping air.  On the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWall Street, the next day, had more reassuring reports of Beaufort's\\nsituation.  They were not definite, but they were hopeful.  It was\\ngenerally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case\\nof emergency, and that he had done so with success; and that evening,\\nwhen Mrs. Beaufort appeared at the Opera wearing her old smile and a\\nnew emerald necklace, society drew a breath of relief.\\n\\nNew York was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities.\\nSo far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who\\nbroke the law of probity must pay; and every one was aware that even\\nBeaufort and Beaufort's wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this\\nprinciple.  But to be obliged to offer them up would be not only\\npainful but inconvenient.  The disappearance of the Beauforts would\\nleave a considerable void in their compact little circle; and those who\\nwere too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe\\nbewailed in advance the loss of the best ball-room in New York.\\n\\nArcher had definitely made up his mind to go to Washington.  He was\\nwaiting only for the opening of the law-suit of which he had spoken to\\nMay, so that its date might coincide with that of his visit; but on the\\nfollowing Tuesday he learned from Mr. Letterblair that the case might\\nbe postponed for several weeks.  Nevertheless, he went home that\\nafternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening.  The\\nchances were that May, who knew nothing of his professional life, and\\nhad never shown any interest in it, would not learn of the\\npostponement, should it take place, nor remember the names of the\\nlitigants if they were mentioned before her; and at any rate he could\\nno longer put off seeing Madame Olenska.  There were too many things\\nthat he must say to her.\\n\\nOn the Wednesday morning, when he reached his office, Mr. Letterblair\\nmet him with a troubled face.  Beaufort, after all, had not managed to\\n\\\"tide over\\\"; but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he\\nhad reassured his depositors, and heavy payments had poured into the\\nbank till the previous evening, when disturbing reports again began to\\npredominate.  In consequence, a run on the bank had begun, and its\\ndoors were likely to close before the day was over.  The ugliest things\\nwere being said of Beaufort's dastardly manoeuvre, and his failure\\npromised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of Wall\\nStreet.\\n\\nThe extent of the calamity left Mr. Letterblair white and\\nincapacitated.  \\\"I've seen bad things in my time; but nothing as bad as\\nthis.  Everybody we know will be hit, one way or another.  And what\\nwill be done about Mrs. Beaufort?  What CAN be done about her?  I pity\\nMrs. Manson Mingott as much as anybody: coming at her age, there's no\\nknowing what effect this affair may have on her.  She always believed\\nin Beaufort--she made a friend of him!  And there's the whole Dallas\\nconnection: poor Mrs. Beaufort is related to every one of you.  Her\\nonly chance would be to leave her husband--yet how can any one tell her\\nso?  Her duty is at his side; and luckily she seems always to have been\\nblind to his private weaknesses.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a knock, and Mr. Letterblair turned his head sharply.  \\\"What\\nis it?  I can't be disturbed.\\\"\\n\\nA clerk brought in a letter for Archer and withdrew.  Recognising his\\nwife's hand, the young man opened the envelope and read:  \\\"Won't you\\nplease come up town as early as you can?  Granny had a slight stroke\\nlast night.  In some mysterious way she found out before any one else\\nthis awful news about the bank.  Uncle Lovell is away shooting, and the\\nidea of the disgrace has made poor Papa so nervous that he has a\\ntemperature and can't leave his room.  Mamma needs you dreadfully, and\\nI do hope you can get away at once and go straight to Granny's.\\\"\\n\\nArcher handed the note to his senior partner, and a few minutes later\\nwas crawling northward in a crowded horse-car, which he exchanged at\\nFourteenth Street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the Fifth\\nAvenue line.  It was after twelve o'clock when this laborious vehicle\\ndropped him at old Catherine's.  The sitting-room window on the ground\\nfloor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure\\nof her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she\\ncaught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May.  The hall\\nwore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly\\ninvaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a\\ndoctor's bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters\\nand cards had already piled up unheeded.\\n\\nMay looked pale but smiling: Dr. Bencomb, who had just come for the\\nsecond time, took a more hopeful view, and Mrs. Mingott's dauntless\\ndetermination to live and get well was already having an effect on her\\nfamily.  May led Archer into the old lady's sitting-room, where the\\nsliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the\\nheavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them; and here Mrs. Welland\\ncommunicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the\\ncatastrophe.  It appeared that the evening before something dreadful\\nand mysterious had happened.  At about eight o'clock, just after Mrs.\\nMingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after\\ndinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the\\nservants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received.\\n\\nThe butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting-room\\ndoor, announcing:  \\\"Mrs. Julius Beaufort\\\"--and had then closed it again\\non the two ladies.  They must have been together, he thought, about an\\nhour.  When Mrs. Mingott's bell rang Mrs. Beaufort had already slipped\\naway unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone\\nin her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room.\\nShe seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete\\ncontrol of her body and brain.  The mulatto maid put her to bed,\\nbrought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the\\nroom, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again,\\nand the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old\\nCatherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting\\nup against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little\\nhand hanging limp from its huge arm.\\n\\nThe stroke had clearly been a slight one, for she was able to\\narticulate and to make her wishes known; and soon after the doctor's\\nfirst visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles.  But\\nthe alarm had been great; and proportionately great was the indignation\\nwhen it was gathered from Mrs. Mingott's fragmentary phrases that\\nRegina Beaufort had come to ask her--incredible effrontery!--to back up\\nher husband, see them through--not to \\\"desert\\\" them, as she called\\nit--in fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their\\nmonstrous dishonour.\\n\\n\\\"I said to her:  'Honour's always been honour, and honesty honesty, in\\nManson Mingott's house, and will be till I'm carried out of it feet\\nfirst,'\\\" the old woman had stammered into her daughter's ear, in the\\nthick voice of the partly paralysed.  \\\"And when she said:  'But my\\nname, Auntie--my name's Regina Dallas,' I said:  'It was Beaufort when\\nhe covered you with jewels, and it's got to stay Beaufort now that he's\\ncovered you with shame.'\\\"\\n\\nSo much, with tears and gasps of horror, Mrs. Welland imparted,\\nblanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to\\nfix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable.  \\\"If only I could\\nkeep it from your father-in-law: he always says: 'Augusta, for pity's\\nsake, don't destroy my last illusions'--and how am I to prevent his\\nknowing these horrors?\\\" the poor lady wailed.\\n\\n\\\"After all, Mamma, he won't have SEEN them,\\\" her daughter suggested;\\nand Mrs. Welland sighed:  \\\"Ah, no; thank heaven he's safe in bed.  And\\nDr. Bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor Mamma is better,\\nand Regina has been got away somewhere.\\\"\\n\\nArcher had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at\\nthe deserted thoroughfare.  It was evident that he had been summoned\\nrather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any\\nspecific aid that he could render.  Mr. Lovell Mingott had been\\ntelegraphed for, and messages were being despatched by hand to the\\nmembers of the family living in New York; and meanwhile there was\\nnothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of\\nBeaufort's dishonour and of his wife's unjustifiable action.\\n\\nMrs. Lovell Mingott, who had been in another room writing notes,\\npresently reappeared, and added her voice to the discussion.  In THEIR\\nday, the elder ladies agreed, the wife of a man who had done anything\\ndisgraceful in business had only one idea: to efface herself, to\\ndisappear with him.  \\\"There was the case of poor Grandmamma Spicer;\\nyour great-grandmother, May.  Of course,\\\" Mrs. Welland hastened to add,\\n\\\"your great-grandfather's money difficulties were private--losses at\\ncards, or signing a note for somebody--I never quite knew, because\\nMamma would never speak of it.  But she was brought up in the country\\nbecause her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace, whatever\\nit was: they lived up the Hudson alone, winter and summer, till Mamma\\nwas sixteen.  It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask\\nthe family to 'countenance' her, as I understand Regina calls it;\\nthough a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining\\nhundreds of innocent people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it would be more becoming in Regina to hide her own countenance\\nthan to talk about other people's,\\\" Mrs. Lovell Mingott agreed.  \\\"I\\nunderstand that the emerald necklace she wore at the Opera last Friday\\nhad been sent on approval from Ball and Black's in the afternoon.  I\\nwonder if they'll ever get it back?\\\"\\n\\nArcher listened unmoved to the relentless chorus.  The idea of absolute\\nfinancial probity as the first law of a gentleman's code was too deeply\\ningrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it.  An\\nadventurer like Lemuel Struthers might build up the millions of his\\nShoe Polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty\\nwas the noblesse oblige of old financial New York.  Nor did Mrs.\\nBeaufort's fate greatly move Archer.  He felt, no doubt, more sorry for\\nher than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie\\nbetween husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be\\nindissoluble in misfortune.  As Mr. Letterblair had said, a wife's\\nplace was at her husband's side when he was in trouble; but society's\\nplace was not at his side, and Mrs. Beaufort's cool assumption that it\\nwas seemed almost to make her his accomplice.  The mere idea of a\\nwoman's appealing to her family to screen her husband's business\\ndishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the Family,\\nas an institution, could not do.\\n\\nThe mulatto maid called Mrs. Lovell Mingott into the hall, and the\\nlatter came back in a moment with a frowning brow.\\n\\n\\\"She wants me to telegraph for Ellen Olenska.  I had written to Ellen,\\nof course, and to Medora; but now it seems that's not enough.  I'm to\\ntelegraph to her immediately, and to tell her that she's to come alone.\\\"\\n\\nThe announcement was received in silence.  Mrs. Welland sighed\\nresignedly, and May rose from her seat and went to gather up some\\nnewspapers that had been scattered on the floor.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose it must be done,\\\" Mrs. Lovell Mingott continued, as if\\nhoping to be contradicted; and May turned back toward the middle of the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\\"Of course it must be done,\\\" she said.  \\\"Granny knows what she wants,\\nand we must carry out all her wishes.  Shall I write the telegram for\\nyou, Auntie?  If it goes at once Ellen can probably catch tomorrow\\nmorning's train.\\\"  She pronounced the syllables of the name with a\\npeculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells.\\n\\n\\\"Well, it can't go at once.  Jasper and the pantry-boy are both out\\nwith notes and telegrams.\\\"\\n\\nMay turned to her husband with a smile.  \\\"But here's Newland, ready to\\ndo anything.  Will you take the telegram, Newland?  There'll be just\\ntime before luncheon.\\\"\\n\\nArcher rose with a murmur of readiness, and she seated herself at old\\nCatherine's rosewood \\\"Bonheur du Jour,\\\" and wrote out the message in\\nher large immature hand.  When it was written she blotted it neatly and\\nhanded it to Archer.\\n\\n\\\"What a pity,\\\" she said, \\\"that you and Ellen will cross each other on\\nthe way!--Newland,\\\" she added, turning to her mother and aunt, \\\"is\\nobliged to go to Washington about a patent law-suit that is coming up\\nbefore the Supreme Court.  I suppose Uncle Lovell will be back by\\ntomorrow night, and with Granny improving so much it doesn't seem right\\nto ask Newland to give up an important engagement for the firm--does\\nit?\\\"\\n\\nShe paused, as if for an answer, and Mrs. Welland hastily declared:\\n\\\"Oh, of course not, darling.  Your Granny would be the last person to\\nwish it.\\\"  As Archer left the room with the telegram, he heard his\\nmother-in-law add, presumably to Mrs. Lovell Mingott:  \\\"But why on\\nearth she should make you telegraph for Ellen Olenska--\\\" and May's\\nclear voice rejoin:  \\\"Perhaps it's to urge on her again that after all\\nher duty is with her husband.\\\"\\n\\nThe outer door closed on Archer and he walked hastily away toward the\\ntelegraph office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Ol-ol--howjer spell it, anyhow?\\\" asked the tart young lady to whom\\nArcher had pushed his wife's telegram across the brass ledge of the\\nWestern Union office.\\n\\n\\\"Olenska--O-len-ska,\\\" he repeated, drawing back the message in order to\\nprint out the foreign syllables above May's rambling script.\\n\\n\\\"It's an unlikely name for a New York telegraph office; at least in\\nthis quarter,\\\" an unexpected voice observed; and turning around Archer\\nsaw Lawrence Lefferts at his elbow, pulling an imperturbable moustache\\nand affecting not to glance at the message.\\n\\n\\\"Hallo, Newland: thought I'd catch you here.  I've just heard of old\\nMrs. Mingott's stroke; and as I was on my way to the house I saw you\\nturning down this street and nipped after you.  I suppose you've come\\nfrom there?\\\"\\n\\nArcher nodded, and pushed his telegram under the lattice.\\n\\n\\\"Very bad, eh?\\\" Lefferts continued.  \\\"Wiring to the family, I suppose.\\nI gather it IS bad, if you're including Countess Olenska.\\\"\\n\\nArcher's lips stiffened; he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into\\nthe long vain handsome face at his side.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" he questioned.\\n\\nLefferts, who was known to shrink from discussion, raised his eye-brows\\nwith an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel\\nbehind the lattice.  Nothing could be worse \\\"form\\\" the look reminded\\nArcher, than any display of temper in a public place.\\n\\nArcher had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form; but\\nhis impulse to do Lawrence Lefferts a physical injury was only\\nmomentary.  The idea of bandying Ellen Olenska's name with him at such\\na time, and on whatsoever provocation, was unthinkable.  He paid for\\nhis telegram, and the two young men went out together into the street.\\nThere Archer, having regained his self-control, went on:  \\\"Mrs. Mingott\\nis much better: the doctor feels no anxiety whatever\\\"; and Lefferts,\\nwith profuse expressions of relief, asked him if he had heard that\\nthere were beastly bad rumours again about Beaufort....\\n\\nThat afternoon the announcement of the Beaufort failure was in all the\\npapers.  It overshadowed the report of Mrs. Manson Mingott's stroke,\\nand only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the\\ntwo events thought of ascribing old Catherine's illness to anything but\\nthe accumulation of flesh and years.\\n\\nThe whole of New York was darkened by the tale of Beaufort's dishonour.\\nThere had never, as Mr. Letterblair said, been a worse case in his\\nmemory, nor, for that matter, in the memory of the far-off Letterblair\\nwho had given his name to the firm.  The bank had continued to take in\\nmoney for a whole day after its failure was inevitable; and as many of\\nits clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans, Beaufort's\\nduplicity seemed doubly cynical.  If Mrs. Beaufort had not taken the\\ntone that such misfortunes (the word was her own) were \\\"the test of\\nfriendship,\\\" compassion for her might have tempered the general\\nindignation against her husband.  As it was--and especially after the\\nobject of her nocturnal visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott had become\\nknown--her cynicism was held to exceed his; and she had not the\\nexcuse--nor her detractors the satisfaction--of pleading that she was\\n\\\"a foreigner.\\\"  It was some comfort (to those whose securities were not\\nin jeopardy) to be able to remind themselves that Beaufort WAS; but,\\nafter all, if a Dallas of South Carolina took his view of the case, and\\nglibly talked of his soon being \\\"on his feet again,\\\" the argument lost\\nits edge, and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence\\nof the indissolubility of marriage.  Society must manage to get on\\nwithout the Beauforts, and there was an end of it--except indeed for\\nsuch hapless victims of the disaster as Medora Manson, the poor old\\nMiss Lannings, and certain other misguided ladies of good family who,\\nif only they had listened to Mr. Henry van der Luyden ...\\n\\n\\\"The best thing the Beauforts can do,\\\" said Mrs. Archer, summing it up\\nas if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of\\ntreatment, \\\"is to go and live at Regina's little place in North\\nCarolina.  Beaufort has always kept a racing stable, and he had better\\nbreed trotting horses.  I should say he had all the qualities of a\\nsuccessful horsedealer.\\\"  Every one agreed with her, but no one\\ncondescended to enquire what the Beauforts really meant to do.\\n\\nThe next day Mrs. Manson Mingott was much better: she recovered her\\nvoice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the\\nBeauforts to her again, and asked--when Dr. Bencomb appeared--what in\\nthe world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health.\\n\\n\\\"If people of my age WILL eat chicken-salad in the evening what are\\nthey to expect?\\\" she enquired; and, the doctor having opportunely\\nmodified her dietary, the stroke was transformed into an attack of\\nindigestion.  But in spite of her firm tone old Catherine did not\\nwholly recover her former attitude toward life.  The growing remoteness\\nof old age, though it had not diminished her curiosity about her\\nneighbours, had blunted her never very lively compassion for their\\ntroubles; and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the Beaufort\\ndisaster out of her mind.  But for the first time she became absorbed\\nin her own symptoms, and began to take a sentimental interest in\\ncertain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been\\ncontemptuously indifferent.\\n\\nMr. Welland, in particular, had the privilege of attracting her notice.\\nOf her sons-in-law he was the one she had most consistently ignored;\\nand all his wife's efforts to represent him as a man of forceful\\ncharacter and marked intellectual ability (if he had only \\\"chosen\\\") had\\nbeen met with a derisive chuckle.  But his eminence as a valetudinarian\\nnow made him an object of engrossing interest, and Mrs. Mingott issued\\nan imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his\\ntemperature permitted; for old Catherine was now the first to recognise\\nthat one could not be too careful about temperatures.\\n\\nTwenty-four hours after Madame Olenska's summons a telegram announced\\nthat she would arrive from Washington on the evening of the following\\nday.  At the Wellands', where the Newland Archers chanced to be\\nlunching, the question as to who should meet her at Jersey City was\\nimmediately raised; and the material difficulties amid which the\\nWelland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost, lent\\nanimation to the debate.  It was agreed that Mrs. Welland could not\\npossibly go to Jersey City because she was to accompany her husband to\\nold Catherine's that afternoon, and the brougham could not be spared,\\nsince, if Mr. Welland were \\\"upset\\\" by seeing his mother-in-law for the\\nfirst time after her attack, he might have to be taken home at a\\nmoment's notice.  The Welland sons would of course be \\\"down town,\\\" Mr.\\nLovell Mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting, and the\\nMingott carriage engaged in meeting him; and one could not ask May, at\\nthe close of a winter afternoon, to go alone across the ferry to Jersey\\nCity, even in her own carriage.  Nevertheless, it might appear\\ninhospitable--and contrary to old Catherine's express wishes--if Madame\\nOlenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the\\nstation to receive her.  It was just like Ellen, Mrs. Welland's tired\\nvoice implied, to place the family in such a dilemma.  \\\"It's always one\\nthing after another,\\\" the poor lady grieved, in one of her rare revolts\\nagainst fate; \\\"the only thing that makes me think Mamma must be less\\nwell than Dr. Bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have Ellen\\ncome at once, however inconvenient it is to meet her.\\\"\\n\\nThe words had been thoughtless, as the utterances of impatience often\\nare; and Mr. Welland was upon them with a pounce.\\n\\n\\\"Augusta,\\\" he said, turning pale and laying down his fork, \\\"have you\\nany other reason for thinking that Bencomb is less to be relied on than\\nhe was?  Have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than\\nusual in following up my case or your mother's?\\\"\\n\\nIt was Mrs. Welland's turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of\\nher blunder unrolled themselves before her; but she managed to laugh,\\nand take a second helping of scalloped oysters, before she said,\\nstruggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness: \\\"My dear, how\\ncould you imagine such a thing?  I only meant that, after the decided\\nstand Mamma took about its being Ellen's duty to go back to her\\nhusband, it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden\\nwhim to see her, when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that\\nshe might have asked for.  But we must never forget that Mamma, in\\nspite of her wonderful vitality, is a very old woman.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Welland's brow remained clouded, and it was evident that his\\nperturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark.  \\\"Yes:\\nyour mother's a very old woman; and for all we know Bencomb may not be\\nas successful with very old people.  As you say, my dear, it's always\\none thing after another; and in another ten or fifteen years I suppose\\nI shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor.  It's\\nalways better to make such a change before it's absolutely necessary.\\\"\\nAnd having arrived at this Spartan decision Mr. Welland firmly took up\\nhis fork.\\n\\n\\\"But all the while,\\\" Mrs. Welland began again, as she rose from the\\nluncheon-table, and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and\\nmalachite known as the back drawing-room, \\\"I don't see how Ellen's to\\nbe got here tomorrow evening; and I do like to have things settled for\\nat least twenty-four hours ahead.\\\"\\n\\nArcher turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting\\nrepresenting two Cardinals carousing, in an octagonal ebony frame set\\nwith medallions of onyx.\\n\\n\\\"Shall I fetch her?\\\" he proposed.  \\\"I can easily get away from the\\noffice in time to meet the brougham at the ferry, if May will send it\\nthere.\\\"  His heart was beating excitedly as he spoke.\\n\\nMrs. Welland heaved a sigh of gratitude, and May, who had moved away to\\nthe window, turned to shed on him a beam of approval.  \\\"So you see,\\nMamma, everything WILL be settled twenty-four hours in advance,\\\" she\\nsaid, stooping over to kiss her mother's troubled forehead.\\n\\nMay's brougham awaited her at the door, and she was to drive Archer to\\nUnion Square, where he could pick up a Broadway car to carry him to the\\noffice.  As she settled herself in her corner she said:  \\\"I didn't want\\nto worry Mamma by raising fresh obstacles; but how can you meet Ellen\\ntomorrow, and bring her back to New York, when you're going to\\nWashington?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'm not going,\\\" Archer answered.\\n\\n\\\"Not going?  Why, what's happened?\\\"  Her voice was as clear as a bell,\\nand full of wifely solicitude.\\n\\n\\\"The case is off--postponed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Postponed?  How odd!  I saw a note this morning from Mr. Letterblair\\nto Mamma saying that he was going to Washington tomorrow for the big\\npatent case that he was to argue before the Supreme Court.  You said it\\nwas a patent case, didn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--that's it: the whole office can't go.  Letterblair decided to go\\nthis morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then it's NOT postponed?\\\" she continued, with an insistence so unlike\\nher that he felt the blood rising to his face, as if he were blushing\\nfor her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies.\\n\\n\\\"No: but my going is,\\\" he answered, cursing the unnecessary\\nexplanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of\\ngoing to Washington, and wondering where he had read that clever liars\\ngive details, but that the cleverest do not.  It did not hurt him half\\nas much to tell May an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she\\nhad not detected him.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your\\nfamily,\\\" he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm.  As he spoke he\\nfelt that she was looking at him, and he turned his eyes to hers in\\norder not to appear to be avoiding them.  Their glances met for a\\nsecond, and perhaps let them into each other's meanings more deeply\\nthan either cared to go.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; it IS awfully convenient,\\\" May brightly agreed, \\\"that you should\\nbe able to meet Ellen after all; you saw how much Mamma appreciated\\nyour offering to do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'm delighted to do it.\\\"  The carriage stopped, and as he jumped\\nout she leaned to him and laid her hand on his.  \\\"Good-bye, dearest,\\\"\\nshe said, her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone\\non him through tears.\\n\\nHe turned away and hurried across Union Square, repeating to himself,\\nin a sort of inward chant:  \\\"It's all of two hours from Jersey City to\\nold Catherine's.  It's all of two hours--and it may be more.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis wife's dark blue brougham (with the wedding varnish still on it)\\nmet Archer at the ferry, and conveyed him luxuriously to the\\nPennsylvania terminus in Jersey City.\\n\\nIt was a sombre snowy afternoon, and the gas-lamps were lit in the big\\nreverberating station.  As he paced the platform, waiting for the\\nWashington express, he remembered that there were people who thought\\nthere would one day be a tunnel under the Hudson through which the\\ntrains of the Pennsylvania railway would run straight into New York.\\nThey were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the\\nbuilding of ships that would cross the Atlantic in five days, the\\ninvention of a flying machine, lighting by electricity, telephonic\\ncommunication without wires, and other Arabian Night marvels.\\n\\n\\\"I don't care which of their visions comes true,\\\" Archer mused, \\\"as\\nlong as the tunnel isn't built yet.\\\"  In his senseless school-boy\\nhappiness he pictured Madame Olenska's descent from the train, his\\ndiscovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless\\nfaces, her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage, their\\nslow approach to the wharf among slipping horses, laden carts,\\nvociferating teamsters, and then the startling quiet of the ferry-boat,\\nwhere they would sit side by side under the snow, in the motionless\\ncarriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to\\nthe other side of the sun.  It was incredible, the number of things he\\nhad to say to her, and in what eloquent order they were forming\\nthemselves on his lips ...\\n\\nThe clanging and groaning of the train came nearer, and it staggered\\nslowly into the station like a prey-laden monster into its lair.\\nArcher pushed forward, elbowing through the crowd, and staring blindly\\ninto window after window of the high-hung carriages.  And then,\\nsuddenly, he saw Madame Olenska's pale and surprised face close at\\nhand, and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what\\nshe looked like.\\n\\nThey reached each other, their hands met, and he drew her arm through\\nhis.  \\\"This way--I have the carriage,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAfter that it all happened as he had dreamed.  He helped her into the\\nbrougham with her bags, and had afterward the vague recollection of\\nhaving properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a\\nsummary of the Beaufort situation (he was struck by the softness of\\nher:  \\\"Poor Regina!\\\").  Meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out\\nof the coil about the station, and they were crawling down the slippery\\nincline to the wharf, menaced by swaying coal-carts, bewildered horses,\\ndishevelled express-wagons, and an empty hearse--ah, that hearse!  She\\nshut her eyes as it passed, and clutched at Archer's hand.\\n\\n\\\"If only it doesn't mean--poor Granny!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, no--she's much better--she's all right, really.  There--we've\\npassed it!\\\" he exclaimed, as if that made all the difference.  Her hand\\nremained in his, and as the carriage lurched across the gang-plank onto\\nthe ferry he bent over, unbuttoned her tight brown glove, and kissed\\nher palm as if he had kissed a relic.  She disengaged herself with a\\nfaint smile, and he said: \\\"You didn't expect me today?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I meant to go to Washington to see you.  I'd made all my\\narrangements--I very nearly crossed you in the train.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh--\\\" she exclaimed, as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape.\\n\\n\\\"Do you know--I hardly remembered you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hardly remembered me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean: how shall I explain?  I--it's always so.  EACH TIME YOU HAPPEN\\nTO ME ALL OVER AGAIN.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes: I know!  I know!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Does it--do I too: to you?\\\" he insisted.\\n\\nShe nodded, looking out of the window.\\n\\n\\\"Ellen--Ellen--Ellen!\\\"\\n\\nShe made no answer, and he sat in silence, watching her profile grow\\nindistinct against the snow-streaked dusk beyond the window.  What had\\nshe been doing in all those four long months, he wondered?  How little\\nthey knew of each other, after all!  The precious moments were slipping\\naway, but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her\\nand could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and\\ntheir proximity, which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their\\nsitting so close to each other, and yet being unable to see each\\nother's faces.\\n\\n\\\"What a pretty carriage!  Is it May's?\\\" she asked, suddenly turning her\\nface from the window.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was May who sent you to fetch me, then?  How kind of her!\\\"\\n\\nHe made no answer for a moment; then he said explosively:  \\\"Your\\nhusband's secretary came to see me the day after we met in Boston.\\\"\\n\\nIn his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to M. Riviere's\\nvisit, and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom.\\nBut her reminder that they were in his wife's carriage provoked him to\\nan impulse of retaliation.  He would see if she liked his reference to\\nRiviere any better than he liked hers to May!  As on certain other\\noccasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure,\\nshe betrayed no sign of surprise: and at once he concluded:  \\\"He writes\\nto her, then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"M. Riviere went to see you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes: didn't you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she answered simply.\\n\\n\\\"And you're not surprised?\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated.  \\\"Why should I be?  He told me in Boston that he knew\\nyou; that he'd met you in England I think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ellen--I must ask you one thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to ask it after I saw him, but I couldn't put it in a letter.\\nIt was Riviere who helped you to get away--when you left your husband?\\\"\\n\\nHis heart was beating suffocatingly.  Would she meet this question with\\nthe same composure?\\n\\n\\\"Yes: I owe him a great debt,\\\" she answered, without the least tremor\\nin her quiet voice.\\n\\nHer tone was so natural, so almost indifferent, that Archer's turmoil\\nsubsided.  Once more she had managed, by her sheer simplicity, to make\\nhim feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging\\nconvention to the winds.\\n\\n\\\"I think you're the most honest woman I ever met!\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no--but probably one of the least fussy,\\\" she answered, a smile in\\nher voice.\\n\\n\\\"Call it what you like: you look at things as they are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--I've had to.  I've had to look at the Gorgon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--it hasn't blinded you!  You've seen that she's just an old bogey\\nlike all the others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She doesn't blind one; but she dries up one's tears.\\\"\\n\\nThe answer checked the pleading on Archer's lips: it seemed to come\\nfrom depths of experience beyond his reach.  The slow advance of the\\nferry-boat had ceased, and her bows bumped against the piles of the\\nslip with a violence that made the brougham stagger, and flung Archer\\nand Madame Olenska against each other.  The young man, trembling, felt\\nthe pressure of her shoulder, and passed his arm about her.\\n\\n\\\"If you're not blind, then, you must see that this can't last.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What can't?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Our being together--and not together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.  You ought not to have come today,\\\" she said in an altered voice;\\nand suddenly she turned, flung her arms about him and pressed her lips\\nto his.  At the same moment the carriage began to move, and a gas-lamp\\nat the head of the slip flashed its light into the window.  She drew\\naway, and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled\\nthrough the congestion of carriages about the ferry-landing.  As they\\ngained the street Archer began to speak hurriedly.\\n\\n\\\"Don't be afraid of me: you needn't squeeze yourself back into your\\ncorner like that.  A stolen kiss isn't what I want.  Look: I'm not even\\ntrying to touch the sleeve of your jacket.  Don't suppose that I don't\\nunderstand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us\\ndwindle into an ordinary hole-and-corner love-affair.  I couldn't have\\nspoken like this yesterday, because when we've been apart, and I'm\\nlooking forward to seeing you, every thought is burnt up in a great\\nflame.  But then you come; and you're so much more than I remembered,\\nand what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now\\nand then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit\\nperfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my\\nmind, just quietly trusting to it to come true.\\\"\\n\\nFor a moment she made no reply; then she asked, hardly above a whisper:\\n\\\"What do you mean by trusting to it to come true?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why--you know it will, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your vision of you and me together?\\\"  She burst into a sudden hard\\nlaugh.  \\\"You choose your place well to put it to me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean because we're in my wife's brougham?  Shall we get out and\\nwalk, then?  I don't suppose you mind a little snow?\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed again, more gently.  \\\"No; I shan't get out and walk,\\nbecause my business is to get to Granny's as quickly as I can.  And\\nyou'll sit beside me, and we'll look, not at visions, but at realities.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what you mean by realities.  The only reality to me is\\nthis.\\\"\\n\\nShe met the words with a long silence, during which the carriage rolled\\ndown an obscure side-street and then turned into the searching\\nillumination of Fifth Avenue.\\n\\n\\\"Is it your idea, then, that I should live with you as your\\nmistress--since I can't be your wife?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nThe crudeness of the question startled him: the word was one that women\\nof his class fought shy of, even when their talk flitted closest about\\nthe topic.  He noticed that Madame Olenska pronounced it as if it had a\\nrecognised place in her vocabulary, and he wondered if it had been used\\nfamiliarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from.  Her\\nquestion pulled him up with a jerk, and he floundered.\\n\\n\\\"I want--I want somehow to get away with you into a world where words\\nlike that--categories like that--won't exist.  Where we shall be simply\\ntwo human beings who love each other, who are the whole of life to each\\nother; and nothing else on earth will matter.\\\"\\n\\nShe drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh.  \\\"Oh, my dear--where\\nis that country?  Have you ever been there?\\\" she asked; and as he\\nremained sullenly dumb she went on:  \\\"I know so many who've tried to\\nfind it; and, believe me, they all got out by mistake at wayside\\nstations: at places like Boulogne, or Pisa, or Monte Carlo--and it\\nwasn't at all different from the old world they'd left, but only rather\\nsmaller and dingier and more promiscuous.\\\"\\n\\nHe had never heard her speak in such a tone, and he remembered the\\nphrase she had used a little while before.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, the Gorgon HAS dried your tears,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Well, she opened my eyes too; it's a delusion to say that she blinds\\npeople.  What she does is just the contrary--she fastens their eyelids\\nopen, so that they're never again in the blessed darkness.  Isn't there\\na Chinese torture like that?  There ought to be.  Ah, believe me, it's\\na miserable little country!\\\"\\n\\nThe carriage had crossed Forty-second Street: May's sturdy\\nbrougham-horse was carrying them northward as if he had been a Kentucky\\ntrotter.  Archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words.\\n\\n\\\"Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"For US?  But there's no US in that sense!  We're near each other only\\nif we stay far from each other.  Then we can be ourselves.  Otherwise\\nwe're only Newland Archer, the husband of Ellen Olenska's cousin, and\\nEllen Olenska, the cousin of Newland Archer's wife, trying to be happy\\nbehind the backs of the people who trust them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I'm beyond that,\\\" he groaned.\\n\\n\\\"No, you're not!  You've never been beyond.  And I have,\\\" she said, in\\na strange voice, \\\"and I know what it looks like there.\\\"\\n\\nHe sat silent, dazed with inarticulate pain.  Then he groped in the\\ndarkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to\\nthe coachman.  He remembered that May rang twice when she wished to\\nstop.  He pressed the bell, and the carriage drew up beside the\\ncurbstone.\\n\\n\\\"Why are we stopping?  This is not Granny's,\\\" Madame Olenska exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"No: I shall get out here,\\\" he stammered, opening the door and jumping\\nto the pavement.  By the light of a street-lamp he saw her startled\\nface, and the instinctive motion she made to detain him.  He closed the\\ndoor, and leaned for a moment in the window.\\n\\n\\\"You're right: I ought not to have come today,\\\" he said, lowering his\\nvoice so that the coachman should not hear.  She bent forward, and\\nseemed about to speak; but he had already called out the order to drive\\non, and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner.  The\\nsnow was over, and a tingling wind had sprung up, that lashed his face\\nas he stood gazing.  Suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his\\nlashes, and perceived that he had been crying, and that the wind had\\nfrozen his tears.\\n\\nHe thrust his hands in his pockets, and walked at a sharp pace down\\nFifth Avenue to his own house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat evening when Archer came down before dinner he found the\\ndrawing-room empty.\\n\\nHe and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been\\npostponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott's illness; and as May was the more\\npunctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him.  He\\nknew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving\\nabout in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.\\n\\nHe had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means\\nof tying his thoughts fast to reality.  Sometimes he felt as if he had\\nfound the clue to his father-in-law's absorption in trifles; perhaps\\neven Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had\\nconjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.\\n\\nWhen May appeared he thought she looked tired.  She had put on the\\nlow-necked and tightly-laced dinner-dress which the Mingott ceremonial\\nexacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair\\ninto its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan\\nand almost faded.  But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and\\nher eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.\\n\\n\\\"What became of you, dear?\\\" she asked.  \\\"I was waiting at Granny's, and\\nEllen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you\\nhad to rush off on business.  There's nothing wrong?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only some letters I'd forgotten, and wanted to get off before dinner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--\\\" she said; and a moment afterward:  \\\"I'm sorry you didn't come to\\nGranny's--unless the letters were urgent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They were,\\\" he rejoined, surprised at her insistence.  \\\"Besides, I\\ndon't see why I should have gone to your grandmother's.  I didn't know\\nyou were there.\\\"\\n\\nShe turned and moved to the looking-glass above the mantel-piece.  As\\nshe stood there, lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped\\nfrom its place in her intricate hair, Archer was struck by something\\nlanguid and inelastic in her attitude, and wondered if the deadly\\nmonotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also.  Then he\\nremembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called\\nover the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother's so that\\nthey might drive home together.  He had called back a cheery \\\"Yes!\\\" and\\nthen, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise.  Now he was\\nsmitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission\\nshould be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage.  He\\nwas weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the\\ntemperature of passion yet with all its exactions.  If May had spoken\\nout her grievances (he suspected her of many) he might have laughed\\nthem away; but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a\\nSpartan smile.\\n\\nTo disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was, and she\\nanswered that Mrs. Mingott was still improving, but had been rather\\ndisturbed by the last news about the Beauforts.\\n\\n\\\"What news?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems they're going to stay in New York.  I believe he's going into\\nan insurance business, or something.  They're looking about for a small\\nhouse.\\\"\\n\\nThe preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion, and they went\\nin to dinner.  During dinner their talk moved in its usual limited\\ncircle; but Archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to Madame\\nOlenska, nor to old Catherine's reception of her.  He was thankful for\\nthe fact, yet felt it to be vaguely ominous.\\n\\nThey went up to the library for coffee, and Archer lit a cigar and took\\ndown a volume of Michelet.  He had taken to history in the evenings\\nsince May had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she\\nsaw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his\\nown voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he\\nread.  In the days of their engagement she had simply (as he now\\nperceived) echoed what he told her; but since he had ceased to provide\\nher with opinions she had begun to hazard her own, with results\\ndestructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on.\\n\\nSeeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket, drew up\\nan arm-chair to the green-shaded student lamp, and uncovered a cushion\\nshe was embroidering for his sofa.  She was not a clever needle-woman;\\nher large capable hands were made for riding, rowing and open-air\\nactivities; but since other wives embroidered cushions for their\\nhusbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion.\\n\\nShe was so placed that Archer, by merely raising his eyes, could see\\nher bent above her work-frame, her ruffled elbow-sleeves slipping back\\nfrom her firm round arms, the betrothal sapphire shining on her left\\nhand above her broad gold wedding-ring, and the right hand slowly and\\nlaboriously stabbing the canvas.  As she sat thus, the lamplight full\\non her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he\\nwould always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years\\nto come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a\\nweakness, a cruelty or an emotion.  She had spent her poetry and\\nromance on their short courting: the function was exhausted because the\\nneed was past.  Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother,\\nand mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr.\\nWelland.  He laid down his book and stood up impatiently; and at once\\nshe raised her head.\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The room is stifling: I want a little air.\\\"\\n\\nHe had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and\\nforward on a rod, so that they might be closed in the evening, instead\\nof remaining nailed to a gilt cornice, and immovably looped up over\\nlayers of lace, as in the drawing-room; and he pulled them back and\\npushed up the sash, leaning out into the icy night.  The mere fact of\\nnot looking at May, seated beside his table, under his lamp, the fact\\nof seeing other houses, roofs, chimneys, of getting the sense of other\\nlives outside his own, other cities beyond New York, and a whole world\\nbeyond his world, cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe.\\n\\nAfter he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard\\nher say:  \\\"Newland!  Do shut the window.  You'll catch your death.\\\"\\n\\nHe pulled the sash down and turned back.  \\\"Catch my death!\\\" he echoed;\\nand he felt like adding:  \\\"But I've caught it already.  I AM dead--I've\\nbeen dead for months and months.\\\"\\n\\nAnd suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion.  What\\nif it were SHE who was dead!  If she were going to die--to die\\nsoon--and leave him free!  The sensation of standing there, in that\\nwarm familiar room, and looking at her, and wishing her dead, was so\\nstrange, so fascinating and overmastering, that its enormity did not\\nimmediately strike him.  He simply felt that chance had given him a new\\npossibility to which his sick soul might cling.  Yes, May might\\ndie--people did: young people, healthy people like herself: she might\\ndie, and set him suddenly free.\\n\\nShe glanced up, and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be\\nsomething strange in his own.\\n\\n\\\"Newland!  Are you ill?\\\"\\n\\nHe shook his head and turned toward his arm-chair.  She bent over her\\nwork-frame, and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair.  \\\"Poor May!\\\"\\nhe said.\\n\\n\\\"Poor?  Why poor?\\\" she echoed with a strained laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Because I shall never be able to open a window without worrying you,\\\"\\nhe rejoined, laughing also.\\n\\nFor a moment she was silent; then she said very low, her head bowed\\nover her work:  \\\"I shall never worry if you're happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my dear; and I shall never be happy unless I can open the windows!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In THIS weather?\\\" she remonstrated; and with a sigh he buried his head\\nin his book.\\n\\nSix or seven days passed.  Archer heard nothing from Madame Olenska,\\nand became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence\\nby any member of the family.  He did not try to see her; to do so while\\nshe was at old Catherine's guarded bedside would have been almost\\nimpossible.  In the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift,\\nconscious, somewhere below the surface of his thoughts, of a resolve\\nwhich had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window\\ninto the icy night.  The strength of that resolve made it easy to wait\\nand make no sign.\\n\\nThen one day May told him that Mrs. Manson Mingott had asked to see\\nhim.  There was nothing surprising in the request, for the old lady was\\nsteadily recovering, and she had always openly declared that she\\npreferred Archer to any of her other grandsons-in-law.  May gave the\\nmessage with evident pleasure: she was proud of old Catherine's\\nappreciation of her husband.\\n\\nThere was a moment's pause, and then Archer felt it incumbent on him to\\nsay:  \\\"All right.  Shall we go together this afternoon?\\\"\\n\\nHis wife's face brightened, but she instantly answered: \\\"Oh, you'd much\\nbetter go alone.  It bores Granny to see the same people too often.\\\"\\n\\nArcher's heart was beating violently when he rang old Mrs. Mingott's\\nbell.  He had wanted above all things to go alone, for he felt sure the\\nvisit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the\\nCountess Olenska.  He had determined to wait till the chance presented\\nitself naturally; and here it was, and here he was on the doorstep.\\nBehind the door, behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to\\nthe hall, she was surely awaiting him; in another moment he should see\\nher, and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sick-room.\\n\\nHe wanted only to put one question: after that his course would be\\nclear.  What he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to\\nWashington; and that question she could hardly refuse to answer.\\n\\nBut in the yellow sitting-room it was the mulatto maid who waited.  Her\\nwhite teeth shining like a keyboard, she pushed back the sliding doors\\nand ushered him into old Catherine's presence.\\n\\nThe old woman sat in a vast throne-like arm-chair near her bed.  Beside\\nher was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved\\nglobe, over which a green paper shade had been balanced.  There was not\\na book or a newspaper in reach, nor any evidence of feminine\\nemployment: conversation had always been Mrs. Mingott's sole pursuit,\\nand she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork.\\n\\nArcher saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke.  She\\nmerely looked paler, with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of\\nher obesity; and, in the fluted mob-cap tied by a starched bow between\\nher first two chins, and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing\\npurple dressing-gown, she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress\\nof her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the\\ntable.\\n\\nShe held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her\\nhuge lap like pet animals, and called to the maid:  \\\"Don't let in any\\none else.  If my daughters call, say I'm asleep.\\\"\\n\\nThe maid disappeared, and the old lady turned to her grandson.\\n\\n\\\"My dear, am I perfectly hideous?\\\" she asked gaily, launching out one\\nhand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom.  \\\"My\\ndaughters tell me it doesn't matter at my age--as if hideousness didn't\\nmatter all the more the harder it gets to conceal!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear, you're handsomer than ever!\\\" Archer rejoined in the same\\ntone; and she threw back her head and laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, but not as handsome as Ellen!\\\" she jerked out, twinkling at him\\nmaliciously; and before he could answer she added:  \\\"Was she so awfully\\nhandsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed, and she continued:  \\\"Was it because you told her so that\\nshe had to put you out on the way?  In my youth young men didn't desert\\npretty women unless they were made to!\\\"  She gave another chuckle, and\\ninterrupted it to say almost querulously:  \\\"It's a pity she didn't\\nmarry you; I always told her so.  It would have spared me all this\\nworry.  But who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry?\\\"\\n\\nArcher wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties; but suddenly\\nshe broke out:  \\\"Well, it's settled, anyhow: she's going to stay with\\nme, whatever the rest of the family say!  She hadn't been here five\\nminutes before I'd have gone down on my knees to keep her--if only, for\\nthe last twenty years, I'd been able to see where the floor was!\\\"\\n\\nArcher listened in silence, and she went on:  \\\"They'd talked me over,\\nas no doubt you know: persuaded me, Lovell, and Letterblair, and\\nAugusta Welland, and all the rest of them, that I must hold out and cut\\noff her allowance, till she was made to see that it was her duty to go\\nback to Olenski.  They thought they'd convinced me when the secretary,\\nor whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome\\nproposals I confess they were.  After all, marriage is marriage, and\\nmoney's money--both useful things in their way ... and I didn't know\\nwhat to answer--\\\"  She broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking\\nhad become an effort.  \\\"But the minute I laid eyes on her, I said:\\n'You sweet bird, you!  Shut you up in that cage again?  Never!'  And\\nnow it's settled that she's to stay here and nurse her Granny as long\\nas there's a Granny to nurse.  It's not a gay prospect, but she doesn't\\nmind; and of course I've told Letterblair that she's to be given her\\nproper allowance.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind\\nhe hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain.  He had so\\ndefinitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment\\nhe could not readjust his thoughts.  But gradually there stole over him\\nthe delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities\\nmiraculously provided.  If Ellen had consented to come and live with\\nher grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the\\nimpossibility of giving him up.  This was her answer to his final\\nappeal of the other day: if she would not take the extreme step he had\\nurged, she had at last yielded to half-measures.  He sank back into the\\nthought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk\\neverything, and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security.\\n\\n\\\"She couldn't have gone back--it was impossible!\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my dear, I always knew you were on her side; and that's why I sent\\nfor you today, and why I said to your pretty wife, when she proposed to\\ncome with you: 'No, my dear, I'm pining to see Newland, and I don't\\nwant anybody to share our transports.'  For you see, my dear--\\\" she\\ndrew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted, and looked\\nhim full in the eyes--\\\"you see, we shall have a fight yet.  The family\\ndon't want her here, and they'll say it's because I've been ill,\\nbecause I'm a weak old woman, that she's persuaded me.  I'm not well\\nenough yet to fight them one by one, and you've got to do it for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I?\\\" he stammered.\\n\\n\\\"You.  Why not?\\\" she jerked back at him, her round eyes suddenly as\\nsharp as pen-knives.  Her hand fluttered from its chair-arm and lit on\\nhis with a clutch of little pale nails like bird-claws.  \\\"Why not?\\\" she\\nsearchingly repeated.\\n\\nArcher, under the exposure of her gaze, had recovered his\\nself-possession.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't count--I'm too insignificant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you're Letterblair's partner, ain't you?  You've got to get at\\nthem through Letterblair.  Unless you've got a reason,\\\" she insisted.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my dear, I back you to hold your own against them all without my\\nhelp; but you shall have it if you need it,\\\" he reassured her.\\n\\n\\\"Then we're safe!\\\" she sighed; and smiling on him with all her ancient\\ncunning she added, as she settled her head among the cushions:  \\\"I\\nalways knew you'd back us up, because they never quote you when they\\ntalk about its being her duty to go home.\\\"\\n\\nHe winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity, and longed to ask:\\n\\\"And May--do they quote her?\\\"  But he judged it safer to turn the\\nquestion.\\n\\n\\\"And Madame Olenska?  When am I to see her?\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe old lady chuckled, crumpled her lids, and went through the\\npantomime of archness.  \\\"Not today.  One at a time, please.  Madame\\nOlenska's gone out.\\\"\\n\\nHe flushed with disappointment, and she went on: \\\"She's gone out, my\\nchild: gone in my carriage to see Regina Beaufort.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused for this announcement to produce its effect.  \\\"That's what\\nshe's reduced me to already.  The day after she got here she put on her\\nbest bonnet, and told me, as cool as a cucumber, that she was going to\\ncall on Regina Beaufort.  'I don't know her; who is she?' says I.\\n'She's your grand-niece, and a most unhappy woman,' she says.  'She's\\nthe wife of a scoundrel,' I answered.  'Well,' she says, 'and so am I,\\nand yet all my family want me to go back to him.'  Well, that floored\\nme, and I let her go; and finally one day she said it was raining too\\nhard to go out on foot, and she wanted me to lend her my carriage.\\n'What for?' I asked her; and she said: 'To go and see cousin\\nRegina'--COUSIN!  Now, my dear, I looked out of the window, and saw it\\nwasn't raining a drop; but I understood her, and I let her have the\\ncarriage....  After all, Regina's a brave woman, and so is she; and\\nI've always liked courage above everything.\\\"\\n\\nArcher bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay\\non his.\\n\\n\\\"Eh--eh--eh!  Whose hand did you think you were kissing, young\\nman--your wife's, I hope?\\\" the old lady snapped out with her mocking\\ncackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him:  \\\"Give her her\\nGranny's love; but you'd better not say anything about our talk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArcher had been stunned by old Catherine's news.  It was only natural\\nthat Madame Olenska should have hastened from Washington in response to\\nher grandmother's summons; but that she should have decided to remain\\nunder her roof--especially now that Mrs. Mingott had almost regained\\nher health--was less easy to explain.\\n\\nArcher was sure that Madame Olenska's decision had not been influenced\\nby the change in her financial situation.  He knew the exact figure of\\nthe small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation.\\nWithout the addition of her grandmother's allowance it was hardly\\nenough to live on, in any sense known to the Mingott vocabulary; and\\nnow that Medora Manson, who shared her life, had been ruined, such a\\npittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed.  Yet Archer\\nwas convinced that Madame Olenska had not accepted her grandmother's\\noffer from interested motives.\\n\\nShe had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of\\npersons used to large fortunes, and indifferent to money; but she could\\ngo without many things which her relations considered indispensable,\\nand Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Welland had often been heard to\\ndeplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of Count\\nOlenski's establishments should care so little about \\\"how things were\\ndone.\\\"  Moreover, as Archer knew, several months had passed since her\\nallowance had been cut off; yet in the interval she had made no effort\\nto regain her grandmother's favour.  Therefore if she had changed her\\ncourse it must be for a different reason.\\n\\nHe did not have far to seek for that reason.  On the way from the ferry\\nshe had told him that he and she must remain apart; but she had said it\\nwith her head on his breast.  He knew that there was no calculated\\ncoquetry in her words; she was fighting her fate as he had fought his,\\nand clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break\\nfaith with the people who trusted them.  But during the ten days which\\nhad elapsed since her return to New York she had perhaps guessed from\\nhis silence, and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her,\\nthat he was meditating a decisive step, a step from which there was no\\nturning back.  At the thought, a sudden fear of her own weakness might\\nhave seized her, and she might have felt that, after all, it was better\\nto accept the compromise usual in such cases, and follow the line of\\nleast resistance.\\n\\nAn hour earlier, when he had rung Mrs. Mingott's bell, Archer had\\nfancied that his path was clear before him.  He had meant to have a\\nword alone with Madame Olenska, and failing that, to learn from her\\ngrandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to\\nWashington.  In that train he intended to join her, and travel with her\\nto Washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go.  His own\\nfancy inclined to Japan.  At any rate she would understand at once\\nthat, wherever she went, he was going.  He meant to leave a note for\\nMay that should cut off any other alternative.\\n\\nHe had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to\\ntake it; yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was\\nchanged had been one of relief.  Now, however, as he walked home from\\nMrs. Mingott's, he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay\\nbefore him.  There was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was\\npresumably to tread; but when he had trodden it before it was as a free\\nman, who was accountable to no one for his actions, and could lend\\nhimself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and\\nprevarications, concealments and compliances, that the part required.\\nThis procedure was called \\\"protecting a woman's honour\\\"; and the best\\nfiction, combined with the after-dinner talk of his elders, had long\\nsince initiated him into every detail of its code.\\n\\nNow he saw the matter in a new light, and his part in it seemed\\nsingularly diminished.  It was, in fact, that which, with a secret\\nfatuity, he had watched Mrs. Thorley Rushworth play toward a fond and\\nunperceiving husband: a smiling, bantering, humouring, watchful and\\nincessant lie.  A lie by day, a lie by night, a lie in every touch and\\nevery look; a lie in every caress and every quarrel; a lie in every\\nword and in every silence.\\n\\nIt was easier, and less dastardly on the whole, for a wife to play such\\na part toward her husband.  A woman's standard of truthfulness was\\ntacitly held to be lower: she was the subject creature, and versed in\\nthe arts of the enslaved.  Then she could always plead moods and\\nnerves, and the right not to be held too strictly to account; and even\\nin the most strait-laced societies the laugh was always against the\\nhusband.\\n\\nBut in Archer's little world no one laughed at a wife deceived, and a\\ncertain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their\\nphilandering after marriage.  In the rotation of crops there was a\\nrecognised season for wild oats; but they were not to be sown more than\\nonce.\\n\\nArcher had always shared this view: in his heart he thought Lefferts\\ndespicable.  But to love Ellen Olenska was not to become a man like\\nLefferts: for the first time Archer found himself face to face with the\\ndread argument of the individual case.  Ellen Olenska was like no other\\nwoman, he was like no other man: their situation, therefore, resembled\\nno one else's, and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of\\ntheir own judgment.\\n\\nYes, but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep; and\\nthere were May, and habit, and honour, and all the old decencies that\\nhe and his people had always believed in ...\\n\\nAt his corner he hesitated, and then walked on down Fifth Avenue.\\n\\nAhead of him, in the winter night, loomed a big unlit house.  As he\\ndrew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights, its\\nsteps awninged and carpeted, and carriages waiting in double line to\\ndraw up at the curbstone.  It was in the conservatory that stretched\\nits dead-black bulk down the side street that he had taken his first\\nkiss from May; it was under the myriad candles of the ball-room that he\\nhad seen her appear, tall and silver-shining as a young Diana.\\n\\nNow the house was as dark as the grave, except for a faint flare of gas\\nin the basement, and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had\\nnot been lowered.  As Archer reached the corner he saw that the\\ncarriage standing at the door was Mrs. Manson Mingott's.  What an\\nopportunity for Sillerton Jackson, if he should chance to pass!  Archer\\nhad been greatly moved by old Catherine's account of Madame Olenska's\\nattitude toward Mrs. Beaufort; it made the righteous reprobation of New\\nYork seem like a passing by on the other side.  But he knew well enough\\nwhat construction the clubs and drawing-rooms would put on Ellen\\nOlenska's visits to her cousin.\\n\\nHe paused and looked up at the lighted window.  No doubt the two women\\nwere sitting together in that room: Beaufort had probably sought\\nconsolation elsewhere.  There were even rumours that he had left New\\nYork with Fanny Ring; but Mrs. Beaufort's attitude made the report seem\\nimprobable.\\n\\nArcher had the nocturnal perspective of Fifth Avenue almost to himself.\\nAt that hour most people were indoors, dressing for dinner; and he was\\nsecretly glad that Ellen's exit was likely to be unobserved.  As the\\nthought passed through his mind the door opened, and she came out.\\nBehind her was a faint light, such as might have been carried down the\\nstairs to show her the way.  She turned to say a word to some one; then\\nthe door closed, and she came down the steps.\\n\\n\\\"Ellen,\\\" he said in a low voice, as she reached the pavement.\\n\\nShe stopped with a slight start, and just then he saw two young men of\\nfashionable cut approaching.  There was a familiar air about their\\novercoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their\\nwhite ties; and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be\\ndining out so early.  Then he remembered that the Reggie Chiverses,\\nwhose house was a few doors above, were taking a large party that\\nevening to see Adelaide Neilson in Romeo and Juliet, and guessed that\\nthe two were of the number.  They passed under a lamp, and he\\nrecognised Lawrence Lefferts and a young Chivers.\\n\\nA mean desire not to have Madame Olenska seen at the Beauforts' door\\nvanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand.\\n\\n\\\"I shall see you now--we shall be together,\\\" he broke out, hardly\\nknowing what he said.\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" she answered, \\\"Granny has told you?\\\"\\n\\nWhile he watched her he was aware that Lefferts and Chivers, on\\nreaching the farther side of the street corner, had discreetly struck\\naway across Fifth Avenue.  It was the kind of masculine solidarity that\\nhe himself often practised; now he sickened at their connivance.  Did\\nshe really imagine that he and she could live like this?  And if not,\\nwhat else did she imagine?\\n\\n\\\"Tomorrow I must see you--somewhere where we can be alone,\\\" he said, in\\na voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears.\\n\\nShe wavered, and moved toward the carriage.\\n\\n\\\"But I shall be at Granny's--for the present that is,\\\" she added, as if\\nconscious that her change of plans required some explanation.\\n\\n\\\"Somewhere where we can be alone,\\\" he insisted.\\n\\nShe gave a faint laugh that grated on him.\\n\\n\\\"In New York?  But there are no churches ... no monuments.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's the Art Museum--in the Park,\\\" he explained, as she looked\\npuzzled.  \\\"At half-past two.  I shall be at the door ...\\\"\\n\\nShe turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage.\\nAs it drove off she leaned forward, and he thought she waved her hand\\nin the obscurity.  He stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory\\nfeelings.  It seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman\\nhe loved but to another, a woman he was indebted to for pleasures\\nalready wearied of: it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this\\nhackneyed vocabulary.\\n\\n\\\"She'll come!\\\" he said to himself, almost contemptuously.\\n\\nAvoiding the popular \\\"Wolfe collection,\\\" whose anecdotic canvases\\nfilled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of cast-iron\\nand encaustic tiles known as the Metropolitan Museum, they had wandered\\ndown a passage to the room where the \\\"Cesnola antiquities\\\" mouldered in\\nunvisited loneliness.\\n\\nThey had this melancholy retreat to themselves, and seated on the divan\\nenclosing the central steam-radiator, they were staring silently at the\\nglass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered\\nfragments of Ilium.\\n\\n\\\"It's odd,\\\" Madame Olenska said, \\\"I never came here before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well--.  Some day, I suppose, it will be a great Museum.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she assented absently.\\n\\nShe stood up and wandered across the room.  Archer, remaining seated,\\nwatched the light movements of her figure, so girlish even under its\\nheavy furs, the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap, and the way\\na dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the\\near.  His mind, as always when they first met, was wholly absorbed in\\nthe delicious details that made her herself and no other.  Presently he\\nrose and approached the case before which she stood.  Its glass shelves\\nwere crowded with small broken objects--hardly recognisable domestic\\nutensils, ornaments and personal trifles--made of glass, of clay, of\\ndiscoloured bronze and other time-blurred substances.\\n\\n\\\"It seems cruel,\\\" she said, \\\"that after a while nothing matters ... any\\nmore than these little things, that used to be necessary and important\\nto forgotten people, and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying\\nglass and labelled:  'Use unknown.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but meanwhile--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, meanwhile--\\\"\\n\\nAs she stood there, in her long sealskin coat, her hands thrust in a\\nsmall round muff, her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the\\ntip of her nose, and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring\\nwith her quickly-taken breath, it seemed incredible that this pure\\nharmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change.\\n\\n\\\"Meanwhile everything matters--that concerns you,\\\" he said.\\n\\nShe looked at him thoughtfully, and turned back to the divan.  He sat\\ndown beside her and waited; but suddenly he heard a step echoing far\\noff down the empty rooms, and felt the pressure of the minutes.\\n\\n\\\"What is it you wanted to tell me?\\\" she asked, as if she had received\\nthe same warning.\\n\\n\\\"What I wanted to tell you?\\\" he rejoined.  \\\"Why, that I believe you\\ncame to New York because you were afraid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Afraid?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of my coming to Washington.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked down at her muff, and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily.\\n\\n\\\"Well--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--yes,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"You WERE afraid?  You knew--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes: I knew ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then?\\\" he insisted.\\n\\n\\\"Well, then: this is better, isn't it?\\\" she returned with a long\\nquestioning sigh.\\n\\n\\\"Better--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We shall hurt others less.  Isn't it, after all, what you always\\nwanted?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To have you here, you mean--in reach and yet out of reach?  To meet\\nyou in this way, on the sly?  It's the very reverse of what I want.  I\\ntold you the other day what I wanted.\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated.  \\\"And you still think this--worse?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A thousand times!\\\"  He paused.  \\\"It would be easy to lie to you; but\\nthe truth is I think it detestable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, so do I!\\\" she cried with a deep breath of relief.\\n\\nHe sprang up impatiently.  \\\"Well, then--it's my turn to ask: what is\\nit, in God's name, that you think better?\\\"\\n\\nShe hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her\\nmuff.  The step drew nearer, and a guardian in a braided cap walked\\nlistlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis.\\nThey fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them, and\\nwhen the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and\\nsarcophagi Archer spoke again.\\n\\n\\\"What do you think better?\\\"\\n\\nInstead of answering she murmured:  \\\"I promised Granny to stay with her\\nbecause it seemed to me that here I should be safer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From me?\\\"\\n\\nShe bent her head slightly, without looking at him.\\n\\n\\\"Safer from loving me?\\\"\\n\\nHer profile did not stir, but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and\\nhang in a mesh of her veil.\\n\\n\\\"Safer from doing irreparable harm.  Don't let us be like all the\\nothers!\\\" she protested.\\n\\n\\\"What others?  I don't profess to be different from my kind.  I'm\\nconsumed by the same wants and the same longings.\\\"\\n\\nShe glanced at him with a kind of terror, and he saw a faint colour\\nsteal into her cheeks.\\n\\n\\\"Shall I--once come to you; and then go home?\\\" she suddenly hazarded in\\na low clear voice.\\n\\nThe blood rushed to the young man's forehead.  \\\"Dearest!\\\" he said,\\nwithout moving.  It seemed as if he held his heart in his hands, like a\\nfull cup that the least motion might overbrim.\\n\\nThen her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded.  \\\"Go home?\\nWhat do you mean by going home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Home to my husband.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you expect me to say yes to that?\\\"\\n\\nShe raised her troubled eyes to his.  \\\"What else is there?  I can't\\nstay here and lie to the people who've been good to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But that's the very reason why I ask you to come away!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?\\\"\\n\\nArcher sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate\\ndespair.  It would have been easy to say:  \\\"Yes, come; come once.\\\"  He\\nknew the power she would put in his hands if she consented; there would\\nbe no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband.\\n\\nBut something silenced the word on his lips.  A sort of passionate\\nhonesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her\\ninto that familiar trap.  \\\"If I were to let her come,\\\" he said to\\nhimself, \\\"I should have to let her go again.\\\"  And that was not to be\\nimagined.\\n\\nBut he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek, and wavered.\\n\\n\\\"After all,\\\" he began again, \\\"we have lives of our own....  There's no\\nuse attempting the impossible.  You're so unprejudiced about some\\nthings, so used, as you say, to looking at the Gorgon, that I don't\\nknow why you're afraid to face our case, and see it as it really\\nis--unless you think the sacrifice is not worth making.\\\"\\n\\nShe stood up also, her lips tightening under a rapid frown.\\n\\n\\\"Call it that, then--I must go,\\\" she said, drawing her little watch\\nfrom her bosom.\\n\\nShe turned away, and he followed and caught her by the wrist.  \\\"Well,\\nthen: come to me once,\\\" he said, his head turning suddenly at the\\nthought of losing her; and for a second or two they looked at each\\nother almost like enemies.\\n\\n\\\"When?\\\" he insisted.  \\\"Tomorrow?\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated.  \\\"The day after.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dearest--!\\\" he said again.\\n\\nShe had disengaged her wrist; but for a moment they continued to hold\\neach other's eyes, and he saw that her face, which had grown very pale,\\nwas flooded with a deep inner radiance.  His heart beat with awe: he\\nfelt that he had never before beheld love visible.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I shall be late--good-bye.  No, don't come any farther than this,\\\"\\nshe cried, walking hurriedly away down the long room, as if the\\nreflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her.  When she reached\\nthe door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell.\\n\\nArcher walked home alone.  Darkness was falling when he let himself\\ninto his house, and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall\\nas if he viewed them from the other side of the grave.\\n\\nThe parlour-maid, hearing his step, ran up the stairs to light the gas\\non the upper landing.\\n\\n\\\"Is Mrs. Archer in?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, sir; Mrs. Archer went out in the carriage after luncheon, and\\nhasn't come back.\\\"\\n\\nWith a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in\\nhis armchair.  The parlour-maid followed, bringing the student lamp and\\nshaking some coals onto the dying fire.  When she left he continued to\\nsit motionless, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his clasped hands,\\nhis eyes fixed on the red grate.\\n\\nHe sat there without conscious thoughts, without sense of the lapse of\\ntime, in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather\\nthan quicken it.  \\\"This was what had to be, then ... this was what had\\nto be,\\\" he kept repeating to himself, as if he hung in the clutch of\\ndoom.  What he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a\\nmortal chill in his rapture.\\n\\nThe door opened and May came in.\\n\\n\\\"I'm dreadfully late--you weren't worried, were you?\\\" she asked, laying\\nher hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses.\\n\\nHe looked up astonished.  \\\"Is it late?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After seven.  I believe you've been asleep!\\\"  She laughed, and drawing\\nout her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa.  She looked paler\\nthan usual, but sparkling with an unwonted animation.\\n\\n\\\"I went to see Granny, and just as I was going away Ellen came in from\\na walk; so I stayed and had a long talk with her.  It was ages since\\nwe'd had a real talk....\\\" She had dropped into her usual armchair,\\nfacing his, and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair.  He\\nfancied she expected him to speak.\\n\\n\\\"A really good talk,\\\" she went on, smiling with what seemed to Archer\\nan unnatural vividness.  \\\"She was so dear--just like the old Ellen.\\nI'm afraid I haven't been fair to her lately.  I've sometimes thought--\\\"\\n\\nArcher stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece, out of the radius\\nof the lamp.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you've thought--?\\\" he echoed as she paused.\\n\\n\\\"Well, perhaps I haven't judged her fairly.  She's so different--at\\nleast on the surface.  She takes up such odd people--she seems to like\\nto make herself conspicuous.  I suppose it's the life she's led in that\\nfast European society; no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her.  But I\\ndon't want to judge her unfairly.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused again, a little breathless with the unwonted length of her\\nspeech, and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her\\ncheeks.\\n\\nArcher, as he looked at her, was reminded of the glow which had\\nsuffused her face in the Mission Garden at St. Augustine.  He became\\naware of the same obscure effort in her, the same reaching out toward\\nsomething beyond the usual range of her vision.\\n\\n\\\"She hates Ellen,\\\" he thought, \\\"and she's trying to overcome the\\nfeeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it.\\\"\\n\\nThe thought moved him, and for a moment he was on the point of breaking\\nthe silence between them, and throwing himself on her mercy.\\n\\n\\\"You understand, don't you,\\\" she went on, \\\"why the family have\\nsometimes been annoyed?  We all did what we could for her at first; but\\nshe never seemed to understand.  And now this idea of going to see Mrs.\\nBeaufort, of going there in Granny's carriage!  I'm afraid she's quite\\nalienated the van der Luydens ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said Archer with an impatient laugh.  The open door had closed\\nbetween them again.\\n\\n\\\"It's time to dress; we're dining out, aren't we?\\\" he asked, moving\\nfrom the fire.\\n\\nShe rose also, but lingered near the hearth.  As he walked past her she\\nmoved forward impulsively, as though to detain him: their eyes met, and\\nhe saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her\\nto drive to Jersey City.\\n\\nShe flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his.\\n\\n\\\"You haven't kissed me today,\\\" she said in a whisper; and he felt her\\ntremble in his arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"At the court of the Tuileries,\\\" said Mr. Sillerton Jackson with his\\nreminiscent smile, \\\"such things were pretty openly tolerated.\\\"\\n\\nThe scene was the van der Luydens' black walnut dining-room in Madison\\nAvenue, and the time the evening after Newland Archer's visit to the\\nMuseum of Art.  Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had come to town for a few\\ndays from Skuytercliff, whither they had precipitately fled at the\\nannouncement of Beaufort's failure.  It had been represented to them\\nthat the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable\\naffair made their presence in town more necessary than ever.  It was\\none of the occasions when, as Mrs. Archer put it, they \\\"owed it to\\nsociety\\\" to show themselves at the Opera, and even to open their own\\ndoors.\\n\\n\\\"It will never do, my dear Louisa, to let people like Mrs. Lemuel\\nStruthers think they can step into Regina's shoes.  It is just at such\\ntimes that new people push in and get a footing.  It was owing to the\\nepidemic of chicken-pox in New York the winter Mrs. Struthers first\\nappeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their\\nwives were in the nursery.  You and dear Henry, Louisa, must stand in\\nthe breach as you always have.\\\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. van der Luyden could not remain deaf to such a call, and\\nreluctantly but heroically they had come to town, unmuffled the house,\\nand sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception.\\n\\nOn this particular evening they had invited Sillerton Jackson, Mrs.\\nArcher and Newland and his wife to go with them to the Opera, where\\nFaust was being sung for the first time that winter.  Nothing was done\\nwithout ceremony under the van der Luyden roof, and though there were\\nbut four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually, so that the\\nproper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the\\ngentlemen settled down to their cigars.\\n\\nArcher had not seen his wife since the evening before.  He had left\\nearly for the office, where he had plunged into an accumulation of\\nunimportant business.  In the afternoon one of the senior partners had\\nmade an unexpected call on his time; and he had reached home so late\\nthat May had preceded him to the van der Luydens', and sent back the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nNow, across the Skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate, she\\nstruck him as pale and languid; but her eyes shone, and she talked with\\nexaggerated animation.\\n\\nThe subject which had called forth Mr. Sillerton Jackson's favourite\\nallusion had been brought up (Archer fancied not without intention) by\\ntheir hostess.  The Beaufort failure, or rather the Beaufort attitude\\nsince the failure, was still a fruitful theme for the drawing-room\\nmoralist; and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned Mrs.\\nvan der Luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on May Archer.\\n\\n\\\"Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true?  I was told your\\ngrandmother Mingott's carriage was seen standing at Mrs. Beaufort's\\ndoor.\\\"  It was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady\\nby her Christian name.\\n\\nMay's colour rose, and Mrs. Archer put in hastily: \\\"If it was, I'm\\nconvinced it was there without Mrs. Mingott's knowledge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you think--?\\\"  Mrs. van der Luyden paused, sighed, and glanced at\\nher husband.\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid,\\\" Mr. van der Luyden said, \\\"that Madame Olenska's kind\\nheart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on Mrs. Beaufort.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or her taste for peculiar people,\\\" put in Mrs. Archer in a dry tone,\\nwhile her eyes dwelt innocently on her son's.\\n\\n\\\"I'm sorry to think it of Madame Olenska,\\\" said Mrs. van der Luyden;\\nand Mrs. Archer murmured: \\\"Ah, my dear--and after you'd had her twice\\nat Skuytercliff!\\\"\\n\\nIt was at this point that Mr. Jackson seized the chance to place his\\nfavourite allusion.\\n\\n\\\"At the Tuileries,\\\" he repeated, seeing the eyes of the company\\nexpectantly turned on him, \\\"the standard was excessively lax in some\\nrespects; and if you'd asked where Morny's money came from--!  Or who\\npaid the debts of some of the Court beauties ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope, dear Sillerton,\\\" said Mrs. Archer, \\\"you are not suggesting\\nthat we should adopt such standards?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never suggest,\\\" returned Mr. Jackson imperturbably.  \\\"But Madame\\nOlenska's foreign bringing-up may make her less particular--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" the two elder ladies sighed.\\n\\n\\\"Still, to have kept her grandmother's carriage at a defaulter's door!\\\"\\nMr. van der Luyden protested; and Archer guessed that he was\\nremembering, and resenting, the hampers of carnations he had sent to\\nthe little house in Twenty-third Street.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I've always said that she looks at things quite\\ndifferently,\\\" Mrs. Archer summed up.\\n\\nA flush rose to May's forehead.  She looked across the table at her\\nhusband, and said precipitately:  \\\"I'm sure Ellen meant it kindly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Imprudent people are often kind,\\\" said Mrs. Archer, as if the fact\\nwere scarcely an extenuation; and Mrs. van der Luyden murmured:  \\\"If\\nonly she had consulted some one--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, that she never did!\\\" Mrs. Archer rejoined.\\n\\nAt this point Mr. van der Luyden glanced at his wife, who bent her head\\nslightly in the direction of Mrs. Archer; and the glimmering trains of\\nthe three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down\\nto their cigars.  Mr. van der Luyden supplied short ones on Opera\\nnights; but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his\\ninexorable punctuality.\\n\\nArcher, after the first act, had detached himself from the party and\\nmade his way to the back of the club box.  From there he watched, over\\nvarious Chivers, Mingott and Rushworth shoulders, the same scene that\\nhe had looked at, two years previously, on the night of his first\\nmeeting with Ellen Olenska.  He had half-expected her to appear again\\nin old Mrs. Mingott's box, but it remained empty; and he sat\\nmotionless, his eyes fastened on it, till suddenly Madame Nilsson's\\npure soprano broke out into \\\"M'ama, non m'ama ...\\\"\\n\\nArcher turned to the stage, where, in the familiar setting of giant\\nroses and pen-wiper pansies, the same large blonde victim was\\nsuccumbing to the same small brown seducer.\\n\\nFrom the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where\\nMay sat between two older ladies, just as, on that former evening, she\\nhad sat between Mrs. Lovell Mingott and her newly-arrived \\\"foreign\\\"\\ncousin.  As on that evening, she was all in white; and Archer, who had\\nnot noticed what she wore, recognised the blue-white satin and old lace\\nof her wedding dress.\\n\\nIt was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in this costly\\ngarment during the first year or two of marriage: his mother, he knew,\\nkept hers in tissue paper in the hope that Janey might some day wear\\nit, though poor Janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and\\nno bridesmaids would be thought more \\\"appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nIt struck Archer that May, since their return from Europe, had seldom\\nworn her bridal satin, and the surprise of seeing her in it made him\\ncompare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with\\nsuch blissful anticipations two years earlier.\\n\\nThough May's outline was slightly heavier, as her goddesslike build had\\nforetold, her athletic erectness of carriage, and the girlish\\ntransparency of her expression, remained unchanged: but for the slight\\nlanguor that Archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the\\nexact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her betrothal evening.  The fact seemed an\\nadditional appeal to his pity: such innocence was as moving as the\\ntrustful clasp of a child.  Then he remembered the passionate\\ngenerosity latent under that incurious calm.  He recalled her glance of\\nunderstanding when he had urged that their engagement should be\\nannounced at the Beaufort ball; he heard the voice in which she had\\nsaid, in the Mission garden:  \\\"I couldn't have my happiness made out of\\na wrong--a wrong to some one else;\\\" and an uncontrollable longing\\nseized him to tell her the truth, to throw himself on her generosity,\\nand ask for the freedom he had once refused.\\n\\nNewland Archer was a quiet and self-controlled young man.  Conformity\\nto the discipline of a small society had become almost his second\\nnature.  It was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic\\nand conspicuous, anything Mr. van der Luyden would have deprecated and\\nthe club box condemned as bad form.  But he had become suddenly\\nunconscious of the club box, of Mr. van der Luyden, of all that had so\\nlong enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit.  He walked along the\\nsemi-circular passage at the back of the house, and opened the door of\\nMrs. van der Luyden's box as if it had been a gate into the unknown.\\n\\n\\\"M'ama!\\\" thrilled out the triumphant Marguerite; and the occupants of\\nthe box looked up in surprise at Archer's entrance.  He had already\\nbroken one of the rules of his world, which forbade the entering of a\\nbox during a solo.\\n\\nSlipping between Mr. van der Luyden and Sillerton Jackson, he leaned\\nover his wife.\\n\\n\\\"I've got a beastly headache; don't tell any one, but come home, won't\\nyou?\\\" he whispered.\\n\\nMay gave him a glance of comprehension, and he saw her whisper to his\\nmother, who nodded sympathetically; then she murmured an excuse to Mrs.\\nvan der Luyden, and rose from her seat just as Marguerite fell into\\nFaust's arms.  Archer, while he helped her on with her Opera cloak,\\nnoticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies.\\n\\nAs they drove away May laid her hand shyly on his.  \\\"I'm so sorry you\\ndon't feel well.  I'm afraid they've been overworking you again at the\\noffice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No--it's not that: do you mind if I open the window?\\\" he returned\\nconfusedly, letting down the pane on his side.  He sat staring out into\\nthe street, feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful\\ninterrogation, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing\\nhouses.  At their door she caught her skirt in the step of the\\ncarriage, and fell against him.\\n\\n\\\"Did you hurt yourself?\\\" he asked, steadying her with his arm.\\n\\n\\\"No; but my poor dress--see how I've torn it!\\\" she exclaimed.  She bent\\nto gather up a mud-stained breadth, and followed him up the steps into\\nthe hall.  The servants had not expected them so early, and there was\\nonly a glimmer of gas on the upper landing.\\n\\nArcher mounted the stairs, turned up the light, and put a match to the\\nbrackets on each side of the library mantelpiece.  The curtains were\\ndrawn, and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of\\na familiar face met during an unavowable errand.\\n\\nHe noticed that his wife was very pale, and asked if he should get her\\nsome brandy.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" she exclaimed with a momentary flush, as she took off her\\ncloak.  \\\"But hadn't you better go to bed at once?\\\" she added, as he\\nopened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette.\\n\\nArcher threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the\\nfire.\\n\\n\\\"No; my head is not as bad as that.\\\"  He paused.  \\\"And there's\\nsomething I want to say; something important--that I must tell you at\\nonce.\\\"\\n\\nShe had dropped into an armchair, and raised her head as he spoke.\\n\\\"Yes, dear?\\\" she rejoined, so gently that he wondered at the lack of\\nwonder with which she received this preamble.\\n\\n\\\"May--\\\" he began, standing a few feet from her chair, and looking over\\nat her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable\\nabyss.  The sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike\\nhush, and he repeated:  \\\"There is something I've got to tell you ...\\nabout myself ...\\\"\\n\\nShe sat silent, without a movement or a tremor of her lashes.  She was\\nstill extremely pale, but her face had a curious tranquillity of\\nexpression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source.\\n\\nArcher checked the conventional phrases of self-accusal that were\\ncrowding to his lips.  He was determined to put the case baldly,\\nwithout vain recrimination or excuse.\\n\\n\\\"Madame Olenska--\\\" he said; but at the name his wife raised her hand as\\nif to silence him.  As she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of\\nher wedding-ring.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, why should we talk about Ellen tonight?\\\" she asked, with a slight\\npout of impatience.\\n\\n\\\"Because I ought to have spoken before.\\\"\\n\\nHer face remained calm.  \\\"Is it really worth while, dear?  I know I've\\nbeen unfair to her at times--perhaps we all have.  You've understood\\nher, no doubt, better than we did: you've always been kind to her.  But\\nwhat does it matter, now it's all over?\\\"\\n\\nArcher looked at her blankly.  Could it be possible that the sense of\\nunreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself\\nto his wife?\\n\\n\\\"All over--what do you mean?\\\" he asked in an indistinct stammer.\\n\\nMay still looked at him with transparent eyes.  \\\"Why--since she's going\\nback to Europe so soon; since Granny approves and understands, and has\\narranged to make her independent of her husband--\\\"\\n\\nShe broke off, and Archer, grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in\\none convulsed hand, and steadying himself against it, made a vain\\neffort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts.\\n\\n\\\"I supposed,\\\" he heard his wife's even voice go on, \\\"that you had been\\nkept at the office this evening about the business arrangements.  It\\nwas settled this morning, I believe.\\\"  She lowered her eyes under his\\nunseeing stare, and another fugitive flush passed over her face.\\n\\nHe understood that his own eyes must be unbearable, and turning away,\\nrested his elbows on the mantel-shelf and covered his face.  Something\\ndrummed and clanged furiously in his ears; he could not tell if it were\\nthe blood in his veins, or the tick of the clock on the mantel.\\n\\nMay sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out\\nfive minutes.  A lump of coal fell forward in the grate, and hearing\\nher rise to push it back, Archer at length turned and faced her.\\n\\n\\\"It's impossible,\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Impossible--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you know--what you've just told me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw Ellen yesterday--I told you I'd seen her at Granny's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't then that she told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; I had a note from her this afternoon.--Do you want to see it?\\\"\\n\\nHe could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came\\nback almost immediately.\\n\\n\\\"I thought you knew,\\\" she said simply.\\n\\nShe laid a sheet of paper on the table, and Archer put out his hand and\\ntook it up.  The letter contained only a few lines.\\n\\n\\\"May dear, I have at last made Granny understand that my visit to her\\ncould be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as\\never.  She sees now that if I return to Europe I must live by myself,\\nor rather with poor Aunt Medora, who is coming with me. I am hurrying\\nback to Washington to pack up, and we sail next week.  You must be very\\ngood to Granny when I'm gone--as good as you've always been to me.\\nEllen.\\n\\n\\\"If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell\\nthem it would be utterly useless.\\\"\\n\\nArcher read the letter over two or three times; then he flung it down\\nand burst out laughing.\\n\\nThe sound of his laugh startled him.  It recalled Janey's midnight\\nfright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over\\nMay's telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been\\nadvanced.\\n\\n\\\"Why did she write this?\\\" he asked, checking his laugh with a supreme\\neffort.\\n\\nMay met the question with her unshaken candour.  \\\"I suppose because we\\ntalked things over yesterday--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I told her I was afraid I hadn't been fair to her--hadn't always\\nunderstood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many\\npeople who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to\\ncriticise, and yet didn't always know the circumstances.\\\" She paused.\\n\\\"I knew you'd been the one friend she could always count on; and I\\nwanted her to know that you and I were the same--in all our feelings.\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated, as if waiting for him to speak, and then added slowly:\\n\\\"She understood my wishing to tell her this.  I think she understands\\neverything.\\\"\\n\\nShe went up to Archer, and taking one of his cold hands pressed it\\nquickly against her cheek.\\n\\n\\\"My head aches too; good-night, dear,\\\" she said, and turned to the\\ndoor, her torn and muddy wedding-dress dragging after her across the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was, as Mrs. Archer smilingly said to Mrs. Welland, a great event\\nfor a young couple to give their first big dinner.\\n\\nThe Newland Archers, since they had set up their household, had\\nreceived a good deal of company in an informal way.  Archer was fond of\\nhaving three or four friends to dine, and May welcomed them with the\\nbeaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in\\nconjugal affairs.  Her husband questioned whether, if left to herself,\\nshe would ever have asked any one to the house; but he had long given\\nup trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which\\ntradition and training had moulded her.  It was expected that well-off\\nyoung couples in New York should do a good deal of informal\\nentertaining, and a Welland married to an Archer was doubly pledged to\\nthe tradition.\\n\\nBut a big dinner, with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen, with\\nRoman punch, roses from Henderson's, and menus on gilt-edged cards, was\\na different affair, and not to be lightly undertaken.  As Mrs. Archer\\nremarked, the Roman punch made all the difference; not in itself but by\\nits manifold implications--since it signified either canvas-backs or\\nterrapin, two soups, a hot and a cold sweet, full decolletage with\\nshort sleeves, and guests of a proportionate importance.\\n\\nIt was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their\\nfirst invitations in the third person, and their summons was seldom\\nrefused even by the seasoned and sought-after.  Still, it was\\nadmittedly a triumph that the van der Luydens, at May's request, should\\nhave stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the\\nCountess Olenska.\\n\\nThe two mothers-in-law sat in May's drawing-room on the afternoon of\\nthe great day, Mrs. Archer writing out the menus on Tiffany's thickest\\ngilt-edged bristol, while Mrs. Welland superintended the placing of the\\npalms and standard lamps.\\n\\nArcher, arriving late from his office, found them still there.  Mrs.\\nArcher had turned her attention to the name-cards for the table, and\\nMrs. Welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large\\ngilt sofa, so that another \\\"corner\\\" might be created between the piano\\nand the window.\\n\\nMay, they told him, was in the dining-room inspecting the mound of\\nJacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table, and\\nthe placing of the Maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between\\nthe candelabra.  On the piano stood a large basket of orchids which Mr.\\nvan der Luyden had had sent from Skuytercliff.  Everything was, in\\nshort, as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event.\\n\\nMrs. Archer ran thoughtfully over the list, checking off each name with\\nher sharp gold pen.\\n\\n\\\"Henry van der Luyden--Louisa--the Lovell Mingotts--the Reggie\\nChiverses--Lawrence Lefferts and Gertrude--(yes, I suppose May was\\nright to have them)--the Selfridge Merrys, Sillerton Jackson, Van\\nNewland and his wife. (How time passes!  It seems only yesterday that\\nhe was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think\\nthat's all....\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately.  \\\"No one can say,\\nNewland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well,\\\" said Mrs. Archer, \\\"I understand May's wanting her cousin to\\ntell people abroad that we're not quite barbarians.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure Ellen will appreciate it.  She was to arrive this morning, I\\nbelieve.  It will make a most charming last impression.  The evening\\nbefore sailing is usually so dreary,\\\" Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued.\\n\\nArcher turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him:\\n\\\"Do go in and have a peep at the table.  And don't let May tire herself\\ntoo much.\\\"  But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to\\nhis library.  The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed\\ninto a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly\\n\\\"tidied,\\\" and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and\\ncedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well,\\\" he thought, \\\"it's not for long--\\\" and he went on to his\\ndressing-room.\\n\\nTen days had passed since Madame Olenska's departure from New York.\\nDuring those ten days Archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed\\nby the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper, and sent to his office\\nin a sealed envelope addressed in her hand.  This retort to his last\\nappeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar\\ngame; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning.  She was\\nstill fighting against her fate; but she was going to Europe, and she\\nwas not returning to her husband.  Nothing, therefore, was to prevent\\nhis following her; and once he had taken the irrevocable step, and had\\nproved to her that it was irrevocable, he believed she would not send\\nhim away.\\n\\nThis confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the\\npresent.  It had kept him from writing to her, or betraying, by any\\nsign or act, his misery and mortification.  It seemed to him that in\\nthe deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands;\\nand he waited.\\n\\nThere had been, nevertheless, moments sufficiently difficult to pass;\\nas when Mr. Letterblair, the day after Madame Olenska's departure, had\\nsent for him to go over the details of the trust which Mrs. Manson\\nMingott wished to create for her granddaughter.  For a couple of hours\\nArcher had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the\\nwhile obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some\\nreason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close\\nof the conference would reveal it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, the lady can't deny that it's a handsome arrangement,\\\" Mr.\\nLetterblair had summed up, after mumbling over a summary of the\\nsettlement.  \\\"In fact I'm bound to say she's been treated pretty\\nhandsomely all round.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All round?\\\" Archer echoed with a touch of derision.  \\\"Do you refer to\\nher husband's proposal to give her back her own money?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Letterblair's bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch.  \\\"My\\ndear sir, the law's the law; and your wife's cousin was married under\\nthe French law.  It's to be presumed she knew what that meant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Even if she did, what happened subsequently--.\\\"  But Archer paused.\\nMr. Letterblair had laid his pen-handle against his big corrugated\\nnose, and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous\\nelderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that\\nvirtue is not synonymous with ignorance.\\n\\n\\\"My dear sir, I've no wish to extenuate the Count's transgressions;\\nbut--but on the other side ... I wouldn't put my hand in the fire ...\\nwell, that there hadn't been tit for tat ... with the young\\nchampion....\\\"  Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded\\npaper toward Archer.  \\\"This report, the result of discreet enquiries\\n...\\\"  And then, as Archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to\\nrepudiate the suggestion, the lawyer somewhat flatly continued:  \\\"I\\ndon't say it's conclusive, you observe; far from it.  But straws show\\n... and on the whole it's eminently satisfactory for all parties that\\nthis dignified solution has been reached.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, eminently,\\\" Archer assented, pushing back the paper.\\n\\nA day or two later, on responding to a summons from Mrs. Manson\\nMingott, his soul had been more deeply tried.\\n\\nHe had found the old lady depressed and querulous.\\n\\n\\\"You know she's deserted me?\\\" she began at once; and without waiting\\nfor his reply:  \\\"Oh, don't ask me why!  She gave so many reasons that\\nI've forgotten them all.  My private belief is that she couldn't face\\nthe boredom.  At any rate that's what Augusta and my daughters-in-law\\nthink.  And I don't know that I altogether blame her.  Olenski's a\\nfinished scoundrel; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer\\nthan it is in Fifth Avenue.  Not that the family would admit that: they\\nthink Fifth Avenue is Heaven with the rue de la Paix thrown in.  And\\npoor Ellen, of course, has no idea of going back to her husband.  She\\nheld out as firmly as ever against that.  So she's to settle down in\\nParis with that fool Medora....  Well, Paris is Paris; and you can keep\\na carriage there on next to nothing.  But she was as gay as a bird, and\\nI shall miss her.\\\" Two tears, the parched tears of the old, rolled down\\nher puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom.\\n\\n\\\"All I ask is,\\\" she concluded, \\\"that they shouldn't bother me any more.\\nI must really be allowed to digest my gruel....\\\"  And she twinkled a\\nlittle wistfully at Archer.\\n\\nIt was that evening, on his return home, that May announced her\\nintention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin.  Madame Olenska's\\nname had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight\\nto Washington; and Archer looked at his wife with surprise.\\n\\n\\\"A dinner--why?\\\" he interrogated.\\n\\nHer colour rose.  \\\"But you like Ellen--I thought you'd be pleased.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's awfully nice--your putting it in that way.  But I really don't\\nsee--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean to do it, Newland,\\\" she said, quietly rising and going to her\\ndesk.  \\\"Here are the invitations all written.  Mother helped me--she\\nagrees that we ought to.\\\"  She paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and\\nArcher suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, all right,\\\" he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of\\nguests that she had put in his hand.\\n\\nWhen he entered the drawing-room before dinner May was stooping over\\nthe fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed\\nsetting of immaculate tiles.\\n\\nThe tall lamps were all lit, and Mr. van der Luyden's orchids had been\\nconspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and\\nknobby silver.  Mrs. Newland Archer's drawing-room was generally\\nthought a great success.  A gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the\\nprimulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed, blocked the access to\\nthe bay window (where the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze\\nreduction of the Venus of Milo); the sofas and arm-chairs of pale\\nbrocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered\\nwith silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames;\\nand tall rosy-shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the\\npalms.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think Ellen has ever seen this room lighted up,\\\" said May,\\nrising flushed from her struggle, and sending about her a glance of\\npardonable pride.  The brass tongs which she had propped against the\\nside of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband's\\nanswer; and before he could restore them Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden\\nwere announced.\\n\\nThe other guests quickly followed, for it was known that the van der\\nLuydens liked to dine punctually.  The room was nearly full, and Archer\\nwas engaged in showing to Mrs. Selfridge Merry a small highly-varnished\\nVerbeckhoven \\\"Study of Sheep,\\\" which Mr. Welland had given May for\\nChristmas, when he found Madame Olenska at his side.\\n\\nShe was excessively pale, and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser\\nand heavier than ever.  Perhaps that, or the fact that she had wound\\nseveral rows of amber beads about her neck, reminded him suddenly of\\nthe little Ellen Mingott he had danced with at children's parties, when\\nMedora Manson had first brought her to New York.\\n\\nThe amber beads were trying to her complexion, or her dress was perhaps\\nunbecoming: her face looked lustreless and almost ugly, and he had\\nnever loved it as he did at that minute.  Their hands met, and he\\nthought he heard her say:  \\\"Yes, we're sailing tomorrow in the\\nRussia--\\\"; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors, and\\nafter an interval May's voice:  \\\"Newland!  Dinner's been announced.\\nWon't you please take Ellen in?\\\"\\n\\nMadame Olenska put her hand on his arm, and he noticed that the hand\\nwas ungloved, and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the\\nevening that he had sat with her in the little Twenty-third Street\\ndrawing-room.  All the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have\\ntaken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on\\nhis sleeve, and he said to himself: \\\"If it were only to see her hand\\nagain I  should  have  to follow her--.\\\"\\n\\nIt was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a \\\"foreign\\nvisitor\\\" that Mrs. van der Luyden could suffer the diminution of being\\nplaced on her host's left.  The fact of Madame Olenska's \\\"foreignness\\\"\\ncould hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell\\ntribute; and Mrs. van der Luyden accepted her displacement with an\\naffability which left no doubt as to her approval.  There were certain\\nthings that had to be done, and if done at all, done handsomely and\\nthoroughly; and one of these, in the old New York code, was the tribal\\nrally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.  There\\nwas nothing on earth that the Wellands and Mingotts would not have done\\nto proclaim their unalterable affection for the Countess Olenska now\\nthat her passage for Europe was engaged; and Archer, at the head of his\\ntable, sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her\\npopularity had been retrieved, grievances against her silenced, her\\npast countenanced, and her present irradiated by the family approval.\\nMrs. van der Luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her\\nnearest approach to cordiality, and Mr. van der Luyden, from his seat\\nat May's right, cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify\\nall the carnations he had sent from Skuytercliff.\\n\\nArcher, who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd\\nimponderability, as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and\\nceiling, wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the\\nproceedings.  As his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to\\nanother he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon May's\\ncanvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale\\nwoman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy.  And then it came\\nover him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of\\nthem he and Madame Olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense\\npeculiar to \\\"foreign\\\" vocabularies.  He guessed himself to have been,\\nfor months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and\\npatiently listening ears; he understood that, by means as yet unknown\\nto him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had\\nbeen achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife\\non the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined\\nanything, and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply May\\nArcher's natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and\\ncousin.\\n\\nIt was the old New York way of taking life \\\"without effusion of blood\\\":\\nthe way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed\\ndecency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more\\nill-bred than \\\"scenes,\\\" except the behaviour of those who gave rise to\\nthem.\\n\\nAs these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind Archer felt like a\\nprisoner in the centre of an armed camp.  He looked about the table,\\nand guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in\\nwhich, over the asparagus from Florida, they were dealing with Beaufort\\nand his wife.  \\\"It's to show me,\\\" he thought, \\\"what would happen to\\nME--\\\" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy\\nover direct action, and of silence over rash words, closed in on him\\nlike the doors of the family vault.\\n\\nHe laughed, and met Mrs. van der Luyden's startled eyes.\\n\\n\\\"You think it laughable?\\\" she said with a pinched smile.  \\\"Of course\\npoor Regina's idea of remaining in New York has its ridiculous side, I\\nsuppose;\\\" and Archer muttered:  \\\"Of course.\\\"\\n\\nAt this point, he became conscious that Madame Olenska's other\\nneighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right.\\nAt the same moment he saw that May, serenely enthroned between Mr. van\\nder Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, had cast a quick glance down the\\ntable.  It was evident that the host and the lady on his right could\\nnot sit through the whole meal in silence.  He turned to Madame\\nOlenska, and her pale smile met him.  \\\"Oh, do let's see it through,\\\" it\\nseemed to say.\\n\\n\\\"Did you find the journey tiring?\\\" he asked in a voice that surprised\\nhim by its naturalness; and she answered that, on the contrary, she had\\nseldom travelled with fewer discomforts.\\n\\n\\\"Except, you know, the dreadful heat in the train,\\\" she added; and he\\nremarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the\\ncountry she was going to.\\n\\n\\\"I never,\\\" he declared with intensity, \\\"was more nearly frozen than\\nonce, in April, in the train between Calais and Paris.\\\"\\n\\nShe said she did not wonder, but remarked that, after all, one could\\nalways carry an extra rug, and that every form of travel had its\\nhardships; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no\\naccount compared with the blessedness of getting away.  She changed\\ncolour, and he added, his voice suddenly rising in pitch:  \\\"I mean to\\ndo a lot of travelling myself before long.\\\"  A tremor crossed her face,\\nand leaning over to Reggie Chivers, he cried out:  \\\"I say, Reggie, what\\ndo you say to a trip round the world: now, next month, I mean?  I'm\\ngame if you are--\\\" at which Mrs. Reggie piped up that she could not\\nthink of letting Reggie go till after the Martha Washington Ball she\\nwas getting up for the Blind Asylum in Easter week; and her husband\\nplacidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for\\nthe International Polo match.\\n\\nBut Mr. Selfridge Merry had caught the phrase \\\"round the world,\\\" and\\nhaving once circled the globe in his steam-yacht, he seized the\\nopportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning\\nthe shallowness of the Mediterranean ports.  Though, after all, he\\nadded, it didn't matter; for when you'd seen Athens and Smyrna and\\nConstantinople, what else was there?  And Mrs. Merry said she could\\nnever be too grateful to Dr. Bencomb for having made them promise not\\nto go to Naples on account of the fever.\\n\\n\\\"But you must have three weeks to do India properly,\\\" her husband\\nconceded, anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous\\nglobe-trotter.\\n\\nAnd at this point the ladies went up to the drawing-room.\\n\\nIn the library, in spite of weightier presences, Lawrence Lefferts\\npredominated.\\n\\nThe talk, as usual, had veered around to the Beauforts, and even Mr.\\nvan der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, installed in the honorary\\narm-chairs tacitly reserved for them, paused to listen to the younger\\nman's philippic.\\n\\nNever had Lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn Christian\\nmanhood and exalt the sanctity of the home.  Indignation lent him a\\nscathing eloquence, and it was clear that if others had followed his\\nexample, and acted as he talked, society would never have been weak\\nenough to receive a foreign upstart like Beaufort--no, sir, not even if\\nhe'd married a van der Luyden or a Lanning instead of a Dallas.  And\\nwhat chance would there have been, Lefferts wrathfully questioned, of\\nhis marrying into such a family as the Dallases, if he had not already\\nwormed his way into certain houses, as people like Mrs. Lemuel\\nStruthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake?  If society chose to\\nopen its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great, though the gain\\nwas doubtful; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure\\norigin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration--and at no\\ndistant date.\\n\\n\\\"If things go on at this pace,\\\" Lefferts thundered, looking like a\\nyoung prophet dressed by Poole, and who had not yet been stoned, \\\"we\\nshall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses,\\nand marrying Beaufort's bastards.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I say--draw it mild!\\\" Reggie Chivers and young Newland protested,\\nwhile Mr. Selfridge Merry looked genuinely alarmed, and an expression\\nof pain and disgust settled on Mr. van der Luyden's sensitive face.\\n\\n\\\"Has he got any?\\\" cried Mr. Sillerton Jackson, pricking up his ears;\\nand while Lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh, the old\\ngentleman twittered into Archer's ear:  \\\"Queer, those fellows who are\\nalways wanting to set things right.  The people who have the worst\\ncooks are always telling you they're poisoned when they dine out.  But\\nI hear there are pressing reasons for our friend Lawrence's\\ndiatribe:--typewriter this time, I understand....\\\"\\n\\nThe talk swept past Archer like some senseless river running and\\nrunning because it did not know enough to stop.  He saw, on the faces\\nabout him, expressions of interest, amusement and even mirth.  He\\nlistened to the younger men's laughter, and to the praise of the Archer\\nMadeira, which Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Merry were thoughtfully\\ncelebrating.  Through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude\\nof friendliness toward himself, as if the guard of the prisoner he felt\\nhimself to be were trying to soften his captivity; and the perception\\nincreased his passionate determination to be free.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room, where they presently joined the ladies, he met\\nMay's triumphant eyes, and read in them the conviction that everything\\nhad \\\"gone off\\\" beautifully.  She rose from Madame Olenska's side, and\\nimmediately Mrs. van der Luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the\\ngilt sofa where she throned.  Mrs. Selfridge Merry bore across the room\\nto join them, and it became clear to Archer that here also a conspiracy\\nof rehabilitation and obliteration was going on.  The silent\\norganisation which held his little world together was determined to put\\nitself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety\\nof Madame Olenska's conduct, or the completeness of Archer's domestic\\nfelicity.  All these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely\\nengaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of,\\nsuspected, or even conceived possible, the least hint to the contrary;\\nand from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation Archer once more\\ndisengaged the fact that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska's\\nlover.  He caught the glitter of victory in his wife's eyes, and for\\nthe first time understood that she shared the belief.  The discovery\\nroused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his\\nefforts to discuss the Martha Washington ball with Mrs. Reggie Chivers\\nand little Mrs. Newland; and so the evening swept on, running and\\nrunning like a senseless river that did not know how to stop.\\n\\nAt length he saw that Madame Olenska had risen and was saying good-bye.\\nHe understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember\\nwhat he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single\\nword they had exchanged.\\n\\nShe went up to May, the rest of the company making a circle about her\\nas she advanced.  The two young women clasped hands; then May bent\\nforward and kissed her cousin.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two,\\\" Archer heard\\nReggie Chivers say in an undertone to young Mrs. Newland; and he\\nremembered Beaufort's coarse sneer at May's ineffectual beauty.\\n\\nA moment later he was in the hall, putting Madame Olenska's cloak about\\nher shoulders.\\n\\nThrough all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to\\nsay nothing that might startle or disturb her.  Convinced that no power\\ncould now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events\\nshape themselves as they would.  But as he followed Madame Olenska into\\nthe hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone\\nwith her at the door of her carriage.\\n\\n\\\"Is your carriage here?\\\" he asked; and at that moment Mrs. van der\\nLuyden, who was being majestically inserted into her sables, said\\ngently:  \\\"We are driving dear Ellen home.\\\"\\n\\nArcher's heart gave a jerk, and Madame Olenska, clasping her cloak and\\nfan with one hand, held out the other to him.  \\\"Good-bye,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye--but I shall see you soon in Paris,\\\" he answered aloud--it\\nseemed to him that he had shouted it.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" she murmured, \\\"if you and May could come--!\\\"\\n\\nMr. van der Luyden advanced to give her his arm, and Archer turned to\\nMrs. van der Luyden.  For a moment, in the billowy darkness inside the\\nbig landau, he caught the dim oval of a face, eyes shining\\nsteadily--and she was gone.\\n\\nAs he went up the steps he crossed Lawrence Lefferts coming down with\\nhis wife.  Lefferts caught his host by the sleeve, drawing back to let\\nGertrude pass.\\n\\n\\\"I say, old chap: do you mind just letting it be understood that I'm\\ndining with you at the club tomorrow night?  Thanks so much, you old\\nbrick!  Good-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It DID go off beautifully, didn't it?\\\" May questioned from the\\nthreshold of the library.\\n\\nArcher roused himself with a start.  As soon as the last carriage had\\ndriven away, he had come up to the library and shut himself in, with\\nthe hope that his wife, who still lingered below, would go straight to\\nher room.  But there she stood, pale and drawn, yet radiating the\\nfactitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue.\\n\\n\\\"May I come and talk it over?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, if you like.  But you must be awfully sleepy--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I'm not sleepy.  I should like to sit with you a little.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" he said, pushing her chair near the fire.\\n\\nShe sat down and he resumed his seat; but neither spoke for a long\\ntime.  At length Archer began abruptly: \\\"Since you're not tired, and\\nwant to talk, there's something I must tell you.  I tried to the other\\nnight--.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him quickly.  \\\"Yes, dear.  Something about yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About myself.  You say you're not tired: well, I am.  Horribly tired\\n...\\\"\\n\\nIn an instant she was all tender anxiety.  \\\"Oh, I've seen it coming on,\\nNewland!  You've been so wickedly overworked--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps it's that.  Anyhow, I want to make a break--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A break?  To give up the law?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To go away, at any rate--at once.  On a long trip, ever so far\\noff--away from everything--\\\"\\n\\nHe paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with\\nthe indifference of a man who longs for a change, and is yet too weary\\nto welcome it.  Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated.\\n\\\"Away from everything--\\\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\\"Ever so far?  Where, for instance?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't know.  India--or Japan.\\\"\\n\\nShe stood up, and as he sat with bent head, his chin propped on his\\nhands, he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him.\\n\\n\\\"As far as that?  But I'm afraid you can't, dear ...\\\" she said in an\\nunsteady voice.  \\\"Not unless you'll take me with you.\\\"  And then, as he\\nwas silent, she went on, in tones so clear and evenly-pitched that each\\nseparate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain:  \\\"That is,\\nif the doctors will let me go ... but I'm afraid they won't.  For you\\nsee, Newland, I've been sure since this morning of something I've been\\nso longing and hoping for--\\\"\\n\\nHe looked up at her with a sick stare, and she sank down, all dew and\\nroses, and hid her face against his knee.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my dear,\\\" he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked\\nher hair.\\n\\nThere was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident\\nlaughter; then May freed herself from his arms and stood up.\\n\\n\\\"You didn't guess--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--I; no.  That is, of course I hoped--\\\"\\n\\nThey looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then,\\nturning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly:  \\\"Have you told any one\\nelse?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only Mamma and your mother.\\\"  She paused, and then added hurriedly,\\nthe blood flushing up to her forehead:  \\\"That is--and Ellen.  You know\\nI told you we'd had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to\\nme.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--\\\" said Archer, his heart stopping.\\n\\nHe felt that his wife was watching him intently.  \\\"Did you MIND my\\ntelling her first, Newland?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mind?  Why should I?\\\"  He made a last effort to collect himself.  \\\"But\\nthat was a fortnight ago, wasn't it?  I thought you said you weren't\\nsure till today.\\\"\\n\\nHer colour burned deeper, but she held his gaze.  \\\"No; I wasn't sure\\nthen--but I told her I was.  And you see I was right!\\\" she exclaimed,\\nher blue eyes wet with victory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNewland Archer sat at the writing-table in his library in East\\nThirty-ninth Street.\\n\\nHe had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration\\nof the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, and the spectacle of\\nthose great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the\\nthrong of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically\\ncatalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory.\\n\\n\\\"Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms,\\\" he heard some one\\nsay; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting\\nalone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure\\nin a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely-fitted vista of\\nthe old Museum.\\n\\nThe vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking\\nwith new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the\\nscene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations.\\n\\nIt was the room in which most of the real things of his life had\\nhappened.  There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\\nchild; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to\\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop\\nof New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the\\npride and ornament of his diocese.  There Dallas had first staggered\\nacross the floor shouting \\\"Dad,\\\" while May and the nurse laughed behind\\nthe door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother),\\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie\\nChivers's many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her\\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\\nto Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\\nfoundations the \\\"Grace Church wedding\\\" remained an unchanged\\ninstitution.\\n\\nIt was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future\\nof the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill,\\nMary's incurable indifference to \\\"accomplishments,\\\" and passion for\\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward \\\"art\\\" which had\\nfinally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a\\nrising New York architect.\\n\\nThe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  If they were not\\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\\nthey were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture\\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\\nGeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\\n\\\"Colonial.\\\"  Nobody nowadays had \\\"Colonial\\\" houses except the\\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\\n\\nBut above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that\\nlibrary that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one\\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\\n\\\"Hang the professional politician!  You're the kind of man the country\\nwants, Archer.  If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you\\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Men like you--\\\" how Archer had glowed at the phrase!  How eagerly he\\nhad risen up at the call!  It was an echo of Ned Winsett's old appeal\\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\\nirresistible.\\n\\nArcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what\\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore\\nRoosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\\nfor after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and\\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\\napathy.  It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\\nwall.  He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship\\nto be his strength and pride.\\n\\nHe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call \\\"a good\\ncitizen.\\\"  In New York, for many years past, every new movement,\\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\\nand wanted his name.  People said:  \\\"Ask Archer\\\" when there was a\\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\\nreorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating\\nthe new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  His\\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  He supposed it was all\\na man ought to ask.\\n\\nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  But he thought of\\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\\nprize in a lottery.  There were a hundred million tickets in HIS\\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\\ndecidedly against him.  When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was\\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\\nhad missed.  That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\\nfrom thinking of other women.  He had been what was called a faithful\\nhusband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\\nhonestly mourned her.  Their long years together had shown him that it\\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\\nugly appetites.  Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\\nmourned for it.  After all, there was good in the old ways.\\n\\nHis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with\\nEnglish mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake\\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\\nfirst photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\\n\\nThere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\\nand flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\\nMission garden.  And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  This hard\\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\\nHer incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\\nviews from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  And she had\\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\\nconvinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate\\nin Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\\nparents' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her)\\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.  And of Mary she was\\nsure as of her own self.  So, having snatched little Bill from the\\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\\nplace in the Archer vault in St.  Mark's, where Mrs. Archer already lay\\nsafe from the terrifying \\\"trend\\\" which her daughter-in-law had never\\neven become aware of.\\n\\nOpposite May's portrait stood one of her daughter.  Mary Chivers was as\\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  Mary Chivers's\\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\\ntwenty-inch waist that May Archer's azure sash so easily spanned.  And\\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely\\ngirt as her figure.  Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  There\\nwas good in the new order too.\\n\\nThe telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs,\\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  How far they were from the days\\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York's\\nonly means of quick communication!\\n\\n\\\"Chicago wants you.\\\"\\n\\nAh--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to\\nChicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they\\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  The firm always sent\\nDallas on such errands.\\n\\n\\\"Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas.  I say--how do you feel about sailing on\\nWednesday?  Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is.  Our client\\nwants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and\\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  I've got to be back on the\\nfirst of June--\\\" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--\\\"so we\\nmust look alive.  I say, Dad, I want your help: do come.\\\"\\n\\nDallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\\nfire.  The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for\\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\\nelectric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages.  But the laugh did\\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\\nbusy indifferent millions--Dallas's laugh should be able to say: \\\"Of\\ncourse, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny\\nBeaufort and I are to be married on the fifth.\\\"\\n\\nThe voice began again:  \\\"Think it over?  No, sir: not a minute.  You've\\ngot to say yes now.  Why not, I'd like to know?  If you can allege a\\nsingle reason--No; I knew it.  Then it's a go, eh?  Because I count on\\nyou to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better\\nbook a return on a boat from Marseilles.  I say, Dad; it'll be our last\\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  Oh, good!  I knew you would.\\\"\\n\\nChicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the\\nroom.\\n\\nIt would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\\nright.  They would have lots of other \\\"times\\\" after Dallas's marriage,\\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny\\nBeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\\ninterfere with their intimacy.  On the contrary, from what he had seen\\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  Still,\\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\\n\\nThere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  May had disliked to move except\\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\\nThirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands' in\\nNewport.  After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\\nold-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy.  Their time\\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France.  Archer\\nremembered Dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc\\ninstead of Rheims and Chartres.  But Mary and Bill wanted\\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas's wake\\nthrough the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children,\\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\\nartistic proclivities.  She had indeed proposed that her husband should\\ngo to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after\\nthey had \\\"done\\\" Switzerland; but Archer had declined.  \\\"We'll stick\\ntogether,\\\" he said; and May's face had brightened at his setting such a\\ngood example to Dallas.\\n\\nSince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\\nhis continuing in the same routine.  His children had urged him to\\ntravel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\\nand \\\"see the galleries.\\\"  The very mysteriousness of such a cure made\\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  But Archer had found himself\\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\\nnew things.\\n\\nNow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\\nThe worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\\ndoing anything else.  At least that was the view that the men of his\\ngeneration had taken.  The trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\\nscope for the unforeseen.  There are moments when a man's imagination,\\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  Archer hung there and\\nwondered....\\n\\nWhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\\nstandards had bent and bound him?  He remembered a sneering prophecy of\\npoor Lawrence Lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room:  \\\"If\\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort's\\nbastards.\\\"\\n\\nIt was just what Archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  Even the boy's Aunt Janey, who still\\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\\nmother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\\nFanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\\n\\\"set\\\" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\\nIsabey miniature.\\n\\nFanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the\\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won\\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  She was pretty, amusing\\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  Nobody was narrow-minded\\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's\\npast and her own origin.  Only the older people remembered so obscure\\nan incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort's failure, or\\nthe fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the\\nnotorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  He was subsequently heard of in\\nConstantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American\\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he\\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  He and his wife died there in\\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\\nappeared in New York in charge of May Archer's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack\\nWelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian.  The\\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer's\\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when Dallas's engagement was\\nannounced.\\n\\nNothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\\nworld had travelled.  People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\\nand \\\"movements,\\\" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\\nabout their neighbours.  And of what account was anybody's past, in the\\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\\nplane?\\n\\nNewland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\\nof the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\\neagerness of youth.\\n\\nIt was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\\ntemples.  He wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in\\nthe presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not.  \\\"It\\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,\\\" he\\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\\napprove.\\n\\n\\\"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that\\nthey're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\\nit for granted that we shouldn't.  Only, I wonder--the thing one's so\\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\\\"\\n\\nIt was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine\\nheld Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\\nPlace Vendome.  One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris,\\nhe shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled \\\"palaces.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, all right--of course,\\\" Dallas good-naturedly agreed.  \\\"I'll take\\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the Bristol say--\\\" leaving his\\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\\n\\nArcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\\nscene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska's\\nlife.  Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  Now the spectacle\\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\\n\\nDallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  \\\"Hullo, father: this\\nis something like, isn't it?\\\"  They stood for a while looking out in\\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  \\\"By the way, I've got a\\nmessage for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past\\nfive.\\\"\\n\\nHe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\\nfor Florence the next evening.  Archer looked at him, and thought he\\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott's\\nmalice.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, didn't I tell you?\\\" Dallas pursued.  \\\"Fanny made me swear to do\\nthree things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last\\nDebussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska.  You\\nknow she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from\\nBuenos Ayres to the Assomption.  Fanny hadn't any friends in Paris, and\\nMadame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\\nI believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort's.  And\\nshe's our cousin, of course.  So I rang her up this morning, before I\\nwent out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to\\nsee her.\\\"\\n\\nArcher continued to stare at him.  \\\"You told her I was here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course--why not?\\\"  Dallas's eye brows went up whimsically.  Then,\\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a\\nconfidential pressure.\\n\\n\\\"I say, father: what was she like?\\\"\\n\\nArcher felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze.  \\\"Come, own\\nup: you and she were great pals, weren't you?  Wasn't she most awfully\\nlovely?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lovely?  I don't know.  She was different.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--there you have it!  That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?\\nWhen she comes, SHE'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn't know why.  It's\\nexactly what I feel about Fanny.\\\"\\n\\nHis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  \\\"About Fanny?  But, my\\ndear fellow--I should hope so!  Only I don't see--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dash it, Dad, don't be prehistoric!  Wasn't she--once--your Fanny?\\\"\\n\\nDallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  He was the\\nfirst-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to\\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  \\\"What's the use of\\nmaking mysteries?  It only makes people want to nose 'em out,\\\" he\\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  But Archer, meeting his\\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\\n\\n\\\"My Fanny?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,\\\"\\ncontinued his surprising son.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't,\\\" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity.\\n\\n\\\"No: you date, you see, dear old boy.  But mother said--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes: the day before she died.  It was when she sent for me alone--you\\nremember?  She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you\\nmost wanted.\\\"\\n\\nArcher received this strange communication in silence.  His eyes\\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\\nwindow.  At length he said in a low voice:  \\\"She never asked me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.  I forgot.  You never did ask each other anything, did you?  And\\nyou never told each other anything.  You just sat and watched each\\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  A deaf-and-dumb\\nasylum, in fact!  Well, I back your generation for knowing more about\\neach other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\\nour own.--I say, Dad,\\\" Dallas broke off, \\\"you're not angry with me?  If\\nyou are, let's make it up and go and lunch at Henri's.  I've got to\\nrush out to Versailles afterward.\\\"\\n\\nArcher did not accompany his son to Versailles.  He preferred to spend\\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris.  He had to deal all\\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\\nlifetime.\\n\\nAfter a little while he did not regret Dallas's indiscretion.  It\\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  And that it should have been his\\nwife moved him indescribably.  Dallas, for all his affectionate\\ninsight, would not have understood that.  To the boy, no doubt, the\\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\\nforces.  But was it really no more?  For a long time Archer sat on a\\nbench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\\nrolled by....\\n\\nA few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited.  She had\\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  There was nothing\\nnow to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\\n\\nHe got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries\\ngardens to the Louvre.  She had once told him that she often went\\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  For an hour\\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\\nbeauty.  After all, his life had been too starved....\\n\\nSuddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying:  \\\"But\\nI'm only fifty-seven--\\\" and then he turned away.  For such summer\\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\\n\\nHe went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and\\ntogether they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the\\nbridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies.\\n\\nDallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was\\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles.  He had had but one\\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\\nthe family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\\n\\nAs Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\\nincreased.  The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\\nmaster but as an equal.  \\\"That's it: they feel equal to things--they\\nknow their way about,\\\" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\\n\\nSuddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm.  \\\"Oh, by\\nJove,\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\nThey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\\nInvalides.  The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding\\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\\nof the race's glory.\\n\\nArcher knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the\\navenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\\nit up.  Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  For\\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  He thought of the\\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\\nFrenchman who had once said to him:  \\\"Ah, good conversation--there is\\nnothing like it, is there?\\\"\\n\\nArcher had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame\\nOlenska's existence.  More than half a lifetime divided them, and she\\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\\nunderstand.  During that time he had been living with his youthful\\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\\ncompanionship.  Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\\n\\nThey had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of\\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  It was a quiet quarter, after\\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\\nan idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\\n\\nThe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\\ninto which they had turned.  Dallas stopped again, and looked up.\\n\\n\\\"It must be here,\\\" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with\\na movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood\\ntogether looking up at the house.\\n\\nIt was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\\nfront.  On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder which floor--?\\\" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to\\nsay:  \\\"The fifth.  It must be the one with the awnings.\\\"\\n\\nArcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\\n\\n\\\"I say, you know, it's nearly six,\\\" his son at length reminded him.\\n\\nThe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I'll sit there a moment,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Why--aren't you well?\\\" his son exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, perfectly.  But I should like you, please, to go up without me.\\\"\\n\\nDallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  \\\"But, I say, Dad: do you\\nmean you won't come up at all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" said Archer slowly.\\n\\n\\\"If you don't she won't understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you.\\\"\\n\\nDallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\\n\\n\\\"But what on earth shall I say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?\\\" his father\\nrejoined with a smile.\\n\\n\\\"Very well.  I shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\\nthe five flights because you don't like lifts.\\\"\\n\\nHis father smiled again.  \\\"Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\\\"\\n\\nDallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\\n\\nArcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\\nbalcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas\\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\\n\\\"took after him.\\\"\\n\\nThen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be\\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\\non a table.\\n\\n\\\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\\\" he suddenly heard\\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\\nother.\\n\\nHe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\\nnever turning from the balcony.  At length a light shone through the\\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\\n\\nAt that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got\\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Note on the Text\\n\\nThe Age of Innocence first appeared in four large installments in The\\nPictorial Review, from July to October 1920.

Raina, a Bulgarian woman from a wealthy family, learns from her mother, Catherine, that the Bulgarian cavalry have won a battle against the Serbs. Catherine adds that Sergius, Raina\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9, was at the head of the charge, and was as heroic in life as he appears in the picture Raina keeps in her bedroom. Louka, their servant, enters and warns Catherine and Raina that escaped Serbs fleeing the battlefield might be in the area, seeking refuge in the houses of Bulgarian families. Raina is not worried, and chooses to keep her window unlocked. In the night, a man enters the room through the unlocked window and says he will kill Raina if she makes a noise. The man is Swiss and an escaped soldier, fighting as a mercenary for the Serbians.\\n\\nRaina is shocked to see that the man is tired and hungry, that he does not glorify battle, and that he is merely happy to have escaped the carnage alive. Raina helps him hide behind a curtain just as Catherine, Louka, and a Bulgarian officer enter to search the room for any Serbs who might be hiding in the area. Raina convinces them that no one is in her room, and they leave. Raina gives the man chocolate creams, which she keeps in a box in her room, and is shocked to hear that the man has no ammunition for his pistol, as he normally only keeps candies in his pockets. The man argues that Sergius\\u2019s cavalry charge against the Serbs was foolish, and succeeded only by sheer luck. The Serbs had machine guns but were given the wrong ammunition by accident, and therefore could not mow down Sergius and his men. Raina agrees to help the man escape later that night, though she rebukes him for making fun of her fianc\\u00e9 Sergius. The man sleeps as Raina enlists Catherine\\u2019s help, and when Raina and Catherine return, they allow the man to rest since he has not slept for days.\\n\\nThe second act begins in the garden of the same house, though it is now spring of 1886. Louka is engaged to the house\\u2019s head male servant, Nicola. Louka tells Nicola that he will never be more than a servant, and that she has higher aspirations. Louka tells him she knows many secrets about the Petkoff family, and Nicola says that he does, too, but would never blackmail his masters. Major Petkoff, the head of the family, returns from the war. He reports to Catherine that Sergius will never receive the military promotion Sergius craves, because Sergius has no command of military strategy. Sergius enters and is greeted warmly by the family, and especially by Raina, who still considers him a hero. Sergius says he has abandoned his commission in the army out of anger that he will never move up in the ranks. Sergius and Petkoff tell a story they heard about this Swiss soldier being hidden by two Bulgarian women during the soldier\\u2019s retreat. Catherine and Raina realize the story is about them, but do not say anything.\\n\\nSergius speaks with Louka in private, and begins flirting with her. Louka reveals to Sergius that Raina might not remain faithful to Sergius, and Sergius is taken aback. They exit. A man named Bluntschli enters the family garden and Louka brings him to Catherine. Catherine realizes that he is the man that hid in Raina\\u2019s room, the same man that she and Raina helped escape. Catherine worries that Sergius and Petkoff, who are conferring over military plans in the library, might encounter the soldier. Sergius and Petkoff have no idea that the story they heard about a soldier being helped by two Bulgarian women involves the Petkoffs. Bluntschli has come to return Major Petkoff\\u2019s coat that Catherine and Raina lent him to escape. Raina is so happy to see him that she blurts out, \\u201cthe chocolate cream soldier!\\u201d when she walks in the room, only to recover herself and blame her outburst, implausibly, on Nicola. Petkoff and Sergius, who have in fact already met Bluntschli during the war, ask Bluntschli to stay and pass the time.\\n\\nIn the final act, the various tensions of the play thus far are exposed. Louka tells Sergius that the man with whom Raina is in love is Bluntschli. Sergius challenges Bluntschli to a duel because of this, but Bluntschli explains his way out of it. A picture of herself that Raina placed in her father\\u2019s cloak for Bluntschli to find is exposed, proving that Raina has not been entirely truthful to Sergius. Raina admits that she has had feelings for Bluntschli since they first met. Major Petkoff is aghast. When Bluntschli acknowledges that he has loved Raina, Sergius and Louka reveal that they have been having a secret affair at Sergius\\u2019 instigation, and Nicola releases Louka from their engagement. Bluntschli, whose father has just died, has come into a great deal of money, so Raina\\u2019s parents are glad to marry her off to him and his handsome fortune. Raina is revealed to be 23 rather than 17, enabling Bluntschli in good conscience to ask for her hand in marriage. Bluntschli promises to hire Nicola, whom he admires, to run the hotels he has just received as part of his inheritance. Sergius accepts Louka as his lover in public, thus satisfying Louka\\u2019s desire to move up in the social ranks. The play ends with Sergius exclaiming, of Bluntschli, \\u201cWhat a man!\\u201d\",\n          \"She Stoops to Conquer; Or, The Mistakes of a Night: A Comedy\\\" by Oliver Goldsmith is a comedic play written during the late 18th century. The plot revolves around a series of misunderstandings and mistaken identities, particularly focusing on the interactions between the characters Young Marlow, who is shy around respectable women, and Miss Hardcastle, who finds herself in the midst of a confusing courtship. This comedy of errors also features a variety of humorous and eccentric characters, including the mischievous Tony Lumpkin, who complicates matters with his pranks. At the start of the play, we are introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Hardcastle, who discuss their son Tony and the arrival of a young gentleman, Mr. Marlow, whom they hope will be a suitable match for their daughter, Kate. However, it quickly becomes evident that Marlow's shyness with respectable women is a source of comedy as he approaches interactions awkwardly, unable to communicate properly. Meanwhile, Tony devises a scheme to trick his family and others, setting the stage for a night filled with humorous misunderstandings. As the characters navigate their relationships and the ensuing chaos, the play promises an entertaining exploration of social norms and romantic pursuits in a comedic light.\",\n          \"Winner of the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, The Age of Innocence is Edith Wharton\\u2019s masterful portrait of desire and betrayal during the sumptuous Golden Age of Old New York, a time when society people \\u201cdreaded scandal more than disease.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is Newland Archer\\u2019s world as he prepares to marry the beautiful but conventional May Welland.

something very amusing in the\\nattitude of the orthodox criticism toward bernard shaw. he so obviously\\ndisregards all the canons and unities and other things which every\\nwell-bred dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthy\\nof serious criticism (orthodox). indeed he knows no more about the\\ndramatic art than, according to his own story in \\\"the man of destiny,\\\"\\nnapoleon at tavazzano knew of the art of war. but both men were\\nsuccesses each in his way--the latter won victories and the former\\ngained audiences, in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war and\\nthe theatre. shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have his\\ncharacters make long speeches at one another, apparently thinking that\\nthis embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of\\nbombast and rhetoric. there never was an author who showed less\\npredilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results.\\nhe recognized, early in his days, many things awry in the world and he\\nassumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit. it\\nseems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright. he began as an\\nessayist, but who reads essays now-a-days?--he then turned novelist with\\nno better success, for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he\\nchose to emit. he only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men\\nand women--although he has created few of the latter--can be most\\nextremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking.\\n\\nas a last resort, he turned to the stage, not that he cared for the\\ndramatic art, for no man seems to care less about \\\"art for art's sake,\\\"\\nbeing in this a perfect foil to his brilliant compatriot and\\ncontemporary, wilde. he cast his theories in dramatic forms merely\\nbecause no other course except silence or physical revolt was open to\\nhim. for a long time it seemed as if this resource too was doomed to\\nfail him. but finally he has attained a hearing and now attempts at\\nsuppression merely serve to advertise their victim.\\n\\nit will repay those who seek analogies in literature to compare shaw\\nwith cervantes. after a life of heroic endeavor, disappointment,\\nslavery, and poverty, the author of \\\"don quixote\\\" gave the world a\\nserious work which caused to be laughed off the world's stage forever\\nthe final vestiges of decadent chivalry.\\n\\nthe institution had long been outgrown, but its vernacular continued to\\nbe the speech and to express the thought \\\"of the world and among the\\nvulgar,\\\" as the quaint, old novelist puts it, just as to-day the novel\\nintended for the consumption of the unenlightened must deal with peers\\nand millionaires and be dressed in stilted language. marvellously he\\nsucceeded, but in a way he least intended. we have not yet, after so\\nmany years, determined whether it is a work to laugh or cry over. \\\"it is\\nour joyfullest modern book,\\\" says carlyle, while landor thinks that\\n\\\"readers who see nothing more than a burlesque in 'don quixote' have but\\nshallow appreciation of the work.\\\"\\n\\nshaw in like manner comes upon the scene when many of our social usages\\nare outworn. he sees the fact, announces it, and we burst into guffaws.\\nthe continuous laughter which greets shaw's plays arises from a real\\ncontrast in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences. when\\npinero or jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a\\nmoment that the author's point of view is our own and that the abnormal\\npredicament of his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his\\naudience. with shaw this sense of community of feeling is wholly\\nlacking. he describes things as he sees them, and the house is in a\\nroar. who is right? if we were really using our own senses and not\\ngazing through the glasses of convention and romance and make-believe,\\nshould we see things as shaw does?\\n\\nmust it not cause shaw to doubt his own or the public's sanity to hear\\naudiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations? and yet, if they\\ndid not come to laugh, they would not come at all. mockery is the price\\nhe must pay for a hearing. or has he calculated to a nicety the power of\\nreaction? does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of\\nsordidness, to disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness, to\\nillusion by disillusionment? it is impossible to believe that he is\\nunconscious of the humor of his dramatic situations, yet he stoically\\ngives no sign. he even dares the charge, terrible in proportion to its\\ntruth, which the most serious of us shrinks from--the lack of a sense of\\nhumor. men would rather have their integrity impugned.\\n\\nin \\\"arms and the man\\\" the subject which occupies the dramatist's\\nattention is that survival of barbarity--militarism--which raises its\\nhorrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our\\ncivilization. no more hoary superstition survives than that the donning\\nof a uniform changes the nature of the wearer. this notion pervades\\nsociety to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon\\nthe stage acting rationally, our conventionalized senses are shocked.\\nthe only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently\\nbeen there, and, of course, mr. shaw, who has no illusions about\\nanything.\\n\\nit is hard to speak too highly of \\\"candida.\\\" no equally subtle and\\nincisive study of domestic relations exists in the english drama. one\\nhas to turn to george meredith's \\\"the egoist\\\" to find such character\\ndissection. the central note of the play is, that with the true woman,\\nweakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than\\nstrength which offers protection. candida is quite unpoetic, as, indeed,\\nwith rare exceptions, women are prone to be. they have small delight in\\npoetry, but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made. the\\nhusband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness, the poet\\npitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth,\\nthe hopelessly de-moralized manufacturer, the conventional and hence\\nemotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be\\nchallenged to rival.\\n\\nin \\\"the man of destiny\\\" the object of the dramatist is not so much the\\ndestruction as the explanation of the napoleonic tradition, which has so\\npowerfully influenced generation after generation for a century. however\\nthe man may be regarded, he was a miracle. shaw shows that he achieved\\nhis extraordinary career by suspending, for himself, the pressure of the\\nmoral and conventional atmosphere, while leaving it operative for\\nothers. those who study this play--extravaganza, that it is--will attain\\na clearer comprehension of napoleon than they can get from all the\\nbiographies.\\n\\n\\\"you never can tell\\\" offers an amusing study of the play of social\\nconventions. the \\\"twins\\\" illustrate the disconcerting effects of that\\nperfect frankness which would make life intolerable. gloria demonstrates\\nthe powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts. the idea that\\nparental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such\\nknowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned.\\ncrampton, the father, typifies the common superstition that among the\\nprivileges of parenthood are inflexibility, tyranny, and respect, the\\nlast entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved.\\n\\nthe waiter, william, is the best illustration of the man \\\"who knows his\\nplace\\\" that the stage has seen. he is the most pathetic figure of the\\nplay. one touch of verisimilitude is lacking; none of the guests gives\\nhim a tip, yet he maintains his urbanity. as mr. shaw has not yet\\nvisited america he may be unaware of the improbability of this\\nsituation.\\n\\nto those who regard literary men merely as purveyors of amusement for\\npeople who have not wit enough to entertain themselves, ibsen and shaw,\\nmaeterlinck and gorky must remain enigmas. it is so much pleasanter to\\nignore than to face unpleasant realities--to take riverside drive and\\nnot mulberry street as the exponent of our life and the expression of\\nour civilization. these men are the sappers and miners of the advancing\\narmy of justice. the audience which demands the truth and despises the\\ncontemptible conventions that dominate alike our stage and our life is\\ndaily growing. shaw and men like him--if indeed he is not absolutely\\nunique--will not for the future lack a hearing.\\n\\nm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\narms and the man. act i\\n\\n\\n\\n    night. a lady's bedchamber in bulgaria, in a small\\n    town near the dragoman pass. it is late in\\n    november in the year 1885, and through an open\\n    window with a little balcony on the left can be\\n    seen a peak of the balkans, wonderfully white and\\n    beautiful in the starlit snow. the interior of the\\n    room is not like anything to be seen in the east\\n    of europe. it is half rich bulgarian, half cheap\\n    viennese. the counterpane and hangings of the bed,\\n    the window curtains, the little carpet, and all\\n    the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are\\n    oriental and gorgeous: the paper on the walls is\\n    occidental and paltry. above the head of the bed,\\n    which stands against a little wall cutting off the\\n    right hand corner of the room diagonally, is a\\n    painted wooden shrine, blue and gold, with an\\n    ivory image of christ, and a light hanging before\\n    it in a pierced metal ball suspended by three\\n    chains. on the left, further forward, is an\\n    ottoman. the washstand, against the wall on the\\n    left, consists of an enamelled iron basin with a\\n    pail beneath it in a painted metal frame, and a\\n    single towel on the rail at the side. a chair near\\n    it is austrian bent wood, with cane seat. the\\n    dressing table, between the bed and the window, is\\n    an ordinary pine table, covered with a cloth of\\n    many colors, but with an expensive toilet mirror\\n    on it. the door is on the right; and there is a\\n    chest of drawers between the door and the bed.\\n    this chest of drawers is also covered by a\\n    variegated native cloth, and on it there is a pile\\n    of paper backed novels, a box of chocolate creams,\\n    and a miniature easel, on which is a large\\n    photograph of an extremely handsome officer, whose\\n    lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even\\n    from the portrait. the room is lighted by a candle\\n    on the chest of drawers, and another on the\\n    dressing table, with a box of matches beside it.\\n\\n    the window is hinged doorwise and stands wide\\n    open, folding back to the left. outside a pair of\\n    wooden shutters, opening outwards, also stand\\n    open. on the balcony, a young lady, intensely\\n    conscious of the romantic beauty of the night, and\\n    of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part\\n    of it, is on the balcony, gazing at the snowy\\n    balkans. she is covered by a long mantle of furs,\\n    worth, on a moderate estimate, about three times\\n    the furniture of her room.\\n\\n    her reverie is interrupted by her mother,\\n    catherine petkoff, a woman over forty, imperiously\\n    energetic, with magnificent black hair and eyes,\\n    who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife\\n    of a mountain farmer, but is determined to be a\\n    viennese lady, and to that end wears a fashionable\\n    tea gown on all occasions.\\n\\ncatherine (entering hastily, full of good news). raina--(she\\npronounces it rah-eena, with the stress on the ee) raina--(she\\ngoes to the bed, expecting to find raina there.) why,\\nwhere--(raina looks into the room.) heavens! child, are you out\\nin the night air instead of in your bed? you'll catch your\\ndeath. louka told me you were asleep.\\n\\nraina (coming in). i sent her away. i wanted to be alone. the\\nstars are so beautiful! what is the matter?\\n\\ncatherine. such news. there has been a battle!\\n\\nraina (her eyes dilating). ah! (she throws the cloak on the\\nottoman, and comes eagerly to catherine in her nightgown, a\\npretty garment, but evidently the only one she has on.)\\n\\ncatherine. a great battle at slivnitza! a victory! and it was\\nwon by sergius.\\n\\nraina (with a cry of delight). ah! (rapturously.) oh, mother!\\n(then, with sudden anxiety) is father safe?\\n\\ncatherine. of course: he sent me the news. sergius is the hero\\nof the hour, the idol of the regiment.\\n\\nraina. tell me, tell me. how was it! (ecstatically) oh, mother,\\nmother, mother! (raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and\\nthey kiss one another frantically.)\\n\\ncatherine (with surging enthusiasm). you can't guess how\\nsplendid it is. a cavalry charge--think of that! he defied our\\nrussian commanders--acted without orders--led a charge on his\\nown responsibility--headed it himself--was the first man to\\nsweep through their guns. can't you see it, raina; our gallant\\nsplendid bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing,\\nthundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched\\nservian dandies like chaff. and you--you kept sergius waiting a\\nyear before you would be betrothed to him. oh, if you have a\\ndrop of bulgarian blood in your veins, you will worship him when\\nhe comes back.\\n\\nraina. what will he care for my poor little worship after the\\nacclamations of a whole army of heroes? but no matter: i am so\\nhappy--so proud! (she rises and walks about excitedly.) it\\nproves that all our ideas were real after all.\\n\\ncatherine (indignantly). our ideas real! what do you mean?\\n\\nraina. our ideas of what sergius would do--our patriotism--our\\nheroic ideals. oh, what faithless little creatures girls are!--i\\nsometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams.\\nwhen i buckled on sergius's sword he looked so noble: it was\\ntreason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure. and\\nyet--and yet--(quickly.) promise me you'll never tell him.\\n\\ncatherine. don't ask me for promises until i know what i am\\npromising.\\n\\nraina. well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in\\nhis arms and looking into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our\\nheroic ideas because we are so fond of reading byron and\\npushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera that\\nseason at bucharest. real life is so seldom like that--indeed\\nnever, as far as i knew it then. (remorsefully.) only think,\\nmother, i doubted him: i wondered whether all his heroic\\nqualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination\\nwhen he went into a real battle. i had an uneasy fear that he\\nmight cut a poor figure there beside all those clever russian\\nofficers.\\n\\ncatherine. a poor figure! shame on you! the servians have\\naustrian officers who are just as clever as our russians; but we\\nhave beaten them in every battle for all that.\\n\\nraina (laughing and sitting down again). yes, i was only a\\nprosaic little coward. oh, to think that it was all true--that\\nsergius is just as splendid and noble as he looks--that the\\nworld is really a glorious world for women who can see its glory\\nand men who can act its romance! what happiness! what\\nunspeakable fulfilment! ah! (she throws herself on her knees\\nbeside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her.\\nthey are interrupted by the entry of louka, a handsome, proud\\ngirl in a pretty bulgarian peasant's dress with double apron, so\\ndefiant that her servility to raina is almost insolent. she is\\nafraid of catherine, but even with her goes as far as she dares.\\nshe is just now excited like the others; but she has no sympathy\\nfor raina's raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies\\nof the two before she addresses them.)\\n\\nlouka. if you please, madam, all the windows are to be closed\\nand the shutters made fast. they say there may be shooting in\\nthe streets. (raina and catherine rise together, alarmed.) the\\nservians are being chased right back through the pass; and they\\nsay they may run into the town. our cavalry will be after them;\\nand our people will be ready for them you may be sure, now that\\nthey are running away. (she goes out on the balcony and pulls\\nthe outside shutters to; then steps back into the room.)\\n\\nraina. i wish our people were not so cruel. what glory is there\\nin killing wretched fugitives?\\n\\ncatherine (business-like, her housekeeping instincts aroused).\\ni must see that everything is made safe downstairs.\\n\\nraina (to louka). leave the shutters so that i can just close\\nthem if i hear any noise.\\n\\ncatherine (authoritatively, turning on her way to the door).\\noh, no, dear, you must keep them fastened. you would be sure to\\ndrop off to sleep and leave them open. make them fast, louka.\\n\\nlouka. yes, madam. (she fastens them.)\\n\\nraina. don't be anxious about me. the moment i hear a shot, i\\nshall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my\\nears well covered.\\n\\ncatherine. quite the wisest thing you can do, my love.\\ngood-night.\\n\\nraina. good-night. (they kiss one another, and raina's emotion\\ncomes back for a moment.) wish me joy of the happiest night of\\nmy life--if only there are no fugitives.\\n\\ncatherine. go to bed, dear; and don't think of them. (she goes\\nout.)\\n\\nlouka (secretly, to raina). if you would like the shutters\\nopen, just give them a push like this. (she pushes them: they\\nopen: she pulls them to again.) one of them ought to be bolted\\nat the bottom; but the bolt's gone.\\n\\nraina (with dignity, reproving her). thanks, louka; but we must\\ndo what we are told. (louka makes a grimace.) good-night.\\n\\nlouka (carelessly). good-night. (she goes out, swaggering.)\\n\\n   (raina, left alone, goes to the chest of drawers,\\n    and adores the portrait there with feelings that\\n    are beyond all expression. she does not kiss it or\\n    press it to her breast, or shew it any mark of\\n    bodily affection; but she takes it in her hands\\n    and elevates it like a priestess.)\\n\\nraina (looking up at the picture with worship.) oh, i shall\\nnever be unworthy of you any more, my hero--never, never, never.\\n\\n    (she replaces it reverently, and selects a novel\\n    from the little pile of books. she turns over the\\n    leaves dreamily; finds her page; turns the book\\n    inside out at it; and then, with a happy sigh,\\n    gets into bed and prepares to read herself to\\n    sleep. but before abandoning herself to fiction,\\n    she raises her eyes once more, thinking of the\\n    blessed reality and murmurs)\\n\\nmy hero! my hero!\\n\\n    (a distant shot breaks the quiet of the night\\n    outside. she starts, listening; and two more\\n    shots, much nearer, follow, startling her so that\\n    she scrambles out of bed, and hastily blows out\\n    the candle on the chest of drawers. then, putting\\n    her fingers in her ears, she runs to the\\n    dressing-table and blows out the light there, and\\n    hurries back to bed. the room is now in darkness:\\n    nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in\\n    the pierced ball before the image, and the\\n    starlight seen through the slits at the top of the\\n    shutters. the firing breaks out again: there is a\\n    startling fusillade quite close at hand. whilst it\\n    is still echoing, the shutters disappear, pulled\\n    open from without, and for an instant the\\n    rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the\\n    figure of a man in black upon it. the shutters\\n    close immediately and the room is dark again. but\\n    the silence is now broken by the sound of panting.\\n    then there is a scrape; and the flame of a match\\n    is seen in the middle of the room.)\\n\\nraina (crouching on the bed). who's there? (the match is out\\ninstantly.) who's there? who is that?\\n\\na man's voice (in the darkness, subduedly, but threateningly).\\nsh--sh! don't call out or you'll be shot. be good; and no harm\\nwill happen to you. (she is heard leaving her bed, and making\\nfor the door.) take care, there's no use in trying to run away.\\nremember, if you raise your voice my pistol will go off.\\n(commandingly.) strike a light and let me see you. do you hear?\\n(another moment of silence and darkness. then she is heard\\nretreating to the dressing-table. she lights a candle, and the\\nmystery is at an end. a man of about 35, in a deplorable plight,\\nbespattered with mud and blood and snow, his belt and the strap\\nof his revolver case keeping together the torn ruins of the blue\\ncoat of a servian artillery officer. as far as the candlelight\\nand his unwashed, unkempt condition make it possible to judge,\\nhe is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance,\\nwith strong neck and shoulders, a roundish, obstinate looking\\nhead covered with short crisp bronze curls, clear quick blue\\neyes and good brows and mouth, a hopelessly prosaic nose like\\nthat of a strong-minded baby, trim soldierlike carriage and\\nenergetic manner, and with all his wits about him in spite of\\nhis desperate predicament--even with a sense of humor of it,\\nwithout, however, the least intention of trifling with it or\\nthrowing away a chance. he reckons up what he can guess about\\nraina--her age, her social position, her character, the extent\\nto which she is frightened--at a glance, and continues, more\\npolitely but still most determinedly) excuse my disturbing you;\\nbut you recognise my uniform--servian. if i'm caught i shall be\\nkilled. (determinedly.) do you understand that?\\n\\nraina. yes.\\n\\nman. well, i don't intend to get killed if i can help it. (still\\nmore determinedly.) do you understand that? (he locks the door\\nwith a snap.)\\n\\nraina (disdainfully). i suppose not. (she draws herself up\\nsuperbly, and looks him straight in the face, saying with\\nemphasis) some soldiers, i know, are afraid of death.\\n\\nman (with grim goodhumor). all of them, dear lady, all of them,\\nbelieve me. it is our duty to live as long as we can, and kill\\nas many of the enemy as we can. now if you raise an alarm--\\n\\nraina (cutting him short). you will shoot me. how do you know\\nthat i am afraid to die?\\n\\nman (cunningly). ah; but suppose i don't shoot you, what will\\nhappen then? why, a lot of your cavalry--the greatest\\nblackguards in your army--will burst into this pretty room of\\nyours and slaughter me here like a pig; for i'll fight like a\\ndemon: they shan't get me into the street to amuse themselves\\nwith: i know what they are. are you prepared to receive that\\nsort of company in your present undress? (raina, suddenly\\nconscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it\\nmore closely about her. he watches her, and adds, pitilessly)\\nit's rather scanty, eh? (she turns to the ottoman. he raises his\\npistol instantly, and cries) stop! (she stops.) where are you\\ngoing?\\n\\nraina (with dignified patience). only to get my cloak.\\n\\nman (darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak). a good\\nidea. no: i'll keep the cloak: and you will take care that\\nnobody comes in and sees you without it. this is a better weapon\\nthan the pistol. (he throws the pistol down on the ottoman.)\\n\\nraina (revolted). it is not the weapon of a gentleman!\\n\\nman. it's good enough for a man with only you to stand between\\nhim and death. (as they look at one another for a moment, raina\\nhardly able to believe that even a servian officer can be so\\ncynically and selfishly unchivalrous, they are startled by a\\nsharp fusillade in the street. the chill of imminent death\\nhushes the man's voice as he adds) do you hear? if you are going\\nto bring those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you\\nare. (raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn. suddenly he\\nstarts, listening. there is a step outside. someone tries the\\ndoor, and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it. raina looks\\nat the man, breathless. he throws up his head with the gesture\\nof a man who sees that it is all over with him, and, dropping\\nthe manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her, flings\\nthe cloak to her, exclaiming, sincerely and kindly) no use: i'm\\ndone for. quick! wrap yourself up: they're coming!\\n\\nraina (catching the cloak eagerly). oh, thank you. (she wraps\\nherself up with great relief. he draws his sabre and turns to\\nthe door, waiting.)\\n\\nlouka (outside, knocking). my lady, my lady! get up, quick, and\\nopen the door.\\n\\nraina (anxiously). what will you do?\\n\\nman (grimly). never mind. keep out of the way. it will not last\\nlong.\\n\\nraina (impulsively). i'll help you. hide yourself, oh, hide\\nyourself, quick, behind the curtain. (she seizes him by a torn\\nstrip of his sleeve, and pulls him towards the window.)\\n\\nman (yielding to her). there is just half a chance, if you keep\\nyour head. remember: nine soldiers out of ten are born fools.\\n(he hides behind the curtain, looking out for a moment to say,\\nfinally) if they find me, i promise you a fight--a devil of a\\nfight! (he disappears. raina takes off the cloak and throws it\\nacross the foot of the bed. then with a sleepy, disturbed air,\\nshe opens the door. louka enters excitedly.)\\n\\nlouka. a man has been seen climbing up the water-pipe to your\\nbalcony--a servian. the soldiers want to search for him; and\\nthey are so wild and drunk and furious. my lady says you are to\\ndress at once.\\n\\nraina (as if annoyed at being disturbed). they shall not search\\nhere. why have they been let in?\\n\\ncatherine (coming in hastily). raina, darling, are you safe?\\nhave you seen anyone or heard anything?\\n\\nraina. i heard the shooting. surely the soldiers will not dare\\ncome in here?\\n\\ncatherine. i have found a russian officer, thank heaven: he\\nknows sergius. (speaking through the door to someone outside.)\\nsir, will you come in now! my daughter is ready.\\n\\n    (a young russian officer, in bulgarian uniform,\\n     enters, sword in hand.)\\n\\nthe officer. (with soft, feline politeness and stiff military\\ncarriage). good evening, gracious lady; i am sorry to intrude,\\nbut there is a fugitive hiding on the balcony. will you and the\\ngracious lady your mother please to withdraw whilst we search?\\n\\nraina (petulantly). nonsense, sir, you can see that there is no\\none on the balcony. (she throws the shutters wide open and\\nstands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden,\\npointing to the moonlit balcony. a couple of shots are fired\\nright under the window, and a bullet shatters the glass opposite\\nraina, who winks and gasps, but stands her ground, whilst\\ncatherine screams, and the officer rushes to the balcony.)\\n\\nthe officer. (on the balcony, shouting savagely down to the\\nstreet). cease firing there, you fools: do you hear? cease\\nfiring, damn you. (he glares down for a moment; then turns to\\nraina, trying to resume his polite manner.) could anyone have\\ngot in without your knowledge? were you asleep?\\n\\nraina. no, i have not been to bed.\\n\\nthe officer. (impatiently, coming back into the room). your\\nneighbours have their heads so full of runaway servians that\\nthey see them everywhere. (politely.) gracious lady, a thousand\\npardons. good-night. (military bow, which raina returns coldly.\\nanother to catherine, who follows him out. raina closes the\\nshutters. she turns and sees louka, who has been watching the\\nscene curiously.)\\n\\nraina. don't leave my mother, louka, whilst the soldiers are\\nhere. (louka glances at raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain;\\nthen purses her lips secretively, laughs to herself, and goes\\nout. raina follows her to the door, shuts it behind her with a\\nslam, and locks it violently. the man immediately steps out from\\nbehind the curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the\\ndanger from his mind in a businesslike way.)\\n\\nman. a narrow shave; but a miss is as good as a mile. dear young\\nlady, your servant until death. i wish for your sake i had\\njoined the bulgarian army instead of the servian. i am not a\\nnative servian.\\n\\nraina (haughtily). no, you are one of the austrians who set the\\nservians on to rob us of our national liberty, and who officer\\ntheir army for them. we hate them!\\n\\nman. austrian! not i. don't hate me, dear young lady. i am only\\na swiss, fighting merely as a professional soldier. i joined\\nservia because it was nearest to me. be generous: you've beaten\\nus hollow.\\n\\nraina. have i not been generous?\\n\\nman. noble!--heroic! but i'm not saved yet. this particular rush\\nwill soon pass through; but the pursuit will go on all night by\\nfits and starts. i must take my chance to get off during a quiet\\ninterval. you don't mind my waiting just a minute or two, do\\nyou?\\n\\nraina. oh, no: i am sorry you will have to go into danger again.\\n(motioning towards ottoman.) won't you sit--(she breaks off\\nwith an irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the\\npistol. the man, all nerves, shies like a frightened horse.)\\n\\nman (irritably). don't frighten me like that. what is it?\\n\\nraina. your pistol! it was staring that officer in the face all\\nthe time. what an escape!\\n\\nman (vexed at being unnecessarily terrified). oh, is that all?\\n\\nraina (staring at him rather superciliously, conceiving a\\npoorer and poorer opinion of him, and feeling proportionately\\nmore and more at her ease with him). i am sorry i frightened\\nyou. (she takes up the pistol and hands it to him.) pray take it\\nto protect yourself against me.\\n\\nman (grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol).\\nno use, dear young lady: there's nothing in it. it's not loaded.\\n(he makes a grimace at it, and drops it disparagingly into his\\nrevolver case.)\\n\\nraina. load it by all means.\\n\\nman. i've no ammunition. what use are cartridges in battle? i\\nalways carry chocolate instead; and i finished the last cake of\\nthat yesterday.\\n\\nraina (outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood).\\nchocolate! do you stuff your pockets with sweets--like a\\nschoolboy--even in the field?\\n\\nman. yes. isn't it contemptible?\\n\\n   (raina stares at him, unable to utter her\\n    feelings. then she sails away scornfully to the\\n    chest of drawers, and returns with the box of\\n    confectionery in her hand.)\\n\\nraina. allow me. i am sorry i have eaten them all except these.\\n(she offers him the box.)\\n\\nman (ravenously). you're an angel! (he gobbles the comfits.)\\ncreams! delicious! (he looks anxiously to see whether there are\\nany more. there are none. he accepts the inevitable with\\npathetic goodhumor, and says, with grateful emotion) bless you,\\ndear lady. you can always tell an old soldier by the inside of\\nhis holsters and cartridge boxes. the young ones carry pistols\\nand cartridges; the old ones, grub. thank you. (he hands back\\nthe box. she snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it\\naway. this impatient action is so sudden that he shies again.)\\nugh! don't do things so suddenly, gracious lady. don't revenge\\nyourself because i frightened you just now.\\n\\nraina (superbly). frighten me! do you know, sir, that though i\\nam only a woman, i think i am at heart as brave as you.\\n\\nman. i should think so. you haven't been under fire for three\\ndays as i have. i can stand two days without shewing it much;\\nbut no man can stand three days: i'm as nervous as a mouse. (he\\nsits down on the ottoman, and takes his head in his hands.)\\nwould you like to see me cry?\\n\\nraina (quickly). no.\\n\\nman. if you would, all you have to do is to scold me just as if\\ni were a little boy and you my nurse. if i were in camp now\\nthey'd play all sorts of tricks on me.\\n\\nraina (a little moved). i'm sorry. i won't scold you. (touched\\nby the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks\\ngratefully at her: she immediately draws back and says stiffly)\\nyou must excuse me: our soldiers are not like that. (she moves\\naway from the ottoman.)\\n\\nman. oh, yes, they are. there are only two sorts of soldiers:\\nold ones and young ones. i've served fourteen years: half of\\nyour fellows never smelt powder before. why, how is it that\\nyou've just beaten us? sheer ignorance of the art of war,\\nnothing else. (indignantly.) i never saw anything so\\nunprofessional.\\n\\nraina (ironically). oh, was it unprofessional to beat you?\\n\\nman. well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of\\ncavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty\\nthat if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within\\nfifty yards of the fire? i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw\\nit.\\n\\nraina (eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her\\ndream of glory rush back on her). did you see the great cavalry\\ncharge? oh, tell me about it. describe it to me.\\n\\nman. you never saw a cavalry charge, did you?\\n\\nraina. how could i?\\n\\nman. ah, perhaps not--of course. well, it's a funny sight. it's\\nlike slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one\\ncomes; then two or three close behind him; and then all the rest\\nin a lump.\\n\\nraina (her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands\\necstatically). yes, first one!--the bravest of the brave!\\n\\nman (prosaically). hm! you should see the poor devil pulling at\\nhis horse.\\n\\nraina. why should he pull at his horse?\\n\\nman (impatient of so stupid a question). it's running away with\\nhim, of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there\\nbefore the others and be killed? then they all come. you can\\ntell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing. the\\nold ones come bunched up under the number one guard: they know\\nthat they are mere projectiles, and that it's no use trying to\\nfight. the wounds are mostly broken knees, from the horses\\ncannoning together.\\n\\nraina. ugh! but i don't believe the first man is a coward. i\\nbelieve he is a hero!\\n\\nman (goodhumoredly). that's what you'd have said if you'd seen\\nthe first man in the charge to-day.\\n\\nraina (breathless). ah, i knew it! tell me--tell me about him.\\n\\nman. he did it like an operatic tenor--a regular handsome\\nfellow, with flashing eyes and lovely moustache, shouting a\\nwar-cry and charging like don quixote at the windmills. we\\nnearly burst with laughter at him; but when the sergeant ran up\\nas white as a sheet, and told us they'd sent us the wrong\\ncartridges, and that we couldn't fire a shot for the next ten\\nminutes, we laughed at the other side of our mouths. i never\\nfelt so sick in my life, though i've been in one or two very\\ntight places. and i hadn't even a revolver cartridge--nothing\\nbut chocolate. we'd no bayonets--nothing. of course, they just\\ncut us to bits. and there was don quixote flourishing like a\\ndrum major, thinking he'd done the cleverest thing ever known,\\nwhereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it. of all the fools\\never let loose on a field of battle, that man must be the very\\nmaddest. he and his regiment simply committed suicide--only the\\npistol missed fire, that's all.\\n\\nraina (deeply wounded, but steadfastly loyal to her ideals).\\nindeed! would you know him again if you saw him?\\n\\nman. shall i ever forget him. (she again goes to the chest of\\ndrawers. he watches her with a vague hope that she may have\\nsomething else for him to eat. she takes the portrait from its\\nstand and brings it to him.)\\n\\nraina. that is a photograph of the gentleman--the patriot and\\nhero--to whom i am betrothed.\\n\\nman (looking at it). i'm really very sorry. (looking at her.)\\nwas it fair to lead me on? (he looks at the portrait again.)\\nyes: that's him: not a doubt of it. (he stifles a laugh.)\\n\\nraina (quickly). why do you laugh?\\n\\nman (shamefacedly, but still greatly tickled). i didn't laugh,\\ni assure you. at least i didn't mean to. but when i think of him\\ncharging the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest\\nthing--(chokes with suppressed laughter).\\n\\nraina (sternly). give me back the portrait, sir.\\n\\nman (with sincere remorse). of course. certainly. i'm really\\nvery sorry. (she deliberately kisses it, and looks him straight\\nin the face, before returning to the chest of drawers to replace\\nit. he follows her, apologizing.) perhaps i'm quite wrong, you\\nknow: no doubt i am. most likely he had got wind of the\\ncartridge business somehow, and knew it was a safe job.\\n\\nraina. that is to say, he was a pretender and a coward! you did\\nnot dare say that before.\\n\\nman (with a comic gesture of despair). it's no use, dear lady:\\ni can't make you see it from the professional point of view. (as\\nhe turns away to get back to the ottoman, the firing begins\\nagain in the distance.)\\n\\nraina (sternly, as she sees him listening to the shots). so\\nmuch the better for you.\\n\\nman (turning). how?\\n\\nraina. you are my enemy; and you are at my mercy. what would i\\ndo if i were a professional soldier?\\n\\nman. ah, true, dear young lady: you're always right. i know how\\ngood you have been to me: to my last hour i shall remember those\\nthree chocolate creams. it was unsoldierly; but it was angelic.\\n\\nraina (coldly). thank you. and now i will do a soldierly thing.\\nyou cannot stay here after what you have just said about my\\nfuture husband; but i will go out on the balcony and see whether\\nit is safe for you to climb down into the street. (she turns to\\nthe window.)\\n\\nman (changing countenance). down that waterpipe! stop! wait! i\\ncan't! i daren't! the very thought of it makes me giddy. i came\\nup it fast enough with death behind me. but to face it now in\\ncold blood!--(he sinks on the ottoman.) it's no use: i give up:\\ni'm beaten. give the alarm. (he drops his head in his hands in\\nthe deepest dejection.)\\n\\nraina (disarmed by pity). come, don't be disheartened. (she\\nstoops over him almost maternally: he shakes his head.) oh, you\\nare a very poor soldier--a chocolate cream soldier. come, cheer\\nup: it takes less courage to climb down than to face\\ncapture--remember that.\\n\\nman (dreamily, lulled by her voice). no, capture only means\\ndeath; and death is sleep--oh, sleep, sleep, sleep, undisturbed\\nsleep! climbing down the pipe means doing something--exerting\\nmyself--thinking! death ten times over first.\\n\\nraina (softly and wonderingly, catching the rhythm of his\\nweariness). are you so sleepy as that?\\n\\nman. i've not had two hours' undisturbed sleep since the war\\nbegan. i'm on the staff: you don't know what that means. i\\nhaven't closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.\\n\\nraina (desperately). but what am i to do with you.\\n\\nman (staggering up). of course i must do something. (he shakes\\nhimself; pulls himself together; and speaks with rallied vigour\\nand courage.) you see, sleep or no sleep, hunger or no hunger,\\ntired or not tired, you can always do a thing when you know it\\nmust be done. well, that pipe must be got down--(he hits himself\\non the chest, and adds)--do you hear that, you chocolate cream\\nsoldier? (he turns to the window.)\\n\\nraina (anxiously). but if you fall?\\n\\nman. i shall sleep as if the stones were a feather bed.\\ngood-bye. (he makes boldly for the window, and his hand is on\\nthe shutter when there is a terrible burst of firing in the\\nstreet beneath.)\\n\\nraina (rushing to him). stop! (she catches him by the shoulder,\\nand turns him quite round.) they'll kill you.\\n\\nman (coolly, but attentively). never mind: this sort of thing\\nis all in my day's work. i'm bound to take my chance.\\n(decisively.) now do what i tell you. put out the candles, so\\nthat they shan't see the light when i open the shutters. and\\nkeep away from the window, whatever you do. if they see me,\\nthey're sure to have a shot at me.\\n\\nraina (clinging to him). they're sure to see you: it's bright\\nmoonlight. i'll save you--oh, how can you be so indifferent? you\\nwant me to save you, don't you?\\n\\nman. i really don't want to be troublesome. (she shakes him in\\nher impatience.) i am not indifferent, dear young lady, i assure\\nyou. but how is it to be done?\\n\\nraina. come away from the window--please. (she coaxes him back\\nto the middle of the room. he submits humbly. she releases him,\\nand addresses him patronizingly.) now listen. you must trust to\\nour hospitality. you do not yet know in whose house you are. i\\nam a petkoff.\\n\\nman. what's that?\\n\\nraina (rather indignantly). i mean that i belong to the family\\nof the petkoffs, the richest and best known in our country.\\n\\nman. oh, yes, of course. i beg your pardon. the petkoffs, to be\\nsure. how stupid of me!\\n\\nraina. you know you never heard of them until this minute. how\\ncan you stoop to pretend?\\n\\nman. forgive me: i'm too tired to think; and the change of\\nsubject was too much for me. don't scold me.\\n\\nraina. i forgot. it might make you cry. (he nods, quite\\nseriously. she pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone.) i\\nmust tell you that my father holds the highest command of any\\nbulgarian in our army. he is (proudly) a major.\\n\\nman (pretending to be deeply impressed). a major! bless me!\\nthink of that!\\n\\nraina. you shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was\\nnecessary to climb up to the balcony, because ours is the only\\nprivate house that has two rows of windows. there is a flight of\\nstairs inside to get up and down by.\\n\\nman. stairs! how grand! you live in great luxury indeed, dear\\nyoung lady.\\n\\nraina. do you know what a library is?\\n\\nman. a library? a roomful of books.\\n\\nraina. yes, we have one, the only one in bulgaria.\\n\\nman. actually a real library! i should like to see that.\\n\\nraina (affectedly). i tell you these things to shew you that\\nyou are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill\\nyou the moment they saw your servian uniform, but among\\ncivilized people. we go to bucharest every year for the opera\\nseason; and i have spent a whole month in vienna.\\n\\nman. i saw that, dear young lady. i saw at once that you knew\\nthe world.\\n\\nraina. have you ever seen the opera of ernani?\\n\\nman. is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet, and a\\nsoldier's chorus?\\n\\nraina (contemptuously). no!\\n\\nman (stifling a heavy sigh of weariness). then i don't know it.\\n\\nraina. i thought you might have remembered the great scene where\\nernani, flying from his foes just as you are tonight, takes\\nrefuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy, an old castilian\\nnoble. the noble refuses to give him up. his guest is sacred to\\nhim.\\n\\nman (quickly waking up a little). have your people got that\\nnotion?\\n\\nraina (with dignity). my mother and i can understand that\\nnotion, as you call it. and if instead of threatening me with\\nyour pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a\\nfugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as safe as in\\nyour father's house.\\n\\nman. quite sure?\\n\\nraina (turning her back on him in disgust.) oh, it is useless\\nto try and make you understand.\\n\\nman. don't be angry: you see how awkward it would be for me if\\nthere was any mistake. my father is a very hospitable man: he\\nkeeps six hotels; but i couldn't trust him as far as that. what\\nabout your father?\\n\\nraina. he is away at slivnitza fighting for his country. i\\nanswer for your safety. there is my hand in pledge of it. will\\nthat reassure you? (she offers him her hand.)\\n\\nman (looking dubiously at his own hand). better not touch my\\nhand, dear young lady. i must have a wash first.\\n\\nraina (touched). that is very nice of you. i see that you are a\\ngentleman.\\n\\nman (puzzled). eh?\\n\\nraina. you must not think i am surprised. bulgarians of really\\ngood standing--people in our position--wash their hands nearly\\nevery day. but i appreciate your delicacy. you may take my hand.\\n(she offers it again.)\\n\\nman (kissing it with his hands behind his back). thanks,\\ngracious young lady: i feel safe at last. and now would you mind\\nbreaking the news to your mother? i had better not stay here\\nsecretly longer than is necessary.\\n\\nraina. if you will be so good as to keep perfectly still whilst\\ni am away.\\n\\nman. certainly. (he sits down on the ottoman.)\\n\\n   (raina goes to the bed and wraps herself in the\\n    fur cloak. his eyes close. she goes to the door,\\n    but on turning for a last look at him, sees that\\n    he is dropping of to sleep.)\\n\\nraina (at the door). you are not going asleep, are you?\\n(he murmurs inarticulately: she runs to him and shakes him.)\\ndo you hear? wake up: you are falling asleep.\\n\\nman. eh? falling aslee--? oh, no, not the least in\\nthe world: i was only thinking. it's all right: i'm wide\\nawake.\\n\\nraina (severely). will you please stand up while i am\\naway. (he rises reluctantly.) all the time, mind.\\n\\nman (standing unsteadily). certainly--certainly: you\\nmay depend on me.\\n\\n    (raina looks doubtfully at him. he smiles\\n     foolishly. she goes reluctantly, turning\\n     again at the door, and almost catching him\\n     in the act of yawning. she goes out.)\\n\\nman (drowsily). sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, slee--(the\\nwords trail off into a murmur. he wakes again with a\\nshock on the point of falling.) where am i? that's what\\ni want to know: where am i? must keep awake. nothing\\nkeeps me awake except danger--remember that--(intently)\\ndanger, danger, danger, dan-- where's danger? must\\nfind it. (he starts of vaguely around the room in search of\\nit.) what am i looking for? sleep--danger--don't know.\\n(he stumbles against the bed.) ah, yes: now i know. all\\nright now. i'm to go to bed, but not to sleep--be sure\\nnot to sleep--because of danger. not to lie down, either,\\nonly sit down. (he sits on the bed. a blissful expression\\ncomes into his face.) ah! (with a happy sigh he sinks back\\nat full length; lifts his boots into the bed with a final\\neffort; and falls fast asleep instantly.)\\n\\n    (catherine comes in, followed by raina.)\\n\\nraina (looking at the ottoman). he's gone! i left him\\nhere.\\n\\ncatherine, here! then he must have climbed down from the--\\n\\nraina (seeing him). oh! (she points.)\\n\\ncatherine (scandalized). well! (she strides to the left\\nside of the bed, raina following and standing opposite her on\\nthe right.) he's fast asleep. the brute!\\n\\nraina (anxiously). sh!\\n\\ncatherine (shaking him). sir! (shaking him again,\\nharder.) sir!! (vehemently shaking very bard.) sir!!!\\n\\nraina (catching her arm). don't, mamma: the poor dear\\nis worn out. let him sleep.\\n\\ncatherine (letting him go and turning amazed to raina).\\nthe poor dear! raina!!! (she looks sternly at her\\ndaughter. the man sleeps profoundly.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nact ii\\n\\n\\n    the sixth of march, 1886. in the garden of major\\n    petkoff's house. it is a fine spring morning; and\\n    the garden looks fresh and pretty. beyond the\\n    paling the tops of a couple of minarets can be\\n    seen, shewing that there is a valley there, with\\n    the little town in it. a few miles further the\\n    balkan mountains rise and shut in the view. within\\n    the garden the side of the house is seen on the\\n    right, with a garden door reached by a little\\n    flight of steps. on the left the stable yard, with\\n    its gateway, encroaches on the garden. there are\\n    fruit bushes along the paling and house, covered\\n    with washing hung out to dry. a path runs by the\\n    house, and rises by two steps at the corner where\\n    it turns out of the right along the front. in the\\n    middle a small table, with two bent wood chairs at\\n    it, is laid for breakfast with turkish coffee pot,\\n    cups, rolls, etc.; but the cups have been used and\\n    the bread broken. there is a wooden garden seat\\n    against the wall on the left.\\n\\n    louka, smoking a cigaret, is standing between the\\n    table and the house, turning her back with angry\\n    disdain on a man-servant who is lecturing her. he\\n    is a middle-aged man of cool temperament and low\\n    but clear and keen intelligence, with the\\n    complacency of the servant who values himself on\\n    his rank in servility, and the imperturbability of\\n    the accurate calculator who has no illusions. he\\n    wears a white bulgarian costume jacket with\\n    decorated border, sash, wide knickerbockers, and\\n    decorated gaiters. his head is shaved up to the\\n    crown, giving him a high japanese forehead. his\\n    name is nicola.\\n\\nnicola. be warned in time, louka: mend your manners. i know the\\nmistress. she is so grand that she never dreams that any servant\\ncould dare to be disrespectful to her; but if she once suspects\\nthat you are defying her, out you go.\\n\\nlouka. i do defy her. i will defy her. what do i care for her?\\n\\nnicola. if you quarrel with the family, i never can marry you.\\nit's the same as if you quarrelled with me!\\n\\nlouka. you take her part against me, do you?\\n\\nnicola (sedately). i shall always be dependent on the good will\\nof the family. when i leave their service and start a shop in\\nsofia, their custom will be half my capital: their bad word\\nwould ruin me.\\n\\nlouka. you have no spirit. i should like to see them dare say a\\nword against me!\\n\\nnicola (pityingly). i should have expected more sense from you,\\nlouka. but you're young, you're young!\\n\\nlouka. yes; and you like me the better for it, don't you? but i\\nknow some family secrets they wouldn't care to have told, young\\nas i am. let them quarrel with me if they dare!\\n\\nnicola (with compassionate superiority). do you know what they\\nwould do if they heard you talk like that?\\n\\nlouka. what could they do?\\n\\nnicola. discharge you for untruthfulness. who would believe any\\nstories you told after that? who would give you another\\nsituation? who in this house would dare be seen speaking to you\\never again? how long would your father be left on his little\\nfarm? (she impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret, and\\nstamps on it.) child, you don't know the power such high people\\nhave over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our\\npoverty against them. (he goes close to her and lowers his\\nvoice.) look at me, ten years in their service. do you think i\\nknow no secrets? i know things about the mistress that she\\nwouldn't have the master know for a thousand levas. i know\\nthings about him that she wouldn't let him hear the last of for\\nsix months if i blabbed them to her. i know things about raina\\nthat would break off her match with sergius if--\\n\\nlouka (turning on him quickly). how do you know? i never told\\nyou!\\n\\nnicola (opening his eyes cunningly). so that's your little\\nsecret, is it? i thought it might be something like that. well,\\nyou take my advice, and be respectful; and make the mistress\\nfeel that no matter what you know or don't know, they can depend\\non you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully.\\nthat's what they like; and that's how you'll make most out of\\nthem.\\n\\nlouka (with searching scorn). you have the soul of a servant,\\nnicola.\\n\\nnicola (complacently). yes: that's the secret of success in\\nservice.\\n\\n    (a loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden\\n     door, outside on the left, is heard.)\\n\\nmale voice outside. hollo! hollo there! nicola!\\n\\nlouka. master! back from the war!\\n\\nnicola (quickly). my word for it, louka, the war's over. off\\nwith you and get some fresh coffee. (he runs out into the stable\\nyard.)\\n\\nlouka (as she puts the coffee pot and the cups upon the tray,\\nand carries it into the house). you'll never put the soul of a\\nservant into me.\\n\\n   (major petkoff comes from the stable yard,\\n    followed by nicola. he is a cheerful, excitable,\\n    insignificant, unpolished man of about 50,\\n    naturally unambitious except as to his income and\\n    his importance in local society, but just now\\n    greatly pleased with the military rank which the\\n    war has thrust on him as a man of consequence in\\n    his town. the fever of plucky patriotism which the\\n    servian attack roused in all the bulgarians has\\n    pulled him through the war; but he is obviously\\n    glad to be home again.)\\n\\npetkoff (pointing to the table with his whip). breakfast out\\nhere, eh?\\n\\nnicola. yes, sir. the mistress and miss raina have just gone in.\\n\\npetkoff (fitting down and taking a roll). go in and say i've\\ncome; and get me some fresh coffee.\\n\\nnicola. it's coming, sir. (he goes to the house door. louka,\\nwith fresh coffee, a clean cup, and a brandy bottle on her tray\\nmeets him.) have you told the mistress?\\n\\nlouka. yes: she's coming.\\n\\n    (nicola goes into the house. louka brings the\\n     coffee to the table.)\\n\\npetkoff. well, the servians haven't run away with you, have\\nthey?\\n\\nlouka. no, sir.\\n\\npetkoff. that's right. have you brought me some cognac?\\n\\nlouka (putting the bottle on the table). here, sir.\\n\\npetkoff. that's right. (he pours some into his coffee.)\\n\\n   (catherine who has at this early hour made only a\\n    very perfunctory toilet, and wears a bulgarian\\n    apron over a once brilliant, but now half worn out\\n    red dressing gown, and a colored handkerchief tied\\n    over her thick black hair, with turkish slippers\\n    on her bare feet, comes from the house, looking\\n    astonishingly handsome and stately under all the\\n    circumstances. louka goes into the house.)\\n\\ncatherine. my dear paul, what a surprise for us. (she stoops\\nover the back of his chair to kiss him.) have they brought you\\nfresh coffee?\\n\\npetkoff. yes, louka's been looking after me. the war's over. the\\ntreaty was signed three days ago at bucharest; and the decree\\nfor our army to demobilize was issued yesterday.\\n\\ncatherine (springing erect, with flashing eyes). the war over!\\npaul: have you let the austrians force you to make peace?\\n\\npetkoff (submissively). my dear: they didn't consult me. what\\ncould _i_ do? (she sits down and turns away from him.) but of\\ncourse we saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one. it\\ndeclares peace--\\n\\ncatherine (outraged). peace!\\n\\npetkoff (appeasing her).--but not friendly relations: remember\\nthat. they wanted to put that in; but i insisted on its being\\nstruck out. what more could i do?\\n\\ncatherine. you could have annexed servia and made prince\\nalexander emperor of the balkans. that's what i would have done.\\n\\npetkoff. i don't doubt it in the least, my dear. but i should\\nhave had to subdue the whole austrian empire first; and that\\nwould have kept me too long away from you. i missed you greatly.\\n\\ncatherine (relenting). ah! (stretches her hand affectionately\\nacross the table to squeeze his.)\\n\\npetkoff. and how have you been, my dear?\\n\\ncatherine. oh, my usual sore throats, that's all.\\n\\npetkoff (with conviction). that comes from washing your neck\\nevery day. i've often told you so.\\n\\ncatherine. nonsense, paul!\\n\\npetkoff (over his coffee and cigaret). i don't believe in going\\ntoo far with these modern customs. all this washing can't be\\ngood for the health: it's not natural. there was an englishman\\nat phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold\\nwater every morning when he got up. disgusting! it all comes\\nfrom the english: their climate makes them so dirty that they\\nhave to be perpetually washing themselves. look at my father: he\\nnever had a bath in his life; and he lived to be ninety-eight,\\nthe healthiest man in bulgaria. i don't mind a good wash once a\\nweek to keep up my position; but once a day is carrying the\\nthing to a ridiculous extreme.\\n\\ncatherine. you are a barbarian at heart still, paul. i hope you\\nbehaved yourself before all those russian officers.\\n\\npetkoff. i did my best. i took care to let them know that we had\\na library.\\n\\ncatherine. ah; but you didn't tell them that we have an electric\\nbell in it? i have had one put up.\\n\\npetkoff. what's an electric bell?\\n\\ncatherine. you touch a button; something tinkles in the kitchen;\\nand then nicola comes up.\\n\\npetkoff. why not shout for him?\\n\\ncatherine. civilized people never shout for their servants. i've\\nlearnt that while you were away.\\n\\npetkoff. well, i'll tell you something i've learnt, too.\\ncivilized people don't hang out their washing to dry where\\nvisitors can see it; so you'd better have all that (indicating\\nthe clothes on the bushes) put somewhere else.\\n\\ncatherine. oh, that's absurd, paul: i don't believe really\\nrefined people notice such things.\\n\\n    (someone is heard knocking at the stable gates.)\\n\\npetkoff. there's sergius. (shouting.) hollo, nicola!\\n\\ncatherine. oh, don't shout, paul: it really isn't nice.\\n\\npetkoff. bosh! (he shouts louder than before.) nicola!\\n\\nnicola (appearing at the house door). yes, sir.\\n\\npetkoff. if that is major saranoff, bring him round this way.\\n(he pronounces the name with the stress on the second\\nsyllable--sarah-noff.)\\n\\nnicola. yes, sir. (he goes into the stable yard.)\\n\\npetkoff. you must talk to him, my dear, until raina takes him\\noff our hands. he bores my life out about our not promoting\\nhim--over my head, mind you.\\n\\ncatherine. he certainly ought to be promoted when he marries\\nraina. besides, the country should insist on having at least one\\nnative general.\\n\\npetkoff. yes, so that he could throw away whole brigades instead\\nof regiments. it's no use, my dear: he has not the slightest\\nchance of promotion until we are quite sure that the peace will\\nbe a lasting one.\\n\\nnicola (at the gate, announcing). major sergius saranoff! (he\\ngoes into the house and returns presently with a third chair,\\nwhich he places at the table. he then withdraws.)\\n\\n   (major sergius saranoff, the original of the\\n    portrait in raina's room, is a tall, romantically\\n    handsome man, with the physical hardihood, the\\n    high spirit, and the susceptible imagination of an\\n    untamed mountaineer chieftain. but his remarkable\\n    personal distinction is of a characteristically\\n    civilized type. the ridges of his eyebrows,\\n    curving with a ram's-horn twist round the marked\\n    projections at the outer corners, his jealously\\n    observant eye, his nose, thin, keen, and\\n    apprehensive in spite of the pugnacious high\\n    bridge and large nostril, his assertive chin,\\n    would not be out of place in a paris salon. in\\n    short, the clever, imaginative barbarian has an\\n    acute critical faculty which has been thrown into\\n    intense activity by the arrival of western\\n    civilization in the balkans; and the result is\\n    precisely what the advent of nineteenth-century\\n    thought first produced in england: to-wit,\\n    byronism. by his brooding on the perpetual\\n    failure, not only of others, but of himself, to\\n    live up to his imaginative ideals, his consequent\\n    cynical scorn for humanity, the jejune credulity\\n    as to the absolute validity of his ideals and the\\n    unworthiness of the world in disregarding them,\\n    his wincings and mockeries under the sting of the\\n    petty disillusions which every hour spent among\\n    men brings to his infallibly quick observation, he\\n    has acquired the half tragic, half ironic air, the\\n    mysterious moodiness, the suggestion of a strange\\n    and terrible history that has left him nothing but\\n    undying remorse, by which childe harold fascinated\\n    the grandmothers of his english contemporaries.\\n    altogether it is clear that here or nowhere is\\n    raina's ideal hero. catherine is hardly less\\n    enthusiastic, and much less reserved in shewing\\n    her enthusiasm. as he enters from the stable gate,\\n    she rises effusively to greet him. petkoff is\\n    distinctly less disposed to make a fuss about\\n    him.)\\n\\npetkoff. here already, sergius. glad to see you!\\n\\ncatherine. my dear sergius!(she holds out both her hands.)\\n\\nsergius (kissing them with scrupulous gallantry). my dear\\nmother, if i may call you so.\\n\\npetkoff (drily). mother-in-law, sergius; mother-in-law! sit\\ndown, and have some coffee.\\n\\nsergius. thank you, none for me. (he gets away from the table\\nwith a certain distaste for petkoff's enjoyment of it, and posts\\nhimself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps\\nleading to the house.)\\n\\ncatherine. you look superb--splendid. the campaign has improved\\nyou. everybody here is mad about you. we were all wild with\\nenthusiasm about that magnificent cavalry charge.\\n\\nsergius (with grave irony). madam: it was the cradle and the\\ngrave of my military reputation.\\n\\ncatherine. how so?\\n\\nsergius. i won the battle the wrong way when our worthy russian\\ngenerals were losing it the right way. that upset their plans,\\nand wounded their self-esteem. two of their colonels got their\\nregiments driven back on the correct principles of scientific\\nwarfare. two major-generals got killed strictly according to\\nmilitary etiquette. those two colonels are now major-generals;\\nand i am still a simple major.\\n\\ncatherine. you shall not remain so, sergius. the women are on\\nyour side; and they will see that justice is done you.\\n\\nsergius. it is too late. i have only waited for the peace to\\nsend in my resignation.\\n\\npetkoff (dropping his cup in his amazement). your resignation!\\n\\ncatherine. oh, you must withdraw it!\\n\\nsergius (with resolute, measured emphasis, folding his arms). i\\nnever withdraw!\\n\\npetkoff (vexed). now who could have supposed you were going to\\ndo such a thing?\\n\\nsergius (with fire). everyone that knew me. but enough of\\nmyself and my affairs. how is raina; and where is raina?\\n\\nraina (suddenly coming round the corner of the house and\\nstanding at the top of the steps in the path). raina is here.\\n(she makes a charming picture as they all turn to look at her.\\nshe wears an underdress of pale green silk, draped with an\\noverdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold. on her head\\nshe wears a pretty phrygian cap of gold tinsel. sergius, with an\\nexclamation of pleasure, goes impulsively to meet her. she\\nstretches out her hand: he drops chivalrously on one knee and\\nkisses it.)\\n\\npetkoff (aside to catherine, beaming with parental pride).\\npretty, isn't it? she always appears at the right moment.\\n\\ncatherine (impatiently). yes: she listens for it. it is an\\nabominable habit.\\n\\n    (sergius leads raina forward with splendid gallantry,\\n     as if she were a queen. when they come to the\\n     table, she turns to him with a bend of the head;\\n     he bows; and thus they separate, he coming to his\\n     place, and she going behind her father's chair.)\\n\\nraina (stooping and kissing her father). dear father! welcome\\nhome!\\n\\npetkoff (patting her cheek). my little pet girl. (he kisses\\nher; she goes to the chair left by nicola for sergius, and sits\\ndown.)\\n\\ncatherine. and so you're no longer a soldier, sergius.\\n\\nsergius. i am no longer a soldier. soldiering, my dear madam, is\\nthe coward's art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong,\\nand keeping out of harm's way when you are weak. that is the\\nwhole secret of successful fighting. get your enemy at a\\ndisadvantage; and never, on any account, fight him on equal\\nterms. eh, major!\\n\\npetkoff. they wouldn't let us make a fair stand-up fight of it.\\nhowever, i suppose soldiering has to be a trade like any other\\ntrade.\\n\\nsergius. precisely. but i have no ambition to succeed as a\\ntradesman; so i have taken the advice of that bagman of a\\ncaptain that settled the exchange of prisoners with us at\\npeerot, and given it up.\\n\\npetkoff. what, that swiss fellow? sergius: i've often thought of\\nthat exchange since. he over-reached us about those horses.\\n\\nsergius. of course he over-reached us. his father was a hotel\\nand livery stable keeper; and he owed his first step to his\\nknowledge of horse-dealing. (with mock enthusiasm.) ah, he was a\\nsoldier--every inch a soldier! if only i had bought the horses\\nfor my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger, i\\nshould have been a field-marshal now!\\n\\ncatherine. a swiss? what was he doing in the servian army?\\n\\npetkoff. a volunteer of course--keen on picking up his\\nprofession. (chuckling.) we shouldn't have been able to begin\\nfighting if these foreigners hadn't shewn us how to do it: we\\nknew nothing about it; and neither did the servians. egad,\\nthere'd have been no war without them.\\n\\nraina. are there many swiss officers in the servian army?\\n\\npetkoff. no--all austrians, just as our officers were all\\nrussians. this was the only swiss i came across. i'll never\\ntrust a swiss again. he cheated us--humbugged us into giving\\nhim fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out\\nchargers. they weren't even eatable!\\n\\nsergius. we were two children in the hands of that consummate\\nsoldier, major: simply two innocent little children.\\n\\nraina. what was he like?\\n\\ncatherine. oh, raina, what a silly question!\\n\\nsergius. he was like a commercial traveller in uniform.\\nbourgeois to his boots.\\n\\npetkoff (grinning). sergius: tell catherine that queer story\\nhis friend told us about him--how he escaped after slivnitza.\\nyou remember?--about his being hid by two women.\\n\\nsergius (with bitter irony). oh, yes, quite a romance. he was\\nserving in the very battery i so unprofessionally charged. being\\na thorough soldier, he ran away like the rest of them, with our\\ncavalry at his heels. to escape their attentions, he had the\\ngood taste to take refuge in the chamber of some patriotic young\\nbulgarian lady. the young lady was enchanted by his persuasive\\ncommercial traveller's manners. she very modestly entertained\\nhim for an hour or so and then called in her mother lest her\\nconduct should appear unmaidenly. the old lady was equally\\nfascinated; and the fugitive was sent on his way in the morning,\\ndisguised in an old coat belonging to the master of the house,\\nwho was away at the war.\\n\\nraina (rising with marked stateliness). your life in the camp\\nhas made you coarse, sergius. i did not think you would have\\nrepeated such a story before me. (she turns away coldly.)\\n\\ncatherine (also rising). she is right, sergius. if such women\\nexist, we should be spared the knowledge of them.\\n\\npetkoff. pooh! nonsense! what does it matter?\\n\\nsergius (ashamed). no, petkoff: i was wrong. (to raina, with\\nearnest humility.) i beg your pardon. i have behaved abominably.\\nforgive me, raina. (she bows reservedly.) and you, too, madam.\\n(catherine bows graciously and sits down. he proceeds solemnly,\\nagain addressing raina.) the glimpses i have had of the seamy\\nside of life during the last few months have made me cynical;\\nbut i should not have brought my cynicism here--least of all\\ninto your presence, raina. i--(here, turning to the others, he\\nis evidently about to begin a long speech when the major\\ninterrupts him.)\\n\\npetkoff. stuff and nonsense, sergius. that's quite enough fuss\\nabout nothing: a soldier's daughter should be able to stand up\\nwithout flinching to a little strong conversation. (he rises.)\\ncome: it's time for us to get to business. we have to make up\\nour minds how those three regiments are to get back to\\nphillipopolis:--there's no forage for them on the sofia route.\\n(he goes towards the house.) come along. (sergius is about to\\nfollow him when catherine rises and intervenes.)\\n\\ncatherine. oh, paul, can't you spare sergius for a few moments?\\nraina has hardly seen him yet. perhaps i can help you to settle\\nabout the regiments.\\n\\nsergius (protesting). my dear madam, impossible: you--\\n\\ncatherine (stopping him playfully). you stay here, my dear\\nsergius: there's no hurry. i have a word or two to say to paul.\\n(sergius instantly bows and steps back.) now, dear (taking\\npetkoff's arm), come and see the electric bell.\\n\\npetkoff. oh, very well, very well. (they go into the house\\ntogether affectionately. sergius, left alone with raina, looks\\nanxiously at her, fearing that she may be still offended. she\\nsmiles, and stretches out her arms to him.)\\n\\n    (exit r. into house, followed by catherine.)\\n\\nsergius (hastening to her, but refraining from touching her\\nwithout express permission). am i forgiven?\\n\\nraina (placing her hands on his shoulder as she looks up at him\\nwith admiration and worship). my hero! my king.\\n\\nsergius. my queen! (he kisses her on the forehead with holy\\nawe.)\\n\\nraina. how i have envied you, sergius! you have been out in the\\nworld, on the field of battle, able to prove yourself there\\nworthy of any woman in the world; whilst i have had to sit at\\nhome inactive,--dreaming--useless--doing nothing that could\\ngive me the right to call myself worthy of any man.\\n\\nsergius. dearest, all my deeds have been yours. you inspired me.\\ni have gone through the war like a knight in a tournament with\\nhis lady looking on at him!\\n\\nraina. and you have never been absent from my thoughts for a\\nmoment. (very solemnly.) sergius: i think we two have found the\\nhigher love. when i think of you, i feel that i could never do a\\nbase deed, or think an ignoble thought.\\n\\nsergius. my lady, and my saint! (clasping her reverently.)\\n\\nraina (returning his embrace). my lord and my g--\\n\\nsergius. sh--sh! let me be the worshipper, dear. you little know\\nhow unworthy even the best man is of a girl's pure passion!\\n\\nraina. i trust you. i love you. you will never disappoint me,\\nsergius. (louka is heard singing within the house. they quickly\\nrelease each other.) hush! i can't pretend to talk indifferently\\nbefore her: my heart is too full. (louka comes from the house\\nwith her tray. she goes to the table, and begins to clear it,\\nwith her back turned to them.) i will go and get my hat; and\\nthen we can go out until lunch time. wouldn't you like that?\\n\\nsergius. be quick. if you are away five minutes, it will seem\\nfive hours. (raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there\\nto exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands.\\nhe looks after her with emotion for a moment, then turns slowly\\naway, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which\\nhas just passed. the movement shifts his field of vision, into\\nthe corner of which there now comes the tail of louka's double\\napron. his eye gleams at once. he takes a stealthy look at her,\\nand begins to twirl his moustache nervously, with his left hand\\nakimbo on his hip. finally, striking the ground with his heels\\nin something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left\\nof the table, opposite her, and says) louka: do you know what\\nthe higher love is?\\n\\nlouka (astonished). no, sir.\\n\\nsergius. very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time,\\nlouka. one feels the need of some relief after it.\\n\\nlouka (innocently). perhaps you would like some coffee, sir?\\n(she stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot.)\\n\\nsergius (taking her hand). thank you, louka.\\n\\nlouka (pretending to pull). oh, sir, you know i didn't mean\\nthat. i'm surprised at you!\\n\\nsergius (coming clear of the table and drawing her with him). i\\nam surprised at myself, louka. what would sergius, the hero of\\nslivnitza, say if he saw me now? what would sergius, the apostle\\nof the higher love, say if he saw me now? what would the half\\ndozen sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome\\nfigure of mine say if they caught us here? (letting go her hand\\nand slipping his arm dexterously round her waist.) do you\\nconsider my figure handsome, louka?\\n\\nlouka. let me go, sir. i shall be disgraced. (she struggles: he\\nholds her inexorably.) oh, will you let go?\\n\\nsergius (looking straight into her eyes). no.\\n\\nlouka. then stand back where we can't be seen. have you no\\ncommon sense?\\n\\nsergius. ah, that's reasonable. (he takes her into the\\nstableyard gateway, where they are hidden from the house.)\\n\\nlouka (complaining). i may have been seen from the windows:\\nmiss raina is sure to be spying about after you.\\n\\nsergius (stung--letting her go). take care, louka. i may be\\nworthless enough to betray the higher love; but do not you\\ninsult it.\\n\\nlouka (demurely). not for the world, sir, i'm sure. may i go on\\nwith my work please, now?\\n\\nsergius (again putting his arm round her). you are a provoking\\nlittle witch, louka. if you were in love with me, would you spy\\nout of windows on me?\\n\\nlouka. well, you see, sir, since you say you are half a dozen\\ndifferent gentlemen all at once, i should have a great deal to\\nlook after.\\n\\nsergius (charmed). witty as well as pretty. (he tries to kiss\\nher.)\\n\\nlouka (avoiding him). no, i don't want your kisses. gentlefolk\\nare all alike--you making love to me behind miss raina's back,\\nand she doing the same behind yours.\\n\\nsergius (recoiling a step). louka!\\n\\nlouka. it shews how little you really care!\\n\\nsergius (dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing\\npoliteness). if our conversation is to continue, louka, you will\\nplease remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of\\nthe lady he is engaged to with her maid.\\n\\nlouka. it's so hard to know what a gentleman considers right. i\\nthought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being\\nso particular.\\n\\nsergius (turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes\\nback into the garden from the gateway). devil! devil!\\n\\nlouka. ha! ha! i expect one of the six of you is very like me,\\nsir, though i am only miss raina's maid. (she goes back to her\\nwork at the table, taking no further notice of him.)\\n\\nsergius (speaking to himself). which of the six is the real\\nman?--that's the question that torments me. one of them is a\\nhero, another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a\\nbit of a blackguard. (he pauses and looks furtively at louka, as\\nhe adds with deep bitterness) and one, at least, is a\\ncoward--jealous, like all cowards. (he goes to the table.)\\nlouka.\\n\\nlouka. yes?\\n\\nsergius. who is my rival?\\n\\nlouka. you shall never get that out of me, for love or money.\\n\\nsergius. why?\\n\\nlouka. never mind why. besides, you would tell that i told you;\\nand i should lose my place.\\n\\nsergius (holding out his right hand in affirmation). no; on the\\nhonor of a--(he checks himself, and his hand drops nerveless as\\nhe concludes, sardonically)--of a man capable of behaving as i\\nhave been behaving for the last five minutes. who is he?\\n\\nlouka. i don't know. i never saw him. i only heard his voice\\nthrough the door of her room.\\n\\nsergius. damnation! how dare you?\\n\\nlouka (retreating). oh, i mean no harm: you've no right to take\\nup my words like that. the mistress knows all about it. and i\\ntell you that if that gentleman ever comes here again, miss\\nraina will marry him, whether he likes it or not. i know the\\ndifference between the sort of manner you and she put on before\\none another and the real manner. (sergius shivers as if she had\\nstabbed him. then, setting his face like iron, he strides grimly\\nto her, and grips her above the elbows with both bands.)\\n\\nsergius. now listen you to me!\\n\\nlouka (wincing). not so tight: you're hurting me!\\n\\nsergius. that doesn't matter. you have stained my honor by\\nmaking me a party to your eavesdropping. and you have betrayed\\nyour mistress--\\n\\nlouka (writhing). please--\\n\\nsergius. that shews that you are an abominable little clod of\\ncommon clay, with the soul of a servant. (he lets her go as if\\nshe were an unclean thing, and turns away, dusting his hands of\\nher, to the bench by the wall, where he sits down with averted\\nhead, meditating gloomily.)\\n\\nlouka (whimpering angrily with her hands up her sleeves,\\nfeeling her bruised arms). you know how to hurt with your tongue\\nas well as with your hands. but i don't care, now i've found out\\nthat whatever clay i'm made of, you're made of the same. as for\\nher, she's a liar; and her fine airs are a cheat; and i'm worth\\nsix of her. (she shakes the pain off hardily; tosses her head;\\nand sets to work to put the things on the tray. he looks\\ndoubtfully at her once or twice. she finishes packing the tray,\\nand laps the cloth over the edges, so as to carry all out\\ntogether. as she stoops to lift it, he rises.)\\n\\nsergius. louka! (she stops and looks defiantly at him with the\\ntray in her hands.) a gentleman has no right to hurt a woman\\nunder any circumstances. (with profound humility, uncovering his\\nhead.) i beg your pardon.\\n\\nlouka. that sort of apology may satisfy a lady. of what use is\\nit to a servant?\\n\\nsergius (thus rudely crossed in his chivalry, throws it off\\nwith a bitter laugh and says slightingly). oh, you wish to be\\npaid for the hurt? (he puts on his shako, and takes some money\\nfrom his pocket.)\\n\\nlouka (her eyes filling with tears in spite of herself). no, i\\nwant my hurt made well.\\n\\nsergius (sobered by her tone). how?\\n\\n   (she rolls up her left sleeve; clasps her arm with\\n    the thumb and fingers of her right hand; and looks\\n    down at the bruise. then she raises her head and\\n    looks straight at him. finally, with a superb\\n    gesture she presents her arm to be kissed. amazed,\\n    he looks at her; at the arm; at her again;\\n    hesitates; and then, with shuddering intensity,\\n    exclaims)\\n\\nsergius. never! (and gets away as far as possible from her.)\\n\\n   (her arm drops. without a word, and with unaffected\\n    dignity, she takes her tray, and is approaching\\n    the house when raina returns wearing a hat and\\n    jacket in the height of the vienna fashion of the\\n    previous year, 1885. louka makes way proudly for\\n    her, and then goes into the house.)\\n\\nraina. i'm ready! what's the matter? (gaily.) have you been\\nflirting with louka?\\n\\nsergius (hastily). no, no. how can you think such a thing?\\n\\nraina (ashamed of herself). forgive me, dear: it was only a\\njest. i am so happy to-day.\\n\\n    (he goes quickly to her, and kisses her hand\\n     remorsefully. catherine comes out and calls\\n     to them from the top of the steps.)\\n\\ncatherine (coming down to them). i am sorry to disturb you,\\nchildren; but paul is distracted over those three regiments. he\\ndoes not know how to get them to phillipopolis; and he objects\\nto every suggestion of mine. you must go and help him, sergius.\\nhe is in the library.\\n\\nraina (disappointed). but we are just going out for a walk.\\n\\nsergius. i shall not be long. wait for me just five minutes. (he\\nruns up the steps to the door.)\\n\\nraina (following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at\\nhim with timid coquetry). i shall go round and wait in full view\\nof the library windows. be sure you draw father's attention to\\nme. if you are a moment longer than five minutes, i shall go in\\nand fetch you, regiments or no regiments.\\n\\nsergius (laughing). very well. (he goes in. raina watches him\\nuntil he is out of her sight. then, with a perceptible\\nrelaxation of manner, she begins to pace up and down about the\\ngarden in a brown study.)\\n\\ncatherine. imagine their meeting that swiss and hearing the\\nwhole story! the very first thing your father asked for was the\\nold coat we sent him off in. a nice mess you have got us into!\\n\\nraina (gazing thoughtfully at the gravel as she walks). the\\nlittle beast!\\n\\ncatherine. little beast! what little beast?\\n\\nraina. to go and tell! oh, if i had him here, i'd stuff him with\\nchocolate creams till he couldn't ever speak again!\\n\\ncatherine. don't talk nonsense. tell me the truth, raina. how\\nlong was he in your room before you came to me?\\n\\nraina (whisking round and recommencing her march in the\\nopposite direction). oh, i forget.\\n\\ncatherine. you cannot forget! did he really climb up after the\\nsoldiers were gone, or was he there when that officer searched\\nthe room?\\n\\nraina. no. yes, i think he must have been there then.\\n\\ncatherine. you think! oh, raina, raina! will anything ever make\\nyou straightforward? if sergius finds out, it is all over\\nbetween you.\\n\\nraina (with cool impertinence). oh, i know sergius is your pet.\\ni sometimes wish you could marry him instead of me. you would\\njust suit him. you would pet him, and spoil him, and mother him\\nto perfection.\\n\\ncatherine (opening her eyes very widely indeed). well, upon my\\nword!\\n\\nraina (capriciously--half to herself). i always feel a longing\\nto do or say something dreadful to him--to shock his\\npropriety--to scandalize the five senses out of him! (to\\ncatherine perversely.) i don't care whether he finds out about\\nthe chocolate cream soldier or not. i half hope he may. (she\\nagain turns flippantly away and strolls up the path to the\\ncorner of the house.)\\n\\ncatherine. and what should i be able to say to your father,\\npray?\\n\\nraina (over her shoulder, from the top of the two steps). oh,\\npoor father! as if he could help himself! (she turns the corner\\nand passes out of sight.)\\n\\ncatherine (looking after her, her fingers itching). oh, if you\\nwere only ten years younger! (louka comes from the house with a\\nsalver, which she carries hanging down by her side.) well?\\n\\nlouka. there's a gentleman just called, madam--a servian\\nofficer--\\n\\ncatherine (flaming). a servian! how dare he--(checking herself\\nbitterly.) oh, i forgot. we are at peace now. i suppose we shall\\nhave them calling every day to pay their compliments. well, if\\nhe is an officer why don't you tell your master? he is in the\\nlibrary with major saranoff. why do you come to me?\\n\\nlouka. but he asks for you, madam. and i don't think he knows\\nwho you are: he said the lady of the house. he gave me this\\nlittle ticket for you. (she takes a card out of her bosom; puts\\nit on the salver and offers it to catherine.)\\n\\ncatherine (reading). \\\"captain bluntschli!\\\" that's a german\\nname.\\n\\nlouka. swiss, madam, i think.\\n\\ncatherine (with a bound that makes louka jump back). swiss!\\nwhat is he like?\\n\\nlouka (timidly). he has a big carpet bag, madam.\\n\\ncatherine. oh, heavens, he's come to return the coat! send him\\naway--say we're not at home--ask him to leave his address and\\ni'll write to him--oh, stop: that will never do. wait! (she\\nthrows herself into a chair to think it out. louka waits.) the\\nmaster and major saranoff are busy in the library, aren't they?\\n\\nlouka. yes, madam.\\n\\ncatherine (decisively). bring the gentleman out here at once.\\n(imperatively.) and be very polite to him. don't delay. here\\n(impatiently snatching the salver from her): leave that here;\\nand go straight back to him.\\n\\nlouka. yes, madam. (going.)\\n\\ncatherine. louka!\\n\\nlouka (stopping). yes, madam.\\n\\ncatherine. is the library door shut?\\n\\nlouka. i think so, madam.\\n\\ncatherine. if not, shut it as you pass through.\\n\\nlouka. yes, madam. (going.)\\n\\ncatherine. stop! (louka stops.) he will have to go out that way\\n(indicating the gate of the stable yard). tell nicola to bring\\nhis bag here after him. don't forget.\\n\\nlouka (surprised). his bag?\\n\\ncatherine. yes, here, as soon as possible. (vehemently.) be\\nquick! (louka runs into the house. catherine snatches her apron\\noff and throws it behind a bush. she then takes up the salver\\nand uses it as a mirror, with the result that the handkerchief\\ntied round her head follows the apron. a touch to her hair and a\\nshake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.) oh,\\nhow--how--how can a man be such a fool! such a moment to select!\\n(louka appears at the door of the house, announcing \\\"captain\\nbluntschli;\\\" and standing aside at the top of the steps to let\\nhim pass before she goes in again. he is the man of the\\nadventure in raina's room. he is now clean, well brushed,\\nsmartly uniformed, and out of trouble, but still unmistakably\\nthe same man. the moment louka's back is turned, catherine\\nswoops on him with hurried, urgent, coaxing appeal.) captain\\nbluntschli, i am very glad to see you; but you must leave this\\nhouse at once. (he raises his eyebrows.) my husband has just\\nreturned, with my future son-in-law; and they know nothing. if\\nthey did, the consequences would be terrible. you are a\\nforeigner: you do not feel our national animosities as we do. we\\nstill hate the servians: the only effect of the peace on my\\nhusband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey. if\\nhe discovered our secret, he would never forgive me; and my\\ndaughter's life would hardly be safe. will you, like the\\nchivalrous gentleman and soldier you are, leave at once before\\nhe finds you here?\\n\\nbluntschli (disappointed, but philosophical). at once, gracious\\nlady. i only came to thank you and return the coat you lent me.\\nif you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with\\nyour servant as i pass out, i need detain you no further. (he\\nturns to go into the house.)\\n\\ncatherine (catching him by the sleeve). oh, you must not think\\nof going back that way. (coaxing him across to the stable\\ngates.) this is the shortest way out. many thanks. so glad to\\nhave been of service to you. good-bye.\\n\\nbluntschli. but my bag?\\n\\ncatherine. it will be sent on. you will leave me your address.\\n\\nbluntschli. true. allow me. (he takes out his card-case, and\\nstops to write his address, keeping catherine in an agony of\\nimpatience. as he hands her the card, petkoff, hatless, rushes\\nfrom the house in a fluster of hospitality, followed by\\nsergius.)\\n\\npetkoff (as he hurries down the steps). my dear captain\\nbluntschli--\\n\\ncatherine. oh heavens! (she sinks on the seat against the wall.)\\n\\npetkoff (too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes\\nbluntschli's hand heartily). those stupid people of mine thought\\ni was out here, instead of in the--haw!--library. (he cannot\\nmention the library without betraying how proud he is of it.) i\\nsaw you through the window. i was wondering why you didn't come\\nin. saranoff is with me: you remember him, don't you?\\n\\nsergius (saluting humorously, and then offering his hand with\\ngreat charm of manner). welcome, our friend the enemy!\\n\\npetkoff. no longer the enemy, happily. (rather anxiously.) i\\nhope you've come as a friend, and not on business.\\n\\ncatherine. oh, quite as a friend, paul. i was just asking\\ncaptain bluntschli to stay to lunch; but he declares he must go\\nat once.\\n\\nsergius (sardonically). impossible, bluntschli. we want you\\nhere badly. we have to send on three cavalry regiments to\\nphillipopolis; and we don't in the least know how to do it.\\n\\nbluntschli (suddenly attentive and business-like).\\nphillipopolis! the forage is the trouble, eh?\\n\\npetkoff (eagerly). yes, that's it. (to sergius.) he sees the\\nwhole thing at once.\\n\\nbluntschli. i think i can shew you how to manage that.\\n\\nsergius. invaluable man! come along! (towering over bluntschli,\\nhe puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps,\\npetkoff following. as bluntschli puts his foot on the first\\nstep, raina comes out of the house.)\\n\\nraina (completely losing her presence of mind). oh, the\\nchocolate cream soldier!\\n\\n    (bluntschli stands rigid. sergius, amazed, looks\\n     at raina, then at petkoff, who looks back at him\\n     and then at his wife.)\\n\\ncatherine (with commanding presence of mind). my dear raina,\\ndon't you see that we have a guest here--captain bluntschli, one\\nof our new servian friends?\\n\\n    (raina bows; bluntschli bows.)\\n\\nraina. how silly of me! (she comes down into the centre of the\\ngroup, between bluntschli and petkoff) i made a beautiful\\nornament this morning for the ice pudding; and that stupid\\nnicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it.\\n(to bluntschli, winningly.) i hope you didn't think that you\\nwere the chocolate cream soldier, captain bluntschli.\\n\\nbluntschli (laughing). i assure you i did. (stealing a\\nwhimsical glance at her.) your explanation was a relief.\\n\\npetkoff (suspiciously, to raina). and since when, pray, have\\nyou taken to cooking?\\n\\ncatherine. oh, whilst you were away. it is her latest fancy.\\n\\npetkoff (testily). and has nicola taken to drinking? he used to\\nbe careful enough. first he shews captain bluntschli out here\\nwhen he knew quite well i was in the--hum!--library; and then\\nhe goes downstairs and breaks raina's chocolate soldier. he\\nmust--(at this moment nicola appears at the top of the steps r.,\\nwith a carpet bag. he descends; places it respectfully before\\nbluntschli; and waits for further orders. general amazement.\\nnicola, unconscious of the effect he is producing, looks\\nperfectly satisfied with himself. when petkoff recovers his\\npower of speech, he breaks out at him with) are you mad, nicola?\\n\\nnicola (taken aback). sir?\\n\\npetkoff. what have you brought that for?\\n\\nnicola. my lady's orders, sir. louka told me that--\\n\\ncatherine (interrupting him). my orders! why should i order you\\nto bring captain bluntschli's luggage out here? what are you\\nthinking of, nicola?\\n\\nnicola (after a moment's bewilderment, picking up the bag as he\\naddresses bluntschli with the very perfection of servile\\ndiscretion). i beg your pardon, sir, i am sure. (to catherine.)\\nmy fault, madam! i hope you'll overlook it! (he bows, and is\\ngoing to the steps with the bag, when petkoff addresses him\\nangrily.)\\n\\npetkoff. you'd better go and slam that bag, too, down on miss\\nraina's ice pudding! (this is too much for nicola. the bag drops\\nfrom his hands on petkoff's corns, eliciting a roar of anguish\\nfrom him.) begone, you butter-fingered donkey.\\n\\nnicola (snatching up the bag, and escaping into the house).\\nyes, sir.\\n\\ncatherine. oh, never mind, paul, don't be angry!\\n\\npetkoff (muttering). scoundrel. he's got out of hand while i\\nwas away. i'll teach him. (recollecting his guest.) oh, well,\\nnever mind. come, bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about\\nyou having to go away. you know very well you're not going back\\nto switzerland yet. until you do go back you'll stay with us.\\n\\nraina. oh, do, captain bluntschli.\\n\\npetkoff (to catherine). now, catherine, it's of you that he's\\nafraid. press him and he'll stay.\\n\\ncatherine. of course i shall be only too delighted if\\n(appealingly) captain bluntschli really wishes to stay. he knows\\nmy wishes.\\n\\nbluntschli (in his driest military manner). i am at madame's\\norders.\\n\\nsergius (cordially). that settles it!\\n\\npetkoff (heartily). of course!\\n\\nraina. you see, you must stay!\\n\\nbluntschli (smiling). well, if i must, i must!\\n(gesture of despair from catherine.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nact iii\\n\\n\\n    in the library after lunch. it is not much of a\\n    library, its literary equipment consisting of a\\n    single fixed shelf stocked with old paper-covered\\n    novels, broken backed, coffee stained, torn and\\n    thumbed, and a couple of little hanging shelves\\n    with a few gift books on them, the rest of the\\n    wall space being occupied by trophies of war and\\n    the chase. but it is a most comfortable\\n    sitting-room. a row of three large windows in the\\n    front of the house shew a mountain panorama, which\\n    is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in\\n    the mellowing afternoon light. in the left hand\\n    corner, a square earthenware stove, a perfect\\n    tower of colored pottery, rises nearly to the\\n    ceiling and guarantees plenty of warmth. the\\n    ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of\\n    decorated cushions, and the window seats are well\\n    upholstered divans. little turkish tables, one of\\n    them with an elaborate hookah on it, and a screen\\n    to match them, complete the handsome effect of the\\n    furnishing. there is one object, however, which is\\n    hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings.\\n    this is a small kitchen table, much the worse for\\n    wear, fitted as a writing table with an old\\n    canister full of pens, an eggcup filled with ink,\\n    and a deplorable scrap of severely used pink\\n    blotting paper.\\n\\n    at the side of this table, which stands on the\\n    right, bluntschli is hard at work, with a couple\\n    of maps before him, writing orders. at the head of\\n    it sits sergius, who is also supposed to be at\\n    work, but who is actually gnawing the feather of a\\n    pen, and contemplating bluntschli's quick, sure,\\n    businesslike progress with a mixture of envious\\n    irritation at his own incapacity, and awestruck\\n    wonder at an ability which seems to him almost\\n    miraculous, though its prosaic character forbids\\n    him to esteem it. the major is comfortably\\n    established on the ottoman, with a newspaper in\\n    his hand and the tube of the hookah within his\\n    reach. catherine sits at the stove, with her back\\n    to them, embroidering. raina, reclining on the\\n    divan under the left hand window, is gazing in a\\n    daydream out at the balkan landscape, with a\\n    neglected novel in her lap.\\n\\n    the door is on the left. the button of the\\n    electric bell is between the door and the\\n    fireplace.\\n\\npetkoff (looking up from his paper to watch how they are\\ngetting on at the table). are you sure i can't help you in any\\nway, bluntschli?\\n\\nbluntschli (without interrupting his writing or looking up).\\nquite sure, thank you. saranoff and i will manage it.\\n\\nsergius (grimly). yes: we'll manage it. he finds out what to\\ndo; draws up the orders; and i sign 'em. division of labour,\\nmajor. (bluntschli passes him a paper.) another one? thank you.\\n(he plants the papers squarely before him; sets his chair\\ncarefully parallel to them; and signs with the air of a man\\nresolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat.) this hand\\nis more accustomed to the sword than to the pen.\\n\\npetkoff. it's very good of you, bluntschli, it is indeed, to let\\nyourself be put upon in this way. now are you quite sure i can\\ndo nothing?\\n\\ncatherine (in a low, warning tone). you can stop interrupting,\\npaul.\\n\\npetkoff (starting and looking round at her). eh? oh! quite\\nright, my love, quite right. (he takes his newspaper up, but\\nlets it drop again.) ah, you haven't been campaigning,\\ncatherine: you don't know how pleasant it is for us to sit here,\\nafter a good lunch, with nothing to do but enjoy ourselves.\\nthere's only one thing i want to make me thoroughly comfortable.\\n\\ncatherine. what is that?\\n\\npetkoff. my old coat. i'm not at home in this one: i feel as if\\ni were on parade.\\n\\ncatherine. my dear paul, how absurd you are about that old coat!\\nit must be hanging in the blue closet where you left it.\\n\\npetkoff. my dear catherine, i tell you i've looked there. am i\\nto believe my own eyes or not? (catherine quietly rises and\\npresses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace.) what\\nare you shewing off that bell for? (she looks at him majestically,\\nand silently resumes her chair and her needlework.) my dear: if\\nyou think the obstinacy of your sex can make a coat out of two\\nold dressing gowns of raina's, your waterproof, and my\\nmackintosh, you're mistaken. that's exactly what the blue closet\\ncontains at present. (nicola presents himself.)\\n\\ncatherine (unmoved by petkoff's sally). nicola: go to the blue\\ncloset and bring your master's old coat here--the braided one he\\nusually wears in the house.\\n\\nnicola. yes, madam. (nicola goes out.)\\n\\npetkoff. catherine.\\n\\ncatherine. yes, paul?\\n\\npetkoff. i bet you any piece of jewellery you like to order from\\nsofia against a week's housekeeping money, that the coat isn't\\nthere.\\n\\ncatherine. done, paul.\\n\\npetkoff (excited by the prospect of a gamble). come: here's an\\nopportunity for some sport. who'll bet on it? bluntschli: i'll\\ngive you six to one.\\n\\nbluntschli (imperturbably). it would be robbing you, major.\\nmadame is sure to be right. (without looking up, he passes\\nanother batch of papers to sergius.)\\n\\nsergius (also excited). bravo, switzerland! major: i bet my\\nbest charger against an arab mare for raina that nicola finds\\nthe coat in the blue closet.\\n\\npetkoff (eagerly). your best char--\\n\\ncatherine (hastily interrupting him). don't be foolish, paul.\\nan arabian mare will cost you 50,000 levas.\\n\\nraina (suddenly coming out of her picturesque revery). really,\\nmother, if you are going to take the jewellery, i don't see why\\nyou should grudge me my arab.\\n\\n   (nicola comes back with the coat and brings it\\n    to petkoff, who can hardly believe his eyes.)\\n\\ncatherine. where was it, nicola?\\n\\nnicola. hanging in the blue closet, madam.\\n\\npetkoff. well, i am d--\\n\\ncatherine (stopping him). paul!\\n\\npetkoff. i could have sworn it wasn't there. age is beginning to\\ntell on me. i'm getting hallucinations. (to nicola.) here: help\\nme to change. excuse me, bluntschli. (he begins changing coats,\\nnicola acting as valet.) remember: i didn't take that bet of\\nyours, sergius. you'd better give raina that arab steed\\nyourself, since you've roused her expectations. eh, raina? (he\\nlooks round at her; but she is again rapt in the landscape. with\\na little gush of paternal affection and pride, he points her out\\nto them and says) she's dreaming, as usual.\\n\\nsergius. assuredly she shall not be the loser.\\n\\npetkoff. so much the better for her. i shan't come off so cheap,\\ni expect. (the change is now complete. nicola goes out with the\\ndiscarded coat.) ah, now i feel at home at last. (he sits down\\nand takes his newspaper with a grunt of relief.)\\n\\nbluntschli (to sergius, handing a paper). that's the last\\norder.\\n\\npetkoff (jumping up). what! finished?\\n\\nbluntschli. finished. (petkoff goes beside sergius; looks\\ncuriously over his left shoulder as he signs; and says with\\nchildlike envy) haven't you anything for me to sign?\\n\\nbluntschli. not necessary. his signature will do.\\n\\npetkoff. ah, well, i think we've done a thundering good day's\\nwork. (he goes away from the table.) can i do anything more?\\n\\nbluntschli. you had better both see the fellows that are to take\\nthese. (to sergius.) pack them off at once; and shew them that\\ni've marked on the orders the time they should hand them in by.\\ntell them that if they stop to drink or tell stories--if they're\\nfive minutes late, they'll have the skin taken off their backs.\\n\\nsergius (rising indignantly). i'll say so. and if one of them\\nis man enough to spit in my face for insulting him, i'll buy his\\ndischarge and give him a pension. (he strides out, his humanity\\ndeeply outraged.)\\n\\nbluntschli (confidentially). just see that he talks to them\\nproperly, major, will you?\\n\\npetkoff (officiously). quite right, bluntschli, quite right.\\ni'll see to it. (he goes to the door importantly, but hesitates\\non the threshold.) by the bye, catherine, you may as well come,\\ntoo. they'll be far more frightened of you than of me.\\n\\ncatherine (putting down her embroidery). i daresay i had\\nbetter. you will only splutter at them. (she goes out, petkoff\\nholding the door for her and following her.)\\n\\nbluntschli. what a country! they make cannons out of cherry\\ntrees; and the officers send for their wives to keep discipline!\\n(he begins to fold and docket the papers. raina, who has risen\\nfrom the divan, strolls down the room with her hands clasped\\nbehind her, and looks mischievously at him.)\\n\\nraina. you look ever so much nicer than when we last met. (he\\nlooks up, surprised.) what have you done to yourself?\\n\\nbluntschli. washed; brushed; good night's sleep and breakfast.\\nthat's all.\\n\\nraina. did you get back safely that morning?\\n\\nbluntschli. quite, thanks.\\n\\nraina. were they angry with you for running away from sergius's\\ncharge?\\n\\nbluntschli. no, they were glad; because they'd all just run away\\nthemselves.\\n\\nraina (going to the table, and leaning over it towards him). it\\nmust have made a lovely story for them--all that about me and my\\nroom.\\n\\nbluntschli. capital story. but i only told it to one of them--a\\nparticular friend.\\n\\nraina. on whose discretion you could absolutely rely?\\n\\nbluntschli. absolutely.\\n\\nraina. hm! he told it all to my father and sergius the day you\\nexchanged the prisoners. (she turns away and strolls carelessly\\nacross to the other side of the room.)\\n\\nbluntschli (deeply concerned and half incredulous). no! you\\ndon't mean that, do you?\\n\\nraina (turning, with sudden earnestness). i do indeed. but they\\ndon't know that it was in this house that you hid. if sergius\\nknew, he would challenge you and kill you in a duel.\\n\\nbluntschli. bless me! then don't tell him.\\n\\nraina (full of reproach for his levity). can you realize what\\nit is to me to deceive him? i want to be quite perfect with\\nsergius--no meanness, no smallness, no deceit. my relation to\\nhim is the one really beautiful and noble part of my life. i\\nhope you can understand that.\\n\\nbluntschli (sceptically). you mean that you wouldn't like him\\nto find out that the story about the ice pudding was\\na--a--a--you know.\\n\\nraina (wincing). ah, don't talk of it in that flippant way. i\\nlied: i know it. but i did it to save your life. he would have\\nkilled you. that was the second time i ever uttered a falsehood.\\n(bluntschli rises quickly and looks doubtfully and somewhat\\nseverely at her.) do you remember the first time?\\n\\nbluntschli. i! no. was i present?\\n\\nraina. yes; and i told the officer who was searching for you\\nthat you were not present.\\n\\nbluntschli. true. i should have remembered it.\\n\\nraina (greatly encouraged). ah, it is natural that you should\\nforget it first. it cost you nothing: it cost me a lie!--a lie!!\\n(she sits down on the ottoman, looking straight before her with\\nher hands clasped on her knee. bluntschli, quite touched, goes\\nto the ottoman with a particularly reassuring and considerate\\nair, and sits down beside her.)\\n\\nbluntschli. my dear young lady, don't let this worry you.\\nremember: i'm a soldier. now what are the two things that happen\\nto a soldier so often that he comes to think nothing of them?\\none is hearing people tell lies (raina recoils): the other is\\ngetting his life saved in all sorts of ways by all sorts of\\npeople.\\n\\nraina (rising in indignant protest). and so he becomes a\\ncreature incapable of faith and of gratitude.\\n\\nbluntschli (making a wry face). do you like gratitude? i don't.\\nif pity is akin to love, gratitude is akin to the other thing.\\n\\nraina. gratitude! (turning on him.) if you are incapable of\\ngratitude you are incapable of any noble sentiment. even animals\\nare grateful. oh, i see now exactly what you think of me! you\\nwere not surprised to hear me lie. to you it was something i\\nprobably did every day--every hour. that is how men think of\\nwomen. (she walks up the room melodramatically.)\\n\\nbluntschli (dubiously). there's reason in everything. you said\\nyou'd told only two lies in your whole life. dear young lady:\\nisn't that rather a short allowance? i'm quite a straightforward\\nman myself; but it wouldn't last me a whole morning.\\n\\nraina (staring haughtily at him). do you know, sir, that you\\nare insulting me?\\n\\nbluntschli. i can't help it. when you get into that noble\\nattitude and speak in that thrilling voice, i admire you; but i\\nfind it impossible to believe a single word you say.\\n\\nraina (superbly). captain bluntschli!\\n\\nbluntschli (unmoved). yes?\\n\\nraina (coming a little towards him, as if she could not believe\\nher senses). do you mean what you said just now? do you know\\nwhat you said just now?\\n\\nbluntschli. i do.\\n\\nraina (gasping). i! i!!! (she points to herself incredulously,\\nmeaning \\\"i, raina petkoff, tell lies!\\\" he meets her gaze\\nunflinchingly. she suddenly sits down beside him, and adds, with\\na complete change of manner from the heroic to the familiar) how\\ndid you find me out?\\n\\nbluntschli (promptly). instinct, dear young lady. instinct, and\\nexperience of the world.\\n\\nraina (wonderingly). do you know, you are the first man i ever\\nmet who did not take me seriously?\\n\\nbluntschli. you mean, don't you, that i am the first man that\\nhas ever taken you quite seriously?\\n\\nraina. yes, i suppose i do mean that. (cosily, quite at her ease\\nwith him.) how strange it is to be talked to in such a way! you\\nknow, i've always gone on like that--i mean the noble attitude\\nand the thrilling voice. i did it when i was a tiny child to my\\nnurse. she believed in it. i do it before my parents. they\\nbelieve in it. i do it before sergius. he believes in it.\\n\\nbluntschli. yes: he's a little in that line himself, isn't he?\\n\\nraina (startled). do you think so?\\n\\nbluntschli. you know him better than i do.\\n\\nraina. i wonder--i wonder is he? if i thought that--!\\n(discouraged.) ah, well, what does it matter? i suppose, now\\nthat you've found me out, you despise me.\\n\\nbluntschli (warmly, rising). no, my dear young lady, no, no, no\\na thousand times. it's part of your youth--part of your charm.\\ni'm like all the rest of them--the nurse--your\\nparents--sergius: i'm your infatuated admirer.\\n\\nraina (pleased). really?\\n\\nbluntschli (slapping his breast smartly with his hand, german\\nfashion). hand aufs herz! really and truly.\\n\\nraina (very happy). but what did you think of me for giving you\\nmy portrait?\\n\\nbluntschli (astonished). your portrait! you never gave me your\\nportrait.\\n\\nraina (quickly). do you mean to say you never got it?\\n\\nbluntschli. no. (he sits down beside her, with renewed interest,\\nand says, with some complacency.) when did you send it to me?\\n\\nraina (indignantly). i did not send it to you. (she turns her\\nhead away, and adds, reluctantly.) it was in the pocket of that\\ncoat.\\n\\nbluntschli (pursing his lips and rounding his eyes). oh-o-oh! i\\nnever found it. it must be there still.\\n\\nraina (springing up). there still!--for my father to find the\\nfirst time he puts his hand in his pocket! oh, how could you be\\nso stupid?\\n\\nbluntschli (rising also). it doesn't matter: it's only a\\nphotograph: how can he tell who it was intended for? tell him he\\nput it there himself.\\n\\nraina (impatiently). yes, that is so clever--so clever! what\\nshall i do?\\n\\nbluntschli. ah, i see. you wrote something on it. that was rash!\\n\\nraina (annoyed almost to tears). oh, to have done such a thing\\nfor you, who care no more--except to laugh at me--oh! are you\\nsure nobody has touched it?\\n\\nbluntschli. well, i can't be quite sure. you see i couldn't\\ncarry it about with me all the time: one can't take much luggage\\non active service.\\n\\nraina. what did you do with it?\\n\\nbluntschli. when i got through to peerot i had to put it in safe\\nkeeping somehow. i thought of the railway cloak room; but that's\\nthe surest place to get looted in modern warfare. so i pawned\\nit.\\n\\nraina. pawned it!!!\\n\\nbluntschli. i know it doesn't sound nice; but it was much the\\nsafest plan. i redeemed it the day before yesterday. heaven only\\nknows whether the pawnbroker cleared out the pockets or not.\\n\\nraina (furious--throwing the words right into his face). you\\nhave a low, shopkeeping mind. you think of things that would\\nnever come into a gentleman's head.\\n\\nbluntschli (phlegmatically). that's the swiss national\\ncharacter, dear lady.\\n\\nraina. oh, i wish i had never met you. (she flounces away and\\nsits at the window fuming.)\\n\\n   (louka comes in with a heap of letters and\\n    telegrams on her salver, and crosses, with her\\n    bold, free gait, to the table. her left sleeve is\\n    looped up to the shoulder with a brooch, shewing\\n    her naked arm, with a broad gilt bracelet covering\\n    the bruise.)\\n\\nlouka (to bluntschli). for you. (she empties the salver\\nrecklessly on the table.) the messenger is waiting. (she is\\ndetermined not to be civil to a servian, even if she must bring\\nhim his letters.)\\n\\nbluntschli (to raina). will you excuse me: the last postal\\ndelivery that reached me was three weeks ago. these are the\\nsubsequent accumulations. four telegrams--a week old. (he opens\\none.) oho! bad news!\\n\\nraina (rising and advancing a little remorsefully). bad news?\\n\\nbluntschli. my father's dead. (he looks at the telegram with his\\nlips pursed, musing on the unexpected change in his\\narrangements.)\\n\\nraina. oh, how very sad!\\n\\nbluntschli. yes: i shall have to start for home in an hour. he\\nhas left a lot of big hotels behind him to be looked after.\\n(takes up a heavy letter in a long blue envelope.) here's a\\nwhacking letter from the family solicitor. (he pulls out the\\nenclosures and glances over them.) great heavens! seventy! two\\nhundred! (in a crescendo of dismay.) four hundred! four\\nthousand!! nine thousand six hundred!!! what on earth shall i do\\nwith them all?\\n\\nraina (timidly). nine thousand hotels?\\n\\nbluntschli. hotels! nonsense. if you only knew!--oh, it's too\\nridiculous! excuse me: i must give my fellow orders about\\nstarting. (he leaves the room hastily, with the documents in his\\nhand.)\\n\\nlouka (tauntingly). he has not much heart, that swiss, though\\nhe is so fond of the servians. he has not a word of grief for\\nhis poor father.\\n\\nraina (bitterly). grief!--a man who has been doing nothing but\\nkilling people for years! what does he care? what does any\\nsoldier care? (she goes to the door, evidently restraining her\\ntears with difficulty.)\\n\\nlouka. major saranoff has been fighting, too; and he has plenty\\nof heart left. (raina, at the door, looks haughtily at her and\\ngoes out.) aha! i thought you wouldn't get much feeling out of\\nyour soldier. (she is following raina when nicola enters with an\\narmful of logs for the fire.)\\n\\nnicola (grinning amorously at her). i've been trying all the\\nafternoon to get a minute alone with you, my girl. (his\\ncountenance changes as he notices her arm.) why, what fashion is\\nthat of wearing your sleeve, child?\\n\\nlouka (proudly). my own fashion.\\n\\nnicola. indeed! if the mistress catches you, she'll talk to you.\\n(he throws the logs down on the ottoman, and sits comfortably\\nbeside them.)\\n\\nlouka. is that any reason why you should take it on yourself to\\ntalk to me?\\n\\nnicola. come: don't be so contrary with me. i've some good news\\nfor you. (he takes out some paper money. louka, with an eager\\ngleam in her eyes, comes close to look at it.) see, a twenty\\nleva bill! sergius gave me that out of pure swagger. a fool and\\nhis money are soon parted. there's ten levas more. the swiss\\ngave me that for backing up the mistress's and raina's lies\\nabout him. he's no fool, he isn't. you should have heard old\\ncatherine downstairs as polite as you please to me, telling me\\nnot to mind the major being a little impatient; for they knew\\nwhat a good servant i was--after making a fool and a liar of me\\nbefore them all! the twenty will go to our savings; and you\\nshall have the ten to spend if you'll only talk to me so as to\\nremind me i'm a human being. i get tired of being a servant\\noccasionally.\\n\\nlouka (scornfully). yes: sell your manhood for thirty levas,\\nand buy me for ten! keep your money. you were born to be a\\nservant. i was not. when you set up your shop you will only be\\neverybody's servant instead of somebody's servant.\\n\\nnicola (picking up his logs, and going to the stove). ah, wait\\ntill you see. we shall have our evenings to ourselves; and i\\nshall be master in my own house, i promise you. (he throws the\\nlogs down and kneels at the stove.)\\n\\nlouka. you shall never be master in mine. (she sits down on\\nsergius's chair.)\\n\\nnicola (turning, still on his knees, and squatting down rather\\nforlornly, on his calves, daunted by her implacable disdain).\\nyou have a great ambition in you, louka. remember: if any luck\\ncomes to you, it was i that made a woman of you.\\n\\nlouka. you!\\n\\nnicola (with dogged self-assertion). yes, me. who was it made\\nyou give up wearing a couple of pounds of false black hair on\\nyour head and reddening your lips and cheeks like any other\\nbulgarian girl? i did. who taught you to trim your nails, and\\nkeep your hands clean, and be dainty about yourself, like a fine\\nrussian lady? me! do you hear that? me! (she tosses her head\\ndefiantly; and he rises, ill-humoredly, adding more coolly) i've\\noften thought that if raina were out of the way, and you just a\\nlittle less of a fool and sergius just a little more of one, you\\nmight come to be one of my grandest customers, instead of only\\nbeing my wife and costing me money.\\n\\nlouka. i believe you would rather be my servant than my husband.\\nyou would make more out of me. oh, i know that soul of yours.\\n\\nnicola (going up close to her for greater emphasis). never you\\nmind my soul; but just listen to my advice. if you want to be a\\nlady, your present behaviour to me won't do at all, unless when\\nwe're alone. it's too sharp and impudent; and impudence is a\\nsort of familiarity: it shews affection for me. and don't you\\ntry being high and mighty with me either. you're like all\\ncountry girls: you think it's genteel to treat a servant the way\\ni treat a stable-boy. that's only your ignorance; and don't you\\nforget it. and don't be so ready to defy everybody. act as if\\nyou expected to have your own way, not as if you expected to be\\nordered about. the way to get on as a lady is the same as the\\nway to get on as a servant: you've got to know your place;\\nthat's the secret of it. and you may depend on me to know my\\nplace if you get promoted. think over it, my girl. i'll stand by\\nyou: one servant should always stand by another.\\n\\nlouka (rising impatiently). oh, i must behave in my own way.\\nyou take all the courage out of me with your cold-blooded\\nwisdom. go and put those logs on the fire: that's the sort of\\nthing you understand. (before nicola can retort, sergius comes\\nin. he checks himself a moment on seeing louka; then goes to the\\nstove.)\\n\\nsergius (to nicola). i am not in the way of your work, i hope.\\n\\nnicola (in a smooth, elderly manner). oh, no, sir, thank you\\nkindly. i was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit\\nof running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance, to\\nlook at the books. that's the worst of her education, sir: it\\ngives her habits above her station. (to louka.) make that table\\ntidy, louka, for the major. (he goes out sedately.)\\n\\n    (louka, without looking at sergius, begins to\\n     arrange the papers on the table. he crosses slowly\\n     to her, and studies the arrangement of her sleeve\\n     reflectively.)\\n\\nsergius. let me see: is there a mark there? (he turns up the\\nbracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp. she stands\\nmotionless, not looking at him: fascinated, but on her guard.)\\nffff! does it hurt?\\n\\nlouka. yes.\\n\\nsergius. shall i cure it?\\n\\nlouka (instantly withdrawing herself proudly, but still not\\nlooking at him). no. you cannot cure it now.\\n\\nsergius (masterfully). quite sure? (he makes a movement as if\\nto take her in his arms.)\\n\\nlouka. don't trifle with me, please. an officer should not\\ntrifle with a servant.\\n\\nsergius (touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his\\nforefinger). that was no trifle, louka.\\n\\nlouka. no. (looking at him for the first time.) are you sorry?\\n\\nsergius (with measured emphasis, folding his arms). i am never\\nsorry.\\n\\nlouka (wistfully). i wish i could believe a man could be so\\nunlike a woman as that. i wonder are you really a brave man?\\n\\nsergius (unaffectedly, relaxing his attitude). yes: i am a\\nbrave man. my heart jumped like a woman's at the first shot; but\\nin the charge i found that i was brave. yes: that at least is\\nreal about me.\\n\\nlouka. did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are\\npoor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich\\nlike you?\\n\\nsergius (with bitter levity.) not a bit. they all slashed and\\ncursed and yelled like heroes. psha! the courage to rage and\\nkill is cheap. i have an english bull terrier who has as much of\\nthat sort of courage as the whole bulgarian nation, and the\\nwhole russian nation at its back. but he lets my groom thrash\\nhim, all the same. that's your soldier all over! no, louka, your\\npoor men can cut throats; but they are afraid of their officers;\\nthey put up with insults and blows; they stand by and see one\\nanother punished like children---aye, and help to do it when\\nthey are ordered. and the officers!---well (with a short, bitter\\nlaugh) i am an officer. oh, (fervently) give me the man who will\\ndefy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets\\nitself up against his own will and conscience: he alone is the\\nbrave man.\\n\\nlouka. how easy it is to talk! men never seem to me to grow up:\\nthey all have schoolboy's ideas. you don't know what true\\ncourage is.\\n\\nsergius (ironically). indeed! i am willing to be instructed.\\n\\nlouka. look at me! how much am i allowed to have my own will? i\\nhave to get your room ready for you--to sweep and dust, to fetch\\nand carry. how could that degrade me if it did not degrade you\\nto have it done for you? but (with subdued passion) if i were\\nempress of russia, above everyone in the world, then--ah, then,\\nthough according to you i could shew no courage at all; you\\nshould see, you should see.\\n\\nsergius. what would you do, most noble empress?\\n\\nlouka. i would marry the man i loved, which no other queen in\\neurope has the courage to do. if i loved you, though you would\\nbe as far beneath me as i am beneath you, i would dare to be the\\nequal of my inferior. would you dare as much if you loved me?\\nno: if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let\\nit grow. you dare not: you would marry a rich man's daughter\\nbecause you would be afraid of what other people would say of\\nyou.\\n\\nsergius (carried away). you lie: it is not so, by all the\\nstars! if i loved you, and i were the czar himself, i would set\\nyou on the throne by my side. you know that i love another\\nwoman, a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth. and\\nyou are jealous of her.\\n\\nlouka. i have no reason to be. she will never marry you now. the\\nman i told you of has come back. she will marry the swiss.\\n\\nsergius (recoiling). the swiss!\\n\\nlouka. a man worth ten of you. then you can come to me; and i\\nwill refuse you. you are not good enough for me. (she turns to\\nthe door.)\\n\\nsergius (springing after her and catching her fiercely in his\\narms). i will kill the swiss; and afterwards i will do as i\\nplease with you.\\n\\nlouka (in his arms, passive and steadfast). the swiss will kill\\nyou, perhaps. he has beaten you in love. he may beat you in war.\\n\\nsergius (tormentedly). do you think i believe that she--she!\\nwhose worst thoughts are higher than your best ones, is capable\\nof trifling with another man behind my back?\\n\\nlouka. do you think she would believe the swiss if he told her\\nnow that i am in your arms?\\n\\nsergius (releasing her in despair). damnation! oh, damnation!\\nmockery, mockery everywhere: everything i think is mocked by\\neverything i do. (he strikes himself frantically on the breast.)\\ncoward, liar, fool! shall i kill myself like a man, or live and\\npretend to laugh at myself? (she again turns to go.) louka! (she\\nstops near the door.) remember: you belong to me.\\n\\nlouka (quietly). what does that mean--an insult?\\n\\nsergius (commandingly). it means that you love me, and that i\\nhave had you here in my arms, and will perhaps have you there\\nagain. whether that is an insult i neither know nor care: take\\nit as you please. but (vehemently) i will not be a coward and a\\ntrifler. if i choose to love you, i dare marry you, in spite of\\nall bulgaria. if these hands ever touch you again, they shall\\ntouch my affianced bride.\\n\\nlouka. we shall see whether you dare keep your word. but take\\ncare. i will not wait long.\\n\\nsergius (again folding his arms and standing motionless in the\\nmiddle of the room). yes, we shall see. and you shall wait my\\npleasure.\\n\\n   (bluntschli, much preoccupied, with his papers\\n    still in his hand, enters, leaving the door open\\n    for louka to go out. he goes across to the table,\\n    glancing at her as he passes. sergius, without\\n    altering his resolute attitude, watches him\\n    steadily. louka goes out, leaving the door open.)\\n\\nbluntschli (absently, sitting at the table as before, and\\nputting down his papers). that's a remarkable looking young\\nwoman.\\n\\nsergius (gravely, without moving). captain bluntschli.\\n\\nbluntschli. eh?\\n\\nsergius. you have deceived me. you are my rival. i brook no\\nrivals. at six o'clock i shall be in the drilling-ground on the\\nklissoura road, alone, on horseback, with my sabre. do you\\nunderstand?\\n\\nbluntschli (staring, but sitting quite at his ease). oh, thank\\nyou: that's a cavalry man's proposal. i'm in the artillery; and\\ni have the choice of weapons. if i go, i shall take a machine\\ngun. and there shall be no mistake about the cartridges this\\ntime.\\n\\nsergius (flushing, but with deadly coldness). take care, sir.\\nit is not our custom in bulgaria to allow invitations of that\\nkind to be trifled with.\\n\\nbluntschli (warmly). pooh! don't talk to me about bulgaria. you\\ndon't know what fighting is. but have it your own way. bring\\nyour sabre along. i'll meet you.\\n\\nsergius (fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of\\nspirit). well said, switzer. shall i lend you my best horse?\\n\\nbluntschli. no: damn your horse!---thank you all the same, my\\ndear fellow. (raina comes in, and hears the next sentence.) i\\nshall fight you on foot. horseback's too dangerous: i don't want\\nto kill you if i can help it.\\n\\nraina (hurrying forward anxiously). i have heard what captain\\nbluntschli said, sergius. you are going to fight. why? (sergius\\nturns away in silence, and goes to the stove, where he stands\\nwatching her as she continues, to bluntschli) what about?\\n\\nbluntschli. i don't know: he hasn't told me. better not\\ninterfere, dear young lady. no harm will be done: i've often\\nacted as sword instructor. he won't be able to touch me; and\\ni'll not hurt him. it will save explanations. in the morning i\\nshall be off home; and you'll never see me or hear of me again.\\nyou and he will then make it up and live happily ever after.\\n\\nraina (turning away deeply hurt, almost with a sob in her\\nvoice). i never said i wanted to see you again.\\n\\nsergius (striding forward). ha! that is a confession.\\n\\nraina (haughtily). what do you mean?\\n\\nsergius. you love that man!\\n\\nraina (scandalized). sergius!\\n\\nsergius. you allow him to make love to you behind my back, just\\nas you accept me as your affianced husband behind his.\\nbluntschli: you knew our relations; and you deceived me. it is\\nfor that that i call you to account, not for having received\\nfavours that i never enjoyed.\\n\\nbluntschli (jumping up indignantly). stuff! rubbish! i have\\nreceived no favours. why, the young lady doesn't even know\\nwhether i'm married or not.\\n\\nraina (forgetting herself). oh! (collapsing on the ottoman.)\\nare you?\\n\\nsergius. you see the young lady's concern, captain bluntschli.\\ndenial is useless. you have enjoyed the privilege of being\\nreceived in her own room, late at night--\\n\\nbluntschli (interrupting him pepperily). yes; you blockhead!\\nshe received me with a pistol at her head. your cavalry were at\\nmy heels. i'd have blown out her brains if she'd uttered a cry.\\n\\nsergius (taken aback). bluntschli! raina: is this true?\\n\\nraina (rising in wrathful majesty). oh, how dare you, how dare\\nyou?\\n\\nbluntschli. apologize, man, apologize! (he resumes his seat at\\nthe table.)\\n\\nsergius (with the old measured emphasis, folding his arms). i\\nnever apologize.\\n\\nraina (passionately). this is the doing of that friend of\\nyours, captain bluntschli. it is he who is spreading this\\nhorrible story about me. (she walks about excitedly.)\\n\\nbluntschli. no: he's dead--burnt alive.\\n\\nraina (stopping, shocked). burnt alive!\\n\\nbluntschli. shot in the hip in a wood yard. couldn't drag\\nhimself out. your fellows' shells set the timber on fire and\\nburnt him, with half a dozen other poor devils in the same\\npredicament.\\n\\nraina. how horrible!\\n\\nsergius. and how ridiculous! oh, war! war! the dream of patriots\\nand heroes! a fraud, bluntschli, a hollow sham, like love.\\n\\nraina (outraged). like love! you say that before me.\\n\\nbluntschli. come, saranoff: that matter is explained.\\n\\nsergius. a hollow sham, i say. would you have come back here if\\nnothing had passed between you, except at the muzzle of your\\npistol? raina is mistaken about our friend who was burnt. he was\\nnot my informant.\\n\\nraina. who then? (suddenly guessing the truth.) ah, louka! my\\nmaid, my servant! you were with her this morning all that time\\nafter---after---oh, what sort of god is this i have been\\nworshipping! (he meets her gaze with sardonic enjoyment of her\\ndisenchantment. angered all the more, she goes closer to him,\\nand says, in a lower, intenser tone) do you know that i looked\\nout of the window as i went upstairs, to have another sight of\\nmy hero; and i saw something that i did not understand then. i\\nknow now that you were making love to her.\\n\\nsergius (with grim humor). you saw that?\\n\\nraina. only too well. (she turns away, and throws herself on the\\ndivan under the centre window, quite overcome.)\\n\\nsergius (cynically). raina: our romance is shattered. life's a\\nfarce.\\n\\nbluntschli (to raina, goodhumoredly). you see: he's found\\nhimself out now.\\n\\nsergius. bluntschli: i have allowed you to call me a blockhead.\\nyou may now call me a coward as well. i refuse to fight you. do\\nyou know why?\\n\\nbluntschli. no; but it doesn't matter. i didn't ask the reason\\nwhen you cried on; and i don't ask the reason now that you cry\\noff. i'm a professional soldier. i fight when i have to, and am\\nvery glad to get out of it when i haven't to. you're only an\\namateur: you think fighting's an amusement.\\n\\nsergius. you shall hear the reason all the same, my\\nprofessional. the reason is that it takes two men--real men--men\\nof heart, blood and honor--to make a genuine combat. i could no\\nmore fight with you than i could make love to an ugly woman.\\nyou've no magnetism: you're not a man, you're a machine.\\n\\nbluntschli (apologetically). quite true, quite true. i always\\nwas that sort of chap. i'm very sorry. but now that you've found\\nthat life isn't a farce, but something quite sensible and\\nserious, what further obstacle is there to your happiness?\\n\\nraina (riling). you are very solicitous about my happiness and\\nhis. do you forget his new love--louka? it is not you that he\\nmust fight now, but his rival, nicola.\\n\\nsergius. rival!! (striking his forehead.)\\n\\nraina. did you not know that they are engaged?\\n\\nsergius. nicola! are fresh abysses opening! nicola!!\\n\\nraina (sarcastically). a shocking sacrifice, isn't it? such\\nbeauty, such intellect, such modesty, wasted on a middle-aged\\nservant man! really, sergius, you cannot stand by and allow such\\na thing. it would be unworthy of your chivalry.\\n\\nsergius (losing all self-control). viper! viper! (he rushes to\\nand fro, raging.)\\n\\nbluntschli. look here, saranoff; you're getting the worst of\\nthis.\\n\\nraina (getting angrier). do you realize what he has done,\\ncaptain bluntschli? he has set this girl as a spy on us; and her\\nreward is that he makes love to her.\\n\\nsergius. false! monstrous!\\n\\nraina. monstrous! (confronting him.) do you deny that she told\\nyou about captain bluntschli being in my room?\\n\\nsergius. no; but--\\n\\nraina (interrupting). do you deny that you were making love to\\nher when she told you?\\n\\nsergius. no; but i tell you--\\n\\nraina (cutting him short contemptuously). it is unnecessary to\\ntell us anything more. that is quite enough for us. (she turns\\nher back on him and sweeps majestically back to the window.)\\n\\nbluntschli (quietly, as sergius, in an agony of mortification,\\nsinks on the ottoman, clutching his averted head between his\\nfists). i told you you were getting the worst of it, saranoff.\\n\\nsergius. tiger cat!\\n\\nraina (running excitedly to bluntschli). you hear this man\\ncalling me names, captain bluntschli?\\n\\nbluntschli. what else can he do, dear lady? he must defend\\nhimself somehow. come (very persuasively), don't quarrel. what\\ngood does it do? (raina, with a gasp, sits down on the ottoman,\\nand after a vain effort to look vexedly at bluntschli, she falls\\na victim to her sense of humor, and is attacked with a\\ndisposition to laugh.)\\n\\nsergius. engaged to nicola! (he rises.) ha! ha! (going to the\\nstove and standing with his back to it.) ah, well, bluntschli,\\nyou are right to take this huge imposture of a world coolly.\\n\\nraina (to bluntschli with an intuitive guess at his state of\\nmind). i daresay you think us a couple of grown up babies, don't\\nyou?\\n\\nsergius (grinning a little). he does, he does. swiss\\ncivilization nursetending bulgarian barbarism, eh?\\n\\nbluntschli (blushing). not at all, i assure you. i'm only very\\nglad to get you two quieted. there now, let's be pleasant and\\ntalk it over in a friendly way. where is this other young lady?\\n\\nraina. listening at the door, probably.\\n\\nsergius (shivering as if a bullet had struck him, and speaking\\nwith quiet but deep indignation). i will prove that that, at\\nleast, is a calumny. (he goes with dignity to the door and opens\\nit. a yell of fury bursts from him as he looks out. he darts\\ninto the passage, and returns dragging in louka, whom he flings\\nagainst the table, r., as he cries) judge her, bluntschli--you,\\nthe moderate, cautious man: judge the eavesdropper.\\n\\n    (louka stands her ground, proud and silent.)\\n\\nbluntschli (shaking his head). i mustn't judge her. i once\\nlistened myself outside a tent when there was a mutiny brewing.\\nit's all a question of the degree of provocation. my life was at\\nstake.\\n\\nlouka. my love was at stake. (sergius flinches, ashamed of her\\nin spite of himself.) i am not ashamed.\\n\\nraina (contemptuously). your love! your curiosity, you mean.\\n\\nlouka (facing her and retorting her contempt with interest). my\\nlove, stronger than anything you can feel, even for your\\nchocolate cream soldier.\\n\\nsergius (with quick suspicion--to louka). what does that mean?\\n\\nlouka (fiercely). it means--\\n\\nsergius (interrupting her slightingly). oh, i remember, the ice\\npudding. a paltry taunt, girl.\\n\\n    (major petkoff enters, in his shirtsleeves.)\\n\\npetkoff. excuse my shirtsleeves, gentlemen. raina: somebody has\\nbeen wearing that coat of mine: i'll swear it--somebody with\\nbigger shoulders than mine. it's all burst open at the back.\\nyour mother is mending it. i wish she'd make haste. i shall\\ncatch cold. (he looks more attentively at them.) is anything the\\nmatter?\\n\\nraina. no. (she sits down at the stove with a tranquil air.)\\n\\nsergius. oh, no! (he sits down at the end of the table, as at\\nfirst.)\\n\\nbluntschli (who is already seated). nothing, nothing.\\n\\npetkoff (sitting down on the ottoman in his old place). that's\\nall right. (he notices louka.) anything the matter, louka?\\n\\nlouka. no, sir.\\n\\npetkoff (genially). that's all right. (he sneezes.) go and ask\\nyour mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (she\\nturns to obey; but nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a\\npretence of having business in the room by taking the little\\ntable with the hookah away to the wall near the windows.)\\n\\nraina (rising quickly, as she sees the coat on nicola's arm).\\nhere it is, papa. give it to me, nicola; and do you put some\\nmore wood on the fire. (she takes the coat, and brings it to the\\nmajor, who stands up to put it on. nicola attends to the fire.)\\n\\npetkoff (to raina, teasing her affectionately). aha! going to\\nbe very good to poor old papa just for one day after his return\\nfrom the wars, eh?\\n\\nraina (with solemn reproach). ah, how can you say that to me,\\nfather?\\n\\npetkoff. well, well, only a joke, little one. come, give me a\\nkiss. (she kisses him.) now give me the coat.\\n\\nraina. now, i am going to put it on for you. turn your back. (he\\nturns his back and feels behind him with his arms for the\\nsleeves. she dexterously takes the photograph from the pocket\\nand throws it on the table before bluntschli, who covers it with\\na sheet of paper under the very nose of sergius, who looks on\\namazed, with his suspicions roused in the highest degree. she\\nthen helps petkoff on with his coat.) there, dear! now are you\\ncomfortable?\\n\\npetkoff. quite, little love. thanks. (he sits down; and raina\\nreturns to her seat near the stove.) oh, by the bye, i've found\\nsomething funny. what's the meaning of this? (he put his hand\\ninto the picked pocket.) eh? hallo! (he tries the other pocket.)\\nwell, i could have sworn--(much puzzled, he tries the breast\\npocket.) i wonder--(tries the original pocket.) where can\\nit--(a light flashes on him; he rises, exclaiming) your mother's\\ntaken it.\\n\\nraina (very red). taken what?\\n\\npetkoff. your photograph, with the inscription: \\\"raina, to her\\nchocolate cream soldier--a souvenir.\\\" now you know there's\\nsomething more in this than meets the eye; and i'm going to find\\nit out. (shouting) nicola!\\n\\nnicola (dropping a log, and turning). sir!\\n\\npetkoff. did you spoil any pastry of miss raina's this morning?\\n\\nnicola. you heard miss raina say that i did, sir.\\n\\npetkoff. i know that, you idiot. was it true?\\n\\nnicola. i am sure miss raina is incapable of saying anything\\nthat is not true, sir.\\n\\npetkoff. are you? then i'm not. (turning to the others.) come:\\ndo you think i don't see it all? (goes to sergius, and slaps him\\non the shoulder.) sergius: you're the chocolate cream soldier,\\naren't you?\\n\\nsergius (starting up). i! a chocolate cream soldier! certainly\\nnot.\\n\\npetkoff. not! (he looks at them. they are all very serious and\\nvery conscious.) do you mean to tell me that raina sends\\nphotographic souvenirs to other men?\\n\\nsergius (enigmatically). the world is not such an innocent\\nplace as we used to think, petkoff.\\n\\nbluntschli (rising). it's all right, major. i'm the chocolate\\ncream soldier. (petkoff and sergius are equally astonished.) the\\ngracious young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams\\nwhen i was starving--shall i ever forget their flavour! my late\\nfriend stolz told you the story at peerot. i was the fugitive.\\n\\npetkoff. you! (he gasps.) sergius: do you remember how those two\\nwomen went on this morning when we mentioned it? (sergius smiles\\ncynically. petkoff confronts raina severely.) you're a nice young\\nwoman, aren't you?\\n\\nraina (bitterly). major saranoff has changed his mind. and when\\ni wrote that on the photograph, i did not know that captain\\nbluntschli was married.\\n\\nbluntschli (much startled protesting vehemently). i'm not\\nmarried.\\n\\nraina (with deep reproach). you said you were.\\n\\nbluntschli. i did not. i positively did not. i never was married\\nin my life.\\n\\npetkoff (exasperated). raina: will you kindly inform me, if i\\nam not asking too much, which gentleman you are engaged to?\\n\\nraina. to neither of them. this young lady (introducing louka,\\nwho faces them all proudly) is the object of major saranoff's\\naffections at present.\\n\\npetkoff. louka! are you mad, sergius? why, this girl's engaged\\nto nicola.\\n\\nnicola (coming forward ). i beg your pardon, sir. there is a\\nmistake. louka is not engaged to me.\\n\\npetkoff. not engaged to you, you scoundrel! why, you had\\ntwenty-five levas from me on the day of your betrothal; and she\\nhad that gilt bracelet from miss raina.\\n\\nnicola (with cool unction). we gave it out so, sir. but it was\\nonly to give louka protection. she had a soul above her station;\\nand i have been no more than her confidential servant. i intend,\\nas you know, sir, to set up a shop later on in sofia; and i look\\nforward to her custom and recommendation should she marry into\\nthe nobility. (he goes out with impressive discretion, leaving\\nthem all staring after him.)\\n\\npetkoff (breaking the silence). well, i am---hm!\\n\\nsergius. this is either the finest heroism or the most crawling\\nbaseness. which is it, bluntschli?\\n\\nbluntschli. never mind whether it's heroism or baseness.\\nnicola's the ablest man i've met in bulgaria. i'll make him\\nmanager of a hotel if he can speak french and german.\\n\\nlouka (suddenly breaking out at sergius). i have been insulted\\nby everyone here. you set them the example. you owe me an\\napology. (sergius immediately, like a repeating clock of which\\nthe spring has been touched, begins to fold his arms.)\\n\\nbluntschli (before he can speak). it's no use. he never\\napologizes.\\n\\nlouka. not to you, his equal and his enemy. to me, his poor\\nservant, he will not refuse to apologize.\\n\\nsergius (approvingly). you are right. (he bends his knee in his\\ngrandest manner.) forgive me!\\n\\nlouka. i forgive you. (she timidly gives him her hand, which he\\nkisses.) that touch makes me your affianced wife.\\n\\nsergius (springing up). ah, i forgot that!\\n\\nlouka (coldly). you can withdraw if you like.\\n\\nsergius. withdraw! never! you belong to me! (he puts his arm\\nabout her and draws her to him.) (catherine comes in and finds\\nlouka in sergius's arms, and all the rest gazing at them in\\nbewildered astonishment.)\\n\\ncatherine. what does this mean? (sergius releases louka.)\\n\\npetkoff. well, my dear, it appears that sergius is going to\\nmarry louka instead of raina. (she is about to break out\\nindignantly at him: he stops her by exclaiming testily.) don't\\nblame me: i've nothing to do with it. (he retreats to the\\nstove.)\\n\\ncatherine. marry louka! sergius: you are bound by your word to\\nus!\\n\\nsergius (folding his arms). nothing binds me.\\n\\nbluntschli (much pleased by this piece of common sense).\\nsaranoff: your hand. my congratulations. these heroics of yours\\nhave their practical side after all. (to louka.) gracious young\\nlady: the best wishes of a good republican! (he kisses her hand,\\nto raina's great disgust.)\\n\\ncatherine (threateningly). louka: you have been telling\\nstories.\\n\\nlouka. i have done raina no harm.\\n\\ncatherine (haughtily). raina! (raina is equally indignant at\\nthe liberty.)\\n\\nlouka. i have a right to call her raina: she calls me louka. i\\ntold major saranoff she would never marry him if the swiss\\ngentleman came back.\\n\\nbluntschli (surprised). hallo!\\n\\nlouka (turning to raina). i thought you were fonder of him than\\nof sergius. you know best whether i was right.\\n\\nbluntschli. what nonsense! i assure you, my dear major, my dear\\nmadame, the gracious young lady simply saved my life, nothing\\nelse. she never cared two straws for me. why, bless my heart and\\nsoul, look at the young lady and look at me. she, rich, young,\\nbeautiful, with her imagination full of fairy princes and noble\\nnatures and cavalry charges and goodness knows what! and i, a\\ncommon-place swiss soldier who hardly knows what a decent life\\nis after fifteen years of barracks and battles--a vagabond--a\\nman who has spoiled all his chances in life through an incurably\\nromantic disposition--a man--\\n\\nsergius (starting as if a needle had pricked him and\\ninterrupting bluntschli in incredulous amazement). excuse me,\\nbluntschli: what did you say had spoiled your chances in life?\\n\\nbluntschli (promptly). an incurably romantic disposition. i ran\\naway from home twice when i was a boy. i went into the army\\ninstead of into my father's business. i climbed the balcony of\\nthis house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest\\ncellar. i came sneaking back here to have another look at the\\nyoung lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat\\nback--\\n\\npetkoff. my coat!\\n\\nbluntschli.--yes: that's the coat i mean--would have sent it\\nback and gone quietly home. do you suppose i am the sort of\\nfellow a young girl falls in love with? why, look at our ages!\\ni'm thirty-four: i don't suppose the young lady is much over\\nseventeen. (this estimate produces a marked sensation, all the\\nrest turning and staring at one another. he proceeds\\ninnocently.) all that adventure which was life or death to me,\\nwas only a schoolgirl's game to her--chocolate creams and hide\\nand seek. here's the proof! (he takes the photograph from the\\ntable.) now, i ask you, would a woman who took the affair\\nseriously have sent me this and written on it: \\\"raina, to her\\nchocolate cream soldier--a souvenir\\\"? (he exhibits the\\nphotograph triumphantly, as if it settled the matter beyond all\\npossibility of refutation.)\\n\\npetkoff. that's what i was looking for. how the deuce did it get\\nthere?\\n\\nbluntschli (to raina complacently). i have put everything\\nright, i hope, gracious young lady!\\n\\nraina (in uncontrollable vexation). i quite agree with your\\naccount of yourself. you are a romantic idiot. (bluntschli is\\nunspeakably taken aback.) next time i hope you will know the\\ndifference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of\\ntwenty-three.\\n\\nbluntschli (stupefied). twenty-three! (she snaps the photograph\\ncontemptuously from his hand; tears it across; and throws the\\npieces at his feet.)\\n\\nsergius (with grim enjoyment of bluntschli's discomfiture).\\nbluntschli: my one last belief is gone. your sagacity is a\\nfraud, like all the other things. you have less sense than even\\ni have.\\n\\nbluntschli (overwhelmed). twenty-three! twenty-three!! (he\\nconsiders.) hm! (swiftly making up his mind.) in that case,\\nmajor petkoff, i beg to propose formally to become a suitor for\\nyour daughter's hand, in place of major saranoff retired.\\n\\nraina. you dare!\\n\\nbluntschli. if you were twenty-three when you said those things\\nto me this afternoon, i shall take them seriously.\\n\\ncatherine (loftily polite). i doubt, sir, whether you quite\\nrealize either my daughter's position or that of major sergius\\nsaranoff, whose place you propose to take. the petkoffs and the\\nsaranoffs are known as the richest and most important families\\nin the country. our position is almost historical: we can go\\nback for nearly twenty years.\\n\\npetkoff. oh, never mind that, catherine. (to bluntschli.) we\\nshould be most happy, bluntschli, if it were only a question of\\nyour position; but hang it, you know, raina is accustomed to a\\nvery comfortable establishment. sergius keeps twenty horses.\\n\\nbluntschli. but what on earth is the use of twenty horses? why,\\nit's a circus.\\n\\ncatherine (severely). my daughter, sir, is accustomed to a\\nfirst-rate stable.\\n\\nraina. hush, mother, you're making me ridiculous.\\n\\nbluntschli. oh, well, if it comes to a question of an\\nestablishment, here goes! (he goes impetuously to the table and\\nseizes the papers in the blue envelope.) how many horses did you\\nsay?\\n\\nsergius. twenty, noble switzer!\\n\\nbluntschli. i have two hundred horses. (they are amazed.) how\\nmany carriages?\\n\\nsergius. three.\\n\\nbluntschli. i have seventy. twenty-four of them will hold twelve\\ninside, besides two on the box, without counting the driver and\\nconductor. how many tablecloths have you?\\n\\nsergius. how the deuce do i know?\\n\\nbluntschli. have you four thousand?\\n\\nsergius. no.\\n\\nbluntschli. i have. i have nine thousand six hundred pairs of\\nsheets and blankets, with two thousand four hundred eider-down\\nquilts. i have ten thousand knives and forks, and the same\\nquantity of dessert spoons. i have six hundred servants. i have\\nsix palatial establishments, besides two livery stables, a tea\\ngarden and a private house. i have four medals for distinguished\\nservices; i have the rank of an officer and the standing of a\\ngentleman; and i have three native languages. show me any man in\\nbulgaria that can offer as much.\\n\\npetkoff (with childish awe). are you emperor of switzerland?\\n\\nbluntschli. my rank is the highest known in switzerland: i'm a\\nfree citizen.\\n\\ncatherine. then captain bluntschli, since you are my daughter's\\nchoice, i shall not stand in the way of her happiness. (petkoff\\nis about to speak.) that is major petkoff's feeling also.\\n\\npetkoff. oh, i shall be only too glad. two hundred horses! whew!\\n\\nsergius. what says the lady?\\n\\nraina (pretending to sulk). the lady says that he can keep his\\ntablecloths and his omnibuses. i am not here to be sold to the\\nhighest bidder.\\n\\nbluntschli. i won't take that answer. i appealed to you as a\\nfugitive, a beggar, and a starving man. you accepted me. you\\ngave me your hand to kiss, your bed to sleep in, and your roof\\nto shelter me--\\n\\nraina (interrupting him). i did not give them to the emperor of\\nswitzerland!\\n\\nbluntschli. that's just what i say.

(detaining him.)  you shan't go.\\n\\ntony.  i will, i tell you.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  i say you shan't.\\n\\ntony.  we'll see which is strongest, you or i.  [exit, hauling her\\nout.]\\n\\nhardcastle.  (solus.)  ay, there goes a pair that only spoil each\\nother.  but is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and\\ndiscretion out of doors?  there's my pretty darling kate! the fashions\\nof the times have almost infected her too.  by living a year or two in\\ntown, she is as fond of gauze and french frippery as the best of them.\\n\\n\\nenter miss hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  blessings on my pretty innocence! drest out as usual, my\\nkate.  goodness!  what a quantity of superfluous silk hast thou got\\nabout thee, girl!  i could never teach the fools of this age, that the\\nindigent world could be clothed out of the trimmings of the vain.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  you know our agreement, sir.  you allow me the\\nmorning to receive and pay visits, and to dress in my own manner; and\\nin the evening i put on my housewife's dress to please you.\\n\\nhardcastle.  well, remember, i insist on the terms of our agreement;\\nand, by the bye, i believe i shall have occasion to try your obedience\\nthis very evening.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i protest, sir, i don't comprehend your meaning.\\n\\nhardcastle.  then to be plain with you, kate, i expect the young\\ngentleman i have chosen to be your husband from town this very day.  i\\nhave his father's letter, in which he informs me his son is set out,\\nand that he intends to follow himself shortly after.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  indeed!  i wish i had known something of this\\nbefore.  bless me, how shall i behave?  it's a thousand to one i\\nshan't like him; our meeting will be so formal, and so like a thing of\\nbusiness, that i shall find no room for friendship or esteem.\\n\\nhardcastle.  depend upon it, child, i'll never control your choice; but\\nmr. marlow, whom i have pitched upon, is the son of my old friend, sir\\ncharles marlow, of whom you have heard me talk so often.  the young\\ngentleman has been bred a scholar, and is designed for an employment in\\nthe service of his country.  i am told he's a man of an excellent\\nunderstanding.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  is he?\\n\\nhardcastle.  very generous.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i believe i shall like him.\\n\\nhardcastle.  young and brave.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i'm sure i shall like him.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and very handsome.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  my dear papa, say no more, (kissing his hand), he's\\nmine; i'll have him.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and, to crown all, kate, he's one of the most bashful and\\nreserved young fellows in all the world.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  eh! you have frozen me to death again.  that word\\nreserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments.  a reserved\\nlover, it is said, always makes a suspicious husband.\\n\\nhardcastle.  on the contrary, modesty seldom resides in a breast that\\nis not enriched with nobler virtues.  it was the very feature in his\\ncharacter that first struck me.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  he must have more striking features to catch me, i\\npromise you.  however, if he be so young, so handsome, and so\\neverything as you mention, i believe he'll do still.  i think i'll have\\nhim.\\n\\nhardcastle.  ay, kate, but there is still an obstacle.  it's more than\\nan even wager he may not have you.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  my dear papa, why will you mortify one so?--well, if\\nhe refuses, instead of breaking my heart at his indifference, i'll only\\nbreak my glass for its flattery, set my cap to some newer fashion, and\\nlook out for some less difficult admirer.\\n\\nhardcastle.  bravely resolved!  in the mean time i'll go prepare the\\nservants for his reception: as we seldom see company, they want as much\\ntraining as a company of recruits the first day's muster.  [exit.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (alone).  lud, this news of papa's puts me all in a\\nflutter.  young, handsome: these he put last; but i put them foremost.\\nsensible, good-natured; i like all that.  but then reserved and\\nsheepish; that's much against him.  yet can't he be cured of his\\ntimidity, by being taught to be proud of his wife?  yes, and can't\\ni--but i vow i'm disposing of the husband before i have secured the\\nlover.\\n\\n\\nenter miss neville.\\n\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i'm glad you're come, neville, my dear.  tell me,\\nconstance, how do i look this evening?  is there anything whimsical\\nabout me?  is it one of my well-looking days, child?  am i in face\\nto-day?\\n\\nmiss neville.  perfectly, my dear.  yet now i look again--bless\\nme!--sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold\\nfishes.  has your brother or the cat been meddling? or has the last\\nnovel been too moving?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  no; nothing of all this.  i have been threatened--i\\ncan scarce get it out--i have been threatened with a lover.\\n\\nmiss neville.  and his name--\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  is marlow.\\n\\nmiss neville.  indeed!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  the son of sir charles marlow.\\n\\nmiss neville.  as i live, the most intimate friend of mr. hastings, my\\nadmirer.  they are never asunder.  i believe you must have seen him\\nwhen we lived in town.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  never.\\n\\nmiss neville.  he's a very singular character, i assure you.  among\\nwomen of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive; but his\\nacquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of\\nanother stamp: you understand me.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  an odd character indeed.  i shall never be able to\\nmanage him.  what shall i do?  pshaw, think no more of him, but trust\\nto occurrences for success.  but how goes on your own affair, my dear?\\nhas my mother been courting you for my brother tony as usual?\\n\\nmiss neville.  i have just come from one of our agreeable\\ntete-a-tetes.  she has been saying a hundred tender things, and setting\\noff her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and her partiality is such, that she actually thinks\\nhim so.  a fortune like yours is no small temptation.  besides, as she\\nhas the sole management of it, i'm not surprised to see her unwilling\\nto let it go out of the family.\\n\\nmiss neville.  a fortune like mine, which chiefly consists in jewels,\\nis no such mighty temptation.  but at any rate, if my dear hastings be\\nbut constant, i make no doubt to be too hard for her at last.  however,\\ni let her suppose that i am in love with her son; and she never once\\ndreams that my affections are fixed upon another.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  my good brother holds out stoutly.  i could almost\\nlove him for hating you so.\\n\\nmiss neville.  it is a good-natured creature at bottom, and i'm sure\\nwould wish to see me married to anybody but himself.  but my aunt's\\nbell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements.  allons!\\ncourage is necessary, as our affairs are critical.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  \\\"would it were bed-time, and all were well.\\\"\\n[exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nscene--an alehouse room.  several shabby fellows with punch and\\ntobacco.  tony at the head of the table, a little higher than the\\nrest, a mallet in his hand.\\n\\n\\nomnes.  hurrea!

 my life has been chiefly\\nspent in a college or an inn, in seclusion from that lovely part of the\\ncreation that chiefly teach men confidence.  i don't know that i was\\never familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman--except my\\nmother--but among females of another class, you know----\\n\\nhastings.  ay, among them you are impudent enough of all conscience.\\n\\nmarlow.  they are of us, you know.\\n\\nhastings.  but in the company of women of reputation i never saw such\\nan idiot, such a trembler; you look for all the world as if you wanted\\nan opportunity of stealing out of the room.\\n\\nmarlow.  why, man, that's because i do want to steal out of the room.\\nfaith, i have often formed a resolution to break the ice, and rattle\\naway at any rate.  but i don't know how, a single glance from a pair of\\nfine eyes has totally overset my resolution.  an impudent fellow may\\ncounterfeit modesty; but i'll be hanged if a modest man can ever\\ncounterfeit impudence.\\n\\nhastings.  if you could but say half the fine things to them that i\\nhave heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn, or even a college\\nbed-maker----\\n\\nmarlow.  why, george, i can't say fine things to them; they freeze,\\nthey petrify me.  they may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain, or\\nsome such bagatelle; but, to me, a modest woman, drest out in all her\\nfinery, is the most tremendous object of the whole creation.\\n\\nhastings.  ha! ha! ha!  at this rate, man, how can you ever expect to\\nmarry?\\n\\nmarlow.  never; unless, as among kings and princes, my bride were to be\\ncourted by proxy.  if, indeed, like an eastern bridegroom, one were to\\nbe introduced to a wife he never saw before, it might be endured.  but\\nto go through all the terrors of a formal courtship, together with the\\nepisode of aunts, grandmothers, and cousins, and at last to blurt out\\nthe broad staring question of, madam, will you marry me?  no, no,\\nthat's a strain much above me, i assure you.\\n\\nhastings.  i pity you.  but how do you intend behaving to the lady you\\nare come down to visit at the request of your father?\\n\\nmarlow.  as i behave to all other ladies.  bow very low, answer yes or\\nno to all her demands--but for the rest, i don't think i shall venture\\nto look in her face till i see my father's again.\\n\\nhastings.  i'm surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so\\ncool a lover.\\n\\nmarlow.  to be explicit, my dear hastings, my chief inducement down was\\nto be instrumental in forwarding your happiness, not my own.  miss\\nneville loves you, the family don't know you; as my friend you are sure\\nof a reception, and let honour do the rest.\\n\\nhastings.  my dear marlow!  but i'll suppress the emotion.  were i a\\nwretch, meanly seeking to carry off a fortune, you should be the last\\nman in the world i would apply to for assistance.  but miss neville's\\nperson is all i ask, and that is mine, both from her deceased father's\\nconsent, and her own inclination.\\n\\nmarlow.  happy man!  you have talents and art to captivate any woman.\\ni'm doom'd to adore the sex, and yet to converse with the only part of\\nit i despise.  this stammer in my address, and this awkward\\nprepossessing visage of mine, can never permit me to soar above the\\nreach of a milliner's 'prentice, or one of the duchesses of drury-lane.\\npshaw! this fellow here to interrupt us.\\n\\n\\nenter hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  gentlemen, once more you are heartily welcome.  which is\\nmr. marlow?  sir, you are heartily welcome.  it's not my way, you see,\\nto receive my friends with my back to the fire.  i like give them a\\nhearty reception in the old style at my gate.  i like to see their\\nhorses and trunks taken care of.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  he has got our names from the servants already.  (to\\nhim.)  we approve your caution and hospitality, sir.  (to hastings.)  i\\nhave been thinking, george, of changing our travelling dresses in the\\nmorning.  i am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i beg, mr. marlow, you'll use no ceremony in this house.\\n\\nhastings.  i fancy, charles, you're right: the first blow is half the\\nbattle.  i intend opening the campaign with the white and gold.\\n\\nhardcastle.  mr. marlow--mr. hastings--gentlemen--pray be under no\\nconstraint in this house.  this is liberty-hall, gentlemen.  you may do\\njust as you please here.\\n\\nmarlow.  yet, george, if we open the campaign too fiercely at first, we\\nmay want ammunition before it is over.  i think to reserve the\\nembroidery to secure a retreat.\\n\\nhardcastle.  your talking of a retreat, mr. marlow, puts me in mind of\\nthe duke of marlborough, when we went to besiege denain.  he first\\nsummoned the garrison----\\n\\nmarlow.  don't you think the ventre d'or waistcoat will do with the\\nplain brown?\\n\\nhardcastle.  he first summoned the garrison, which might consist of\\nabout five thousand men----\\n\\nhastings.  i think not: brown and yellow mix but very poorly.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i say, gentlemen, as i was telling you, be summoned the\\ngarrison, which might consist of about five thousand men----\\n\\nmarlow.  the girls like finery.\\n\\nhardcastle.  which might consist of about five thousand men, well\\nappointed with stores, ammunition, and other implements of war.  now,\\nsays the duke of marlborough to george brooks, that stood next to\\nhim--you must have heard of george brooks--i'll pawn my dukedom, says\\nhe, but i take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood.  so----\\n\\nmarlow.  what, my good friend, if you gave us a glass of punch in the\\nmean time; it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour.\\n\\nhardcastle.  punch, sir!  (aside.)  this is the most unaccountable kind\\nof modesty i ever met with.\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, sir, punch.  a glass of warm punch, after our journey,\\nwill be comfortable.  this is liberty-hall, you know.\\n\\nhardcastle.  here's a cup, sir.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  so this fellow, in his liberty-hall, will only let\\nus have just what he pleases.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (taking the cup.)  i hope you'll find it to your mind.  i\\nhave prepared it with my own hands, and i believe you'll own the\\ningredients are tolerable.  will you be so good as to pledge me, sir?\\nhere, mr. marlow, here is to our better acquaintance.  [drinks.]\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  a very impudent fellow this! but he's a character,\\nand i'll humour him a little.  sir, my service to you.  [drinks.]\\n\\nhastings.  (aside.)  i see this fellow wants to give us his company,\\nand forgets that he's an innkeeper, before he has learned to be a\\ngentleman.\\n\\nmarlow.  from the excellence of your cup, my old friend, i suppose you\\nhave a good deal of business in this part of the country.  warm work,\\nnow and then, at elections, i suppose.\\n\\nhardcastle.  no, sir, i have long given that work over.  since our\\nbetters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other, there is no\\nbusiness \\\"for us that sell ale.\\\"\\n\\nhastings.  so, then, you have no turn for politics, i find.\\n\\nhardcastle.  not in the least.  there was a time, indeed, i fretted\\nmyself about the mistakes of government, like other people; but finding\\nmyself every day grow more angry, and the government growing no better,\\ni left it to mend itself.  since that, i no more trouble my head about\\nhyder ally, or ally cawn, than about ally croker.  sir, my service to\\nyou.\\n\\nhastings.  so that with eating above stairs, and drinking below, with\\nreceiving your friends within, and amusing them without, you lead a\\ngood pleasant bustling life of it.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i do stir about a great deal, that's certain.  half the\\ndifferences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour.\\n\\nmarlow.  (after drinking.)  and you have an argument in your cup, old\\ngentleman, better than any in westminster-hall.\\n\\nhardcastle.  ay, young gentleman, that, and a little philosophy.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  well, this is the first time i ever heard of an\\ninnkeeper's philosophy.\\n\\nhastings.  so then, like an experienced general, you attack them on\\nevery quarter.  if you find their reason manageable, you attack it with\\nyour philosophy; if you find they have no reason, you attack them with\\nthis.  here's your health, my philosopher.  [drinks.]\\n\\nhardcastle.  good, very good, thank you; ha! ha!  your generalship puts\\nme in mind of prince eugene, when he fought the turks at the battle of\\nbelgrade.  you shall hear.\\n\\nmarlow.  instead of the battle of belgrade, i believe it's almost time\\nto talk about supper.  what has your philosophy got in the house for\\nsupper?\\n\\nhardcastle.  for supper, sir!  (aside.)  was ever such a request to a\\nman in his own house?\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, sir, supper, sir; i begin to feel an appetite.  i shall\\nmake devilish work to-night in the larder, i promise you.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (aside.)  such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld.\\n(to him.)  why, really, sir, as for supper i can't well tell.  my\\ndorothy and the cook-maid settle these things between them.  i leave\\nthese kind of things entirely to them.\\n\\nmarlow.  you do, do you?\\n\\nhardcastle.  entirely.  by the bye, i believe they are in actual\\nconsultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen.\\n\\nmarlow.  then i beg they'll admit me as one of their privy council.\\nit's a way i have got.  when i travel, i always chose to regulate my\\nown supper.  let the cook be called.  no offence i hope, sir.\\n\\nhardcastle.  o no, sir, none in the least; yet i don't know how; our\\nbridget, the cook-maid, is not very communicative upon these\\noccasions.  should we send for her, she might scold us all out of the\\nhouse.\\n\\nhastings.  let's see your list of the larder then.  i ask it as a\\nfavour.  i always match my appetite to my bill of fare.\\n\\nmarlow.  (to hardcastle, who looks at them with surprise.)  sir, he's\\nvery right, and it's my way too.\\n\\nhardcastle.  sir, you have a right to command here.  here, roger,\\nbring us the bill of fare for to-night's supper: i believe it's drawn\\nout--your manner, mr. hastings, puts me in mind of my uncle, colonel\\nwallop.  it was a saying of his, that no man was sure of his supper\\ntill he had eaten it.\\n\\nhastings.  (aside.)  all upon the high rope!  his uncle a colonel! we\\nshall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace.  but let's\\nhear the bill of fare.\\n\\nmarlow.  (perusing.)  what's here?  for the first course; for the\\nsecond course; for the dessert.  the devil, sir, do you think we have\\nbrought down a whole joiners' company, or the corporation of bedford,\\nto eat up such a supper?  two or three little things, clean and\\ncomfortable, will do.\\n\\nhastings.  but let's hear it.\\n\\nmarlow.  (reading.)  for the first course, at the top, a pig and prune\\nsauce.\\n\\nhastings.  damn your pig, i say.\\n\\nmarlow.  and damn your prune sauce, say i.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and yet, gentlemen, to men that are hungry, pig with\\nprune sauce is very good eating.\\n\\nmarlow.  at the bottom, a calf's tongue and brains.\\n\\nhastings.  let your brains be knocked out, my good sir, i don't like\\nthem.\\n\\nmarlow.  or you may clap them on a plate by themselves.  i do.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (aside.)  their impudence confounds me.  (to them.)\\ngentlemen, you are my guests, make what alterations you please.  is\\nthere anything else you wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?\\n\\nmarlow.  item, a pork pie, a boiled rabbit and sausages, a florentine,\\na shaking pudding, and a dish of tiff--taff--taffety cream.\\n\\nhastings.  confound your made dishes; i shall be as much at a loss in\\nthis house as at a green and yellow dinner at the french ambassador's\\ntable.  i'm for plain eating.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i'm sorry, gentlemen, that i have nothing you like, but if\\nthere be anything you have a particular fancy to----\\n\\nmarlow.  why, really, sir, your bill of fare is so exquisite, that any\\none part of it is full as good as another.  send us what you please.\\nso much for supper.  and now to see that our beds are aired, and\\nproperly taken care of.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i entreat you'll leave that to me.  you shall not stir a\\nstep.\\n\\nmarlow.  leave that to you!  i protest, sir, you must excuse me, i\\nalways look to these things myself.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i must insist, sir, you'll make yourself easy on that\\nhead.\\n\\nmarlow.  you see i'm resolved on it.  (aside.)  a very troublesome\\nfellow this, as i ever met with.\\n\\nhardcastle.  well, sir, i'm resolved at least to attend you.  (aside.)\\nthis may be modern modesty, but i never saw anything look so like\\nold-fashioned impudence.  [exeunt marlow and hardcastle.]\\n\\nhastings.  (alone.)  so i find this fellow's civilities begin to grow\\ntroublesome.  but who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant\\nto please him?  ha! what do i see?  miss neville, by all that's happy!\\n\\n\\nenter miss neville.\\n\\n\\nmiss neville.  my dear hastings!  to what unexpected good fortune, to\\nwhat accident, am i to ascribe this happy meeting?\\n\\nhastings.  rather let me ask the same question, as i could never have\\nhoped to meet my dearest constance at an inn.\\n\\nmiss neville.  an inn! sure you mistake: my aunt, my guardian, lives\\nhere.  what could induce you to think this house an inn?\\n\\nhastings.  my friend, mr. marlow, with whom i came down, and i, have\\nbeen sent here as to an inn, i assure you.  a young fellow, whom we\\naccidentally met at a house hard by, directed us hither.\\n\\nmiss neville.  certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks,\\nof whom you have heard me talk so often; ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nhastings.  he whom your aunt intends for you? he of whom i have such\\njust apprehensions?\\n\\nmiss neville.  you have nothing to fear from him, i assure you.  you'd\\nadore him, if you knew how heartily he despises me.  my aunt knows it\\ntoo, and has undertaken to court me for him, and actually begins to\\nthink she has made a conquest.\\n\\nhastings.  thou dear dissembler!  you must know, my constance, i have\\njust seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get\\nadmittance into the family.  the horses that carried us down are now\\nfatigued with their journey, but they'll soon be refreshed; and then,\\nif my dearest girl will trust in her faithful hastings, we shall soon\\nbe landed in france, where even among slaves the laws of marriage are\\nrespected.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i have often told you, that though ready to obey you, i\\nyet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance.  the\\ngreatest part of it was left me by my uncle, the india director, and\\nchiefly consists in jewels.  i have been for some time persuading my\\naunt to let me wear them.  i fancy i'm very near succeeding.  the\\ninstant they are put into my possession, you shall find me ready to\\nmake them and myself yours.\\n\\nhastings.  perish the baubles!  your person is all i desire.  in the\\nmean time, my friend marlow must not be let into his mistake.  i know\\nthe strange reserve of his temper is such, that if abruptly informed of\\nit, he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for\\nexecution.\\n\\nmiss neville.  but how shall we keep him in the deception?  miss\\nhardcastle is just returned from walking; what if we still continue to\\ndeceive him?----this, this way----[they confer.]\\n\\n\\nenter marlow.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  the assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond bearing.\\nmy host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone, and so he\\nclaps not only himself, but his old-fashioned wife, on my back.  they\\ntalk of coming to sup with us too; and then, i suppose, we are to run\\nthe gantlet through all the rest of the family.--what have we got here?\\n\\nhastings.  my dear charles!  let me congratulate you!--the most\\nfortunate accident!--who do you think is just alighted?\\n\\nmarlow.  cannot guess.\\n\\nhastings.  our mistresses, boy, miss hardcastle and miss neville.\\ngive me leave to introduce miss constance neville to your\\nacquaintance.  happening to dine in the neighbourhood, they called on\\ntheir return to take fresh horses here.  miss hardcastle has just stept\\ninto the next room, and will be back in an instant.  wasn't it lucky?\\neh!\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  i have been mortified enough of all conscience, and\\nhere comes something to complete my embarrassment.\\n\\nhastings.  well, but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world?\\n\\nmarlow.  oh! yes.  very fortunate--a most joyful encounter--but our\\ndresses, george, you know are in disorder--what if we should postpone\\nthe happiness till to-morrow?--to-morrow at her own house--it will be\\nevery bit as convenient--and rather more respectful--to-morrow let it\\nbe.  [offering to go.]\\n\\nmiss neville.  by no means, sir.  your ceremony will displease her.\\nthe disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience.\\nbesides, she knows you are in the house, and will permit you to see\\nher.\\n\\nmarlow.  o! the devil! how shall i support it?  hem! hem!  hastings,\\nyou must not go.  you are to assist me, you know.  i shall be\\nconfoundedly ridiculous.  yet, hang it!  i'll take courage.  hem!\\n\\nhastings.  pshaw, man! it's but the first plunge, and all's over.\\nshe's but a woman, you know.\\n\\nmarlow.  and, of all women, she that i dread most to encounter.\\n\\n\\nenter miss hardcastle, as returned from walking, a bonnet, etc.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  (introducing them.)  miss hardcastle, mr. marlow.  i'm\\nproud of bringing two persons of such merit together, that only want to\\nknow, to esteem each other.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (aside.)  now for meeting my modest gentleman with a\\ndemure face, and quite in his own manner.  (after a pause, in which he\\nappears very uneasy and disconcerted.)  i'm glad of your safe arrival,\\nsir.  i'm told you had some accidents by the way.\\n\\nmarlow.  only a few, madam.  yes, we had some.  yes, madam, a good many\\naccidents, but should be sorry--madam--or rather glad of any\\naccidents--that are so agreeably concluded.  hem!\\n\\nhastings.  (to him.)  you never spoke better in your whole life.  keep\\nit up, and i'll insure you the victory.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i'm afraid you flatter, sir.  you that have seen so\\nmuch of the finest company, can find little entertainment in an obscure\\ncorner of the country.\\n\\nmarlow.  (gathering courage.)  i have lived, indeed, in the world,\\nmadam; but i have kept very little company.  i have been but an\\nobserver upon life, madam, while others were enjoying it.\\n\\nmiss neville.  but that, i am told, is the way to enjoy it at last.\\n\\nhastings.  (to him.)  cicero never spoke better.  once more, and you\\nare confirmed in assurance for ever.\\n\\nmarlow.  (to him.)  hem!  stand by me, then, and when i'm down, throw\\nin a word or two, to set me up again.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  an observer, like you, upon life were, i fear,\\ndisagreeably employed, since you must have had much more to censure\\nthan to approve.\\n\\nmarlow.  pardon me, madam.  i was always willing to be amused.  the\\nfolly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness.\\n\\nhastings.  (to him.)  bravo, bravo.  never spoke so well in your whole\\nlife.  well, miss hardcastle, i see that you and mr. marlow are going\\nto be very good company.  i believe our being here will but embarrass\\nthe interview.\\n\\nmarlow.  not in the least, mr. hastings.  we like your company of all\\nthings.  (to him.)  zounds!  george, sure you won't go? how can you\\nleave us?\\n\\nhastings.  our presence will but spoil conversation, so we'll retire to\\nthe next room.  (to him.)  you don't consider, man, that we are to\\nmanage a little tete-a-tete of our own.  [exeunt.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (after a pause).  but you have not been wholly an\\nobserver, i presume, sir: the ladies, i should hope, have employed some\\npart of your addresses.\\n\\nmarlow.  (relapsing into timidity.)  pardon me, madam, i--i--i--as yet\\nhave studied--only--to--deserve them.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and that, some say, is the very worst way to obtain\\nthem.\\n\\nmarlow.  perhaps so, madam.  but i love to converse only with the more\\ngrave and sensible part of the sex.  but i'm afraid i grow tiresome.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  not at all, sir; there is nothing i like so much as\\ngrave conversation myself; i could hear it for ever.  indeed, i have\\noften been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those\\nlight airy pleasures, where nothing reaches the heart.\\n\\nmarlow.  it's----a disease----of the mind, madam.  in the variety of\\ntastes there must be some who, wanting a relish----for----um--a--um.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i understand you, sir.  there must be some, who,\\nwanting a relish for refined pleasures, pretend to despise what they\\nare incapable of tasting.\\n\\nmarlow.  my meaning, madam, but infinitely better expressed.  and i\\ncan't help observing----a----\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (aside.)  who could ever suppose this fellow\\nimpudent upon some occasions?  (to him.)  you were going to observe,\\nsir----\\n\\nmarlow.  i was observing, madam--i protest, madam, i forget what i was\\ngoing to observe.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (aside.)  i vow and so do i.  (to him.)  you were\\nobserving, sir, that in this age of hypocrisy--something about\\nhypocrisy, sir.\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, madam.  in this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon\\nstrict inquiry do not--a--a--a--\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i understand you perfectly, sir.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  egad! and that's more than i do myself.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  you mean that in this hypocritical age there are few\\nthat do not condemn in public what they practise in private, and think\\nthey pay every debt to virtue when they praise it.\\n\\nmarlow.  true, madam; those who have most virtue in their mouths, have\\nleast of it in their bosoms.  but i'm sure i tire you, madam.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  not in the least, sir; there's something so\\nagreeable and spirited in your manner, such life and force--pray, sir,\\ngo on.\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, madam.  i was saying----that there are some occasions,\\nwhen a total want of courage, madam, destroys all the----and puts\\nus----upon a--a--a--\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i agree with you entirely; a want of courage upon\\nsome occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance, and betrays us when\\nwe most want to excel.  i beg you'll proceed.\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, madam.  morally speaking, madam--but i see miss neville\\nexpecting us in the next room.  i would not intrude for the world.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i protest, sir, i never was more agreeably\\nentertained in all my life.  pray go on.\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, madam, i was----but she beckons us to join her.  madam,\\nshall i do myself the honour to attend you?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  well, then, i'll follow.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  this pretty smooth dialogue has done for me.\\n[exit.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (alone.)  ha! ha! ha!  was there ever such a sober,\\nsentimental interview?  i'm certain he scarce looked in my face the\\nwhole time.  yet the fellow, but for his unaccountable bashfulness, is\\npretty well too.  he has good sense, but then so buried in his fears,\\nthat it fatigues one more than ignorance.  if i could teach him a\\nlittle confidence, it would be doing somebody that i know of a piece of\\nservice.  but who is that somebody?--that, faith, is a question i can\\nscarce answer.  [exit.]\\n\\n\\nenter tony and miss neville, followed by mrs. hardcastle and hastings.\\n\\n\\ntony.  what do you follow me for, cousin con?  i wonder you're not\\nashamed to be so very engaging.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i hope, cousin, one may speak to one's own relations,\\nand not be to blame.\\n\\ntony.  ay, but i know what sort of a relation you want to make me,\\nthough; but it won't do.  i tell you, cousin con, it won't do; so i beg\\nyou'll keep your distance, i want no nearer relationship.  [she\\nfollows, coquetting him to the back scene.]\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  well!  i vow, mr. hastings, you are very\\nentertaining.  there's nothing in the world i love to talk of so much\\nas london, and the fashions, though i was never there myself.\\n\\nhastings.  never there!  you amaze me!  from your air and manner, i\\nconcluded you had been bred all your life either at ranelagh, st.\\njames's, or tower wharf.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  o! sir, you're only pleased to say so.  we country\\npersons can have no manner at all.  i'm in love with the town, and that\\nserves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics; but who can\\nhave a manner, that has never seen the pantheon, the grotto gardens,\\nthe borough, and such places where the nobility chiefly resort?  all i\\ncan do is to enjoy london at second-hand.  i take care to know every\\ntete-a-tete from the scandalous magazine, and have all the fashions, as\\nthey come out, in a letter from the two miss rickets of crooked lane.\\npray how do you like this head, mr. hastings?\\n\\nhastings.  extremely elegant and degagee, upon my word, madam.  your\\nfriseur is a frenchman, i suppose?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  i protest, i dressed it myself from a print in the\\nladies' memorandum-book for the last year.\\n\\nhastings.  indeed!  such a head in a side-box at the play-house would\\ndraw as many gazers as my lady mayoress at a city ball.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  i vow, since inoculation began, there is no such\\nthing to be seen as a plain woman; so one must dress a little\\nparticular, or one may escape in the crowd.\\n\\nhastings.  but that can never be your case, madam, in any dress.\\n(bowing.)\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  yet, what signifies my dressing when i have such a\\npiece of antiquity by my side as mr. hardcastle: all i can say will\\nnever argue down a single button from his clothes.  i have often wanted\\nhim to throw off his great flaxen wig, and where he was bald, to\\nplaster it over, like my lord pately, with powder.\\n\\nhastings.  you are right, madam; for, as among the ladies there are\\nnone ugly, so among the men there are none old.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  but what do you think his answer was?  why, with his\\nusual gothic vivacity, he said i only wanted him to throw off his wig,\\nto convert it into a tete for my own wearing.\\n\\nhastings.  intolerable!  at your age you may wear what you please, and\\nit must become you.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  pray, mr. hastings, what do you take to be the most\\nfashionable age about town?\\n\\nhastings.  some time ago, forty was all the mode; but i'm told the\\nladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  seriously.  then i shall be too young for the\\nfashion.\\n\\nhastings.  no lady begins now to put on jewels till she's past forty.\\nfor instance, miss there, in a polite circle, would be considered as a\\nchild, as a mere maker of samplers.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  and yet mrs. niece thinks herself as much a woman,\\nand is as fond of jewels, as the oldest of us all.\\n\\nhastings.  your niece, is she?  and that young gentleman, a brother of\\nyours, i should presume?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  my son, sir.  they are contracted to each other.\\nobserve their little sports.  they fall in and out ten times a day, as\\nif they were man and wife already.  (to them.)  well, tony, child, what\\nsoft things are you saying to your cousin constance this evening?\\n\\ntony.  i have been saying no soft things; but that it's very hard to be\\nfollowed about so.  ecod! i've not a place in the house now that's left\\nto myself, but the stable.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  never mind him, con, my dear.  he's in another story\\nbehind your back.\\n\\nmiss neville.  there's something generous in my cousin's manner.  he\\nfalls out before faces to be forgiven in private.\\n\\ntony.  that's a damned confounded--crack.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  ah! he's a sly one.  don't you think they are like\\neach other about the mouth, mr. hastings?  the blenkinsop mouth to a t.\\nthey're of a size too.  back to back, my pretties, that mr. hastings\\nmay see you.  come, tony.\\n\\ntony.  you had as good not make me, i tell you.  (measuring.)\\n\\nmiss neville.  o lud! he has almost cracked my head.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  o, the monster!  for shame, tony.  you a man, and\\nbehave so!\\n\\ntony.  if i'm a man, let me have my fortin.  ecod! i'll not be made a\\nfool of no longer.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  is this, ungrateful boy, all that i'm to get for the\\npains i have taken in your education?  i that have rocked you in your\\ncradle, and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon!  did not i work that\\nwaistcoat to make you genteel?  did not i prescribe for you every day,\\nand weep while the receipt was operating?\\n\\ntony.  ecod! you had reason to weep, for you have been dosing me ever\\nsince i was born.  i have gone through every receipt in the complete\\nhuswife ten times over; and you have thoughts of coursing me through\\nquincy next spring.  but, ecod! i tell you, i'll not be made a fool of\\nno longer.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  wasn't it all for your good, viper?  wasn't it all\\nfor your good?\\n\\ntony.  i wish you'd let me and my good alone, then.  snubbing this way\\nwhen i'm in spirits.  if i'm to have any good, let it come of itself;\\nnot to keep dinging it, dinging it into one so.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  that's false; i never see you when you're in\\nspirits.  no, tony, you then go to the alehouse or kennel.  i'm never\\nto be delighted with your agreeable wild notes, unfeeling monster!\\n\\ntony.  ecod! mamma, your own notes are the wildest of the two.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  was ever the like?  but i see he wants to break my\\nheart, i see he does.\\n\\nhastings.  dear madam, permit me to lecture the young gentleman a\\nlittle.  i'm certain i can persuade him to his duty.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  well, i must retire.  come, constance, my love.  you\\nsee, mr. hastings, the wretchedness of my situation: was ever poor\\nwoman so plagued with a dear sweet, pretty, provoking, undutiful boy?\\n[exeunt mrs. hardcastle and miss neville.]\\n\\ntony.  (singing.)  \\\"there was a young man riding by, and fain would\\nhave his will.  rang do didlo dee.\\\"----don't mind her.  let her cry.\\nit's the comfort of her heart.  i have seen her and sister cry over a\\nbook for an hour together; and they said they liked the book the better\\nthe more it made them cry.\\n\\nhastings.  then you're no friend to the ladies, i find, my pretty\\nyoung gentleman?\\n\\ntony.  that's as i find 'um.\\n\\nhastings.  not to her of your mother's choosing, i dare answer?  and\\nyet she appears to me a pretty well-tempered girl.\\n\\ntony.  that's because you don't know her as well as i.  ecod! i know\\nevery inch about her; and there's not a more bitter cantankerous toad\\nin all christendom.\\n\\nhastings.  (aside.)  pretty encouragement this for a lover!\\n\\ntony.  i have seen her since the height of that.  she has as many\\ntricks as a hare in a thicket, or a colt the first day's breaking.\\n\\nhastings.  to me she appears sensible and silent.\\n\\ntony.  ay, before company.  but when she's with her playmate, she's as\\nloud as a hog in a gate.\\n\\nhastings.  but there is a meek modesty about her that charms me.\\n\\ntony.  yes, but curb her never so little, she kicks up, and you're\\nflung in a ditch.\\n\\nhastings.  well, but you must allow her a little beauty.--yes, you must\\nallow her some beauty.\\n\\ntony.  bandbox!  she's all a made-up thing, mun.  ah! could you but see\\nbet bouncer of these parts, you might then talk of beauty.  ecod, she\\nhas two eyes as black as sloes, and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit\\ncushion.  she'd make two of she.\\n\\nhastings.  well, what say you to a friend that would take this bitter\\nbargain off your hands?\\n\\ntony.  anon.\\n\\nhastings.  would you thank him that would take miss neville, and leave\\nyou to happiness and your dear betsy?\\n\\ntony.  ay; but where is there such a friend, for who would take her?\\n\\nhastings.  i am he.  if you but assist me, i'll engage to whip her off\\nto france, and you shall never hear more of her.\\n\\ntony.  assist you!  ecod i will, to the last drop of my blood.  i'll\\nclap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a\\ntwinkling, and may he get you a part of her fortin beside, in jewels,\\nthat you little dream of.\\n\\nhastings.  my dear 'squire, this looks like a lad of spirit.\\n\\ntony.  come along, then, and you shall see more of my spirit before you\\nhave done with me.\\n\\n(singing.)\\n\\\"we are the boys\\nthat fears no noise\\nwhere the thundering cannons roar.\\\"  [exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenter hardcastle, alone.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  what could my old friend sir charles mean by recommending\\nhis son as the modestest young man in town?  to me he appears the most\\nimpudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue.  he has taken\\npossession of the easy chair by the fire-side already.  he took off his\\nboots in the parlour, and desired me to see them taken care of.  i'm\\ndesirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter.  she will\\ncertainly be shocked at it.\\n\\n\\nenter miss hardcastle, plainly dressed.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  well, my kate, i see you have changed your dress, as i\\nbade you; and yet, i believe, there was no great occasion.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i find such a pleasure, sir, in obeying your\\ncommands, that i take care to observe them without ever debating their\\npropriety.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and yet, kate, i sometimes give you some cause,\\nparticularly when i recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover\\nto-day.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  you taught me to expect something extraordinary, and\\ni find the original exceeds the description.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i was never so surprised in my life!  he has quite\\nconfounded all my faculties!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i never saw anything like it: and a man of the world\\ntoo!\\n\\nhardcastle.  ay, he learned it all abroad--what a fool was i, to think\\na young man could learn modesty by travelling.  he might as soon learn\\nwit at a masquerade.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  it seems all natural to him.\\n\\nhardcastle.  a good deal assisted by bad company and a french\\ndancing-master.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  sure you mistake, papa!  a french dancing-master\\ncould never have taught him that timid look--that awkward address--that\\nbashful manner--\\n\\nhardcastle.  whose look?  whose manner, child?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  mr. marlow's: his mauvaise honte, his timidity,\\nstruck me at the first sight.\\n\\nhardcastle.  then your first sight deceived you; for i think him one of\\nthe most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  sure, sir, you rally!  i never saw any one so\\nmodest.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and can you be serious?  i never saw such a bouncing,\\nswaggering puppy since i was born.  bully dawson was but a fool to him.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  surprising!  he met me with a respectful bow, a\\nstammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.\\n\\nhardcastle.  he met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a\\nfamiliarity that made my blood freeze again.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  he treated me with diffidence and respect; censured\\nthe manners of the age; admired the prudence of girls that never\\nlaughed; tired me with apologies for being tiresome; then left the room\\nwith a bow, and \\\"madam, i would not for the world detain you.\\\"\\n\\nhardcastle.  he spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before;\\nasked twenty questions, and never waited for an answer; interrupted my\\nbest remarks with some silly pun; and when i was in my best story of\\nthe duke of marlborough and prince eugene, he asked if i had not a good\\nhand at making punch.  yes, kate, he asked your father if he was a\\nmaker of punch!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  one of us must certainly be mistaken.\\n\\nhardcastle.  if he be what he has shown himself, i'm determined he\\nshall never have my consent.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and if he be the sullen thing i take him, he shall\\nnever have mine.\\n\\nhardcastle.  in one thing then we are agreed--to reject him.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  yes: but upon conditions.  for if you should find him\\nless impudent, and i more presuming--if you find him more respectful,\\nand i more importunate--i don't know--the fellow is well enough for a\\nman--certainly, we don't meet many such at a horse-race in the country.\\n\\nhardcastle.  if we should find him so----but that's impossible.  the\\nfirst appearance has done my business.  i'm seldom deceived in that.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and yet there may be many good qualities under that\\nfirst appearance.\\n\\nhardcastle.  ay, when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste, she\\nthen sets about guessing the rest of his furniture.  with her, a smooth\\nface stands for good sense, and a genteel figure for every virtue.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i hope, sir, a conversation begun with a compliment\\nto my good sense, won't end with a sneer at my understanding?\\n\\nhardcastle.  pardon me, kate.  but if young mr. brazen can find the art\\nof reconciling contradictions, he may please us both, perhaps.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and as one of us must be mistaken, what if we go to\\nmake further discoveries?\\n\\nhardcastle.  agreed.  but depend on't i'm in the right.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and depend on't i'm not much in the wrong.\\n[exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nenter tony, running in with a casket.\\n\\n\\ntony.  ecod! i have got them.  here they are.  my cousin con's\\nnecklaces, bobs and all.  my mother shan't cheat the poor souls out of\\ntheir fortin neither.  o! my genus, is that you?\\n\\n\\nenter hastings.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  my dear friend, how have you managed with your mother?  i\\nhope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin, and that\\nyou are willing to be reconciled at last?  our horses will be refreshed\\nin a short time, and we shall soon be ready to set off.\\n\\ntony.  and here's something to bear your charges by the way (giving the\\ncasket); your sweetheart's jewels.  keep them: and hang those, i say,\\nthat would rob you of one of them.\\n\\nhastings.  but how have you procured them from your mother?\\n\\ntony.  ask me no questions, and i'll tell you no fibs.  i procured them\\nby the rule of thumb.  if i had not a key to every drawer in mother's\\nbureau, how could i go to the alehouse so often as i do?  an honest man\\nmay rob himself of his own at any time.\\n\\nhastings.  thousands do it every day.  but to be plain with you; miss\\nneville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very\\ninstant.  if she succeeds, it will be the most delicate way at least of\\nobtaining them.\\n\\ntony.  well, keep them, till you know how it will be.  but i know how\\nit will be well enough; she'd as soon part with the only sound tooth in\\nher head.\\n\\nhastings.  but i dread the effects of her resentment, when she finds\\nshe has lost them.\\n\\ntony.  never you mind her resentment, leave me to manage that.  i\\ndon't value her resentment the bounce of a cracker.  zounds! here they\\nare.  morrice! prance!  [exit hastings.]\\n\\n\\nenter mrs. hardcastle and miss neville.\\n\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  indeed, constance, you amaze me.  such a girl as you\\nwant jewels!  it will be time enough for jewels, my dear, twenty years\\nhence, when your beauty begins to want repairs.\\n\\nmiss neville.  but what will repair beauty at forty, will certainly\\nimprove it at twenty, madam.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  yours, my dear, can admit of none.  that natural\\nblush is beyond a thousand ornaments.  besides, child, jewels are quite\\nout at present.  don't you see half the ladies of our acquaintance, my\\nlady kill-daylight, and mrs. crump, and the rest of them, carry their\\njewels to town, and bring nothing but paste and marcasites back.\\n\\nmiss neville.  but who knows, madam, but somebody that shall be\\nnameless would like me best with all my little finery about me?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  consult your glass, my dear, and then see if, with\\nsuch a pair of eyes, you want any better sparklers.  what do you think,\\ntony, my dear? does your cousin con. want any jewels in your eyes to\\nset off her beauty?\\n\\ntony.  that's as thereafter may be.\\n\\nmiss neville.  my dear aunt, if you knew how it would oblige me.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  a parcel of old-fashioned rose and table-cut things.\\nthey would make you look like the court of king solomon at a\\npuppet-show.  besides, i believe, i can't readily come at them.  they\\nmay be missing, for aught i know to the contrary.\\n\\ntony.  (apart to mrs. hardcastle.)  then why don't you tell her so at\\nonce, as she's so longing for them?  tell her they're lost.  it's the\\nonly way to quiet her.  say they're lost, and call me to bear witness.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (apart to tony.)  you know, my dear, i'm only\\nkeeping them for you.  so if i say they're gone, you'll bear me\\nwitness, will you?  he! he! he!\\n\\ntony.  never fear me.  ecod! i'll say i saw them taken out with my own\\neyes.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i desire them but for a day, madam.  just to be\\npermitted to show them as relics, and then they may be locked up\\nagain.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  to be plain with you, my dear constance, if i could\\nfind them you should have them.  they're missing, i assure you.  lost,\\nfor aught i know; but we must have patience wherever they are.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i'll not believe it! this is but a shallow pretence to\\ndeny me.  i know they are too valuable to be so slightly kept, and as\\nyou are to answer for the loss--\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  don't be alarmed, constance.  if they be lost, i must\\nrestore an equivalent.  but my son knows they are missing, and not to\\nbe found.\\n\\ntony.  that i can bear witness to.  they are missing, and not to be\\nfound; i'll take my oath on't.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  you must learn resignation, my dear; for though we\\nlose our fortune, yet we should not lose our patience.  see me, how\\ncalm i am.\\n\\nmiss neville.  ay, people are generally calm at the misfortunes of\\nothers.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  now i wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a\\nthought upon such trumpery.  we shall soon find them; and in the mean\\ntime you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i detest garnets.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  the most becoming things in the world to set off a\\nclear complexion.  you have often seen how well they look upon me.  you\\nshall have them.  [exit.]\\n\\nmiss neville.  i dislike them of all things.  you shan't stir.--was\\never anything so provoking, to mislay my own jewels, and force me to\\nwear her trumpery?\\n\\ntony.  don't be a fool.  if she gives you the garnets, take what you\\ncan get.  the jewels are your own already.  i have stolen them out of\\nher bureau, and she does not know it.  fly to your spark, he'll tell\\nyou more of the matter.  leave me to manage her.\\n\\nmiss neville.  my dear cousin!\\n\\ntony.  vanish.  she's here, and has missed them already.  [exit miss\\nneville.] zounds! how she fidgets and spits about like a catherine\\nwheel.\\n\\n\\nenter mrs. hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  confusion! thieves! robbers! we are cheated,\\nplundered, broke open, undone.\\n\\ntony.  what's the matter, what's the matter, mamma?  i hope nothing has\\nhappened to any of the good family!\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  we are robbed.  my bureau has been broken open, the\\njewels taken out, and i'm undone.\\n\\ntony.  oh! is that all?  ha! ha! ha!  by the laws, i never saw it\\nacted better in my life.  ecod, i thought you was ruined in earnest,\\nha! ha! ha!\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  why, boy, i am ruined in earnest.  my bureau has been\\nbroken open, and all taken away.\\n\\ntony.  stick to that: ha! ha! ha! stick to that.  i'll bear witness,\\nyou know; call me to bear witness.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  i tell you, tony, by all that's precious, the jewels\\nare gone, and i shall be ruined for ever.\\n\\ntony.  sure i know they're gone, and i'm to say so.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  my dearest tony, but hear me.  they're gone, i say.\\n\\ntony.  by the laws, mamma, you make me for to laugh, ha! ha!  i know\\nwho took them well enough, ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  was there ever such a blockhead, that can't tell the\\ndifference between jest and earnest?  i tell you i'm not in jest,\\nbooby.\\n\\ntony.  that's right, that's right; you must be in a bitter passion, and\\nthen nobody will suspect either of us.  i'll bear witness that they are\\ngone.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  was there ever such a cross-grained brute, that\\nwon't hear me?  can you bear witness that you're no better than a\\nfool?  was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand, and\\nthieves on the other?\\n\\ntony.  i can bear witness to that.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  bear witness again, you blockhead you, and i'll turn\\nyou out of the room directly.  my poor niece, what will become of her?\\ndo you laugh, you unfeeling brute, as if you enjoyed my distress?\\n\\ntony.  i can bear witness to that.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  do you insult me, monster?  i'll teach you to vex\\nyour mother, i will.\\n\\ntony.  i can bear witness to that.  [he runs off, she follows him.]\\n\\n\\nenter miss hardcastle and maid.\\n\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  what an unaccountable creature is that brother of\\nmine, to send them to the house as an inn! ha! ha!  i don't wonder at\\nhis impudence.\\n\\nmaid.  but what is more, madam, the young gentleman, as you passed by\\nin your present dress, asked me if you were the bar-maid.  he mistook\\nyou for the bar-maid, madam.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  did he?  then as i live, i'm resolved to keep up the\\ndelusion.  tell me, pimple, how do you like my present dress?  don't\\nyou think i look something like cherry in the beaux stratagem?\\n\\nmaid.  it's the dress, madam, that every lady wears in the country, but\\nwhen she visits or receives company.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and are you sure he does not remember my face or\\nperson?\\n\\nmaid.  certain of it.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i vow, i thought so; for, though we spoke for some\\ntime together, yet his fears were such, that he never once looked up\\nduring the interview.  indeed, if he had, my bonnet would have kept him\\nfrom seeing me.\\n\\nmaid.  but what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  in the first place i shall be seen, and that is no\\nsmall advantage to a girl who brings her face to market.  then i shall\\nperhaps make an acquaintance, and that's no small victory gained over\\none who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex.  but my chief\\naim is, to take my gentleman off his guard, and, like an invisible\\nchampion of romance, examine the giant's force before i offer to\\ncombat.\\n\\nmaid.  but you are sure you can act your part, and disguise your voice\\nso that he may mistake that, as he has already mistaken your person?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  never fear me.  i think i have got the true bar\\ncant--did your honour call?--attend the lion there--pipes and tobacco\\nfor the angel.--the lamb has been outrageous this half-hour.\\n\\nmaid.  it will do, madam.  but he's here.  [exit maid.]\\n\\n\\nenter marlow.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  what a bawling in every part of the house!  i have scarce a\\nmoment's repose.  if i go to the best room, there i find my host and\\nhis story: if i fly to the gallery, there we have my hostess with her\\ncurtsey down to the ground.  i have at last got a moment to myself, and\\nnow for recollection.  [walks and muses.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  did you call, sir?  did your honour call?\\n\\nmarlow.  (musing.)  as for miss hardcastle, she's too grave and\\nsentimental for me.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  did your honour call?  (she still places herself\\nbefore him, he turning away.)\\n\\nmarlow.  no, child.  (musing.)  besides, from the glimpse i had of her,\\ni think she squints.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i'm sure, sir, i heard the bell ring.\\n\\nmarlow.  no, no.  (musing.)  i have pleased my father, however, by\\ncoming down, and i'll to-morrow please myself by returning.  [taking\\nout his tablets, and perusing.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  perhaps the other gentleman called, sir?\\n\\nmarlow.  i tell you, no.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i should be glad to know, sir.  we have such a\\nparcel of servants!\\n\\nmarlow.  no, no, i tell you.  (looks full in her face.)  yes, child, i\\nthink i did call.  i wanted--i wanted--i vow, child, you are vastly\\nhandsome.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  o la, sir, you'll make one ashamed.\\n\\nmarlow.  never saw a more sprightly malicious eye.  yes, yes, my dear,\\ni did call.  have you got any of your--a--what d'ye call it in the\\nhouse?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  no, sir, we have been out of that these ten days.\\n\\nmarlow.  one may call in this house, i find, to very little purpose.\\nsuppose i should call for a taste, just by way of a trial, of the\\nnectar of your lips; perhaps i might be disappointed in that too.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  nectar! nectar!  that's a liquor there's no call for\\nin these parts.  french, i suppose.  we sell no french wines here, sir.\\n\\nmarlow.  of true english growth, i assure you.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  then it's odd i should not know it.  we brew all\\nsorts of wines in this house, and i have lived here these eighteen\\nyears.\\n\\nmarlow.  eighteen years!  why, one would think, child, you kept the bar\\nbefore you were born.  how old are you?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  o! sir, i must not tell my age.  they say women and\\nmusic should never be dated.\\n\\nmarlow.  to guess at this distance, you can't be much above forty\\n(approaching).  yet, nearer, i don't think so much (approaching).  by\\ncoming close to some women they look younger still; but when we come\\nvery close indeed--(attempting to kiss her).\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  pray, sir, keep your distance.  one would think you\\nwanted to know one's age, as they do horses, by mark of mouth.\\n\\nmarlow.  i protest, child, you use me extremely ill.  if you keep me at\\nthis distance, how is it possible you and i can ever be acquainted?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and who wants to be acquainted with you?  i want no\\nsuch acquaintance, not i.  i'm sure you did not treat miss hardcastle,\\nthat was here awhile ago, in this obstropalous manner.  i'll warrant\\nme, before her you looked dashed, and kept bowing to the ground, and\\ntalked, for all the world, as if you was before a justice of peace.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  egad, she has hit it, sure enough!  (to her.)  in\\nawe of her, child?  ha! ha! ha!  a mere awkward squinting thing; no,\\nno.  i find you don't know me.  i laughed and rallied her a little; but\\ni was unwilling to be too severe.  no, i could not be too severe, curse\\nme!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  o! then, sir, you are a favourite, i find, among the\\nladies?\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, my dear, a great favourite.  and yet hang me, i don't see\\nwhat they find in me to follow.  at the ladies' club in town i'm called\\ntheir agreeable rattle.  rattle, child, is not my real name, but one\\ni'm known by.  my name is solomons; mr. solomons, my dear, at your\\nservice.  (offering to salute her.)\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  hold, sir; you are introducing me to your club, not\\nto yourself.  and you're so great a favourite there, you say?\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, my dear.  there's mrs. mantrap, lady betty blackleg, the\\ncountess of sligo, mrs. langhorns, old miss biddy buckskin, and your\\nhumble servant, keep up the spirit of the place.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  then it's a very merry place, i suppose?\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, as merry as cards, supper, wine, and old women can make\\nus.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and their agreeable rattle, ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  egad! i don't quite like this chit.  she looks\\nknowing, methinks.  you laugh, child?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i can't but laugh, to think what time they all have\\nfor minding their work or their family.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  all's well; she don't laugh at me.  (to her.)  do\\nyou ever work, child?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  ay, sure.  there's not a screen or quilt in the\\nwhole house but what can bear witness to that.\\n\\nmarlow.  odso! then you must show me your embroidery.  i embroider and\\ndraw patterns myself a little.  if you want a judge of your work, you\\nmust apply to me.  (seizing her hand.)\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  ay, but the colours do not look well by candlelight.\\nyou shall see all in the morning.  (struggling.)\\n\\nmarlow.  and why not now, my angel?  such beauty fires beyond the\\npower of resistance.--pshaw! the father here!  my old luck: i never\\nnicked seven that i did not throw ames ace three times following.\\n[exit marlow.]\\n\\n\\nenter hardcastle, who stands in surprise.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  so, madam.  so, i find this is your modest lover.  this is\\nyour humble admirer, that kept his eyes fixed on the ground, and only\\nadored at humble distance.  kate, kate, art thou not ashamed to deceive\\nyour father so?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  never trust me, dear papa, but he's still the modest\\nman i first took him for; you'll be convinced of it as well as i.\\n\\nhardcastle.  by the hand of my body, i believe his impudence is\\ninfectious!  didn't i see him seize your hand?  didn't i see him haul\\nyou about like a milkmaid?  and now you talk of his respect and his\\nmodesty, forsooth!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  but if i shortly convince you of his modesty, that he\\nhas only the faults that will pass off with time, and the virtues that\\nwill improve with age, i hope you'll forgive him.\\n\\nhardcastle.  the girl would actually make one run mad!  i tell you,\\ni'll not be convinced.  i am convinced.  he has scarce been three hours\\nin the house, and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives.\\nyou may like his impudence, and call it modesty; but my son-in-law,\\nmadam, must have very different qualifications.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  sir, i ask but this night to convince you.\\n\\nhardcastle.  you shall not have half the time, for i have thoughts of\\nturning him out this very hour.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  give me that hour then, and i hope to satisfy you.\\n\\nhardcastle.  well, an hour let it be then.  but i'll have no trifling\\nwith your father.  all fair and open, do you mind me.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i hope, sir, you have ever found that i considered\\nyour commands as my pride; for your kindness is such, that my duty as\\nyet has been inclination.  [exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenter hastings and miss neville.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  you surprise me; sir charles marlow expected here this\\nnight!  where have you had your information?\\n\\nmiss neville.  you may depend upon it.  i just saw his letter to mr.\\nhardcastle, in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours\\nafter his son.\\n\\nhastings.  then, my constance, all must be completed before he\\narrives.  he knows me; and should he find me here, would discover my\\nname, and perhaps my designs, to the rest of the family.\\n\\nmiss neville.  the jewels, i hope, are safe?\\n\\nhastings.  yes, yes, i have sent them to marlow, who keeps the keys of\\nour baggage.  in the mean time, i'll go to prepare matters for our\\nelopement.  i have had the 'squire's promise of a fresh pair of horses;\\nand if i should not see him again, will write him further directions.\\n[exit.]\\n\\nmiss neville.  well! success attend you.  in the mean time i'll go and\\namuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin.\\n[exit.]\\n\\n\\nenter marlow, followed by a servant.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  i wonder what hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a\\nthing as a casket to keep for him, when he knows the only place i have\\nis the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door.  have you deposited the\\ncasket with the landlady, as i ordered you?  have you put it into her\\nown hands?\\n\\nservant.  yes, your honour.\\n\\nmarlow.  she said she'd keep it safe, did she?\\n\\nservant.  yes, she said she'd keep it safe enough; she asked me how i\\ncame by it; and she said she had a great mind to make me give an\\naccount of myself.  [exit servant.]\\n\\nmarlow.  ha! ha! ha!  they're safe, however.  what an unaccountable set\\nof beings have we got amongst!  this little bar-maid though runs in my\\nhead most strangely, and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of\\nthe family.  she's mine, she must be mine, or i'm greatly mistaken.\\n\\n\\nenter hastings.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  bless me!  i quite forgot to tell her that i intended to\\nprepare at the bottom of the garden.  marlow here, and in spirits too!\\n\\nmarlow.  give me joy, george!  crown me, shadow me with laurels!\\nwell, george, after all, we modest fellows don't want for success\\namong the women.\\n\\nhastings.  some women, you mean.  but what success has your honour's\\nmodesty been crowned with now, that it grows so insolent upon us?\\n\\nmarlow.  didn't you see the tempting, brisk, lovely little thing, that\\nruns about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle?\\n\\nhastings.  well, and what then?\\n\\nmarlow.  she's mine, you rogue you.  such fire, such motion, such\\neyes, such lips; but, egad! she would not let me kiss them though.\\n\\nhastings.  but are you so sure, so very sure of her?\\n\\nmarlow.  why, man, she talked of showing me her work above stairs, and\\ni am to improve the pattern.\\n\\nhastings.  but how can you, charles, go about to rob a woman of her\\nhonour?\\n\\nmarlow.  pshaw! pshaw!  we all know the honour of the bar-maid of an\\ninn.  i don't intend to rob her, take my word for it; there's nothing\\nin this house i shan't honestly pay for.\\n\\nhastings.  i believe the girl has virtue.\\n\\nmarlow.  and if she has, i should be the last man in the world that\\nwould attempt to corrupt it.\\n\\nhastings.  you have taken care, i hope, of the casket i sent you to\\nlock up?  is it in safety?\\n\\nmarlow.  yes, yes.  it's safe enough.  i have taken care of it.  but\\nhow could you think the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door a place of\\nsafety?  ah! numskull!  i have taken better precautions for you than\\nyou did for yourself----i have----\\n\\nhastings.  what?\\n\\nmarlow.  i have sent it to the landlady to keep for you.\\n\\nhastings.  to the landlady!\\n\\nmarlow.  the landlady.\\n\\nhastings.  you did?\\n\\nmarlow.  i did.  she's to be answerable for its forthcoming, you know.\\n\\nhastings.  yes, she'll bring it forth with a witness.\\n\\nmarlow.  wasn't i right?  i believe you'll allow that i acted\\nprudently upon this occasion.\\n\\nhastings.  (aside.)  he must not see my uneasiness.\\n\\nmarlow.  you seem a little disconcerted though, methinks.  sure\\nnothing has happened?\\n\\nhastings.  no, nothing.  never was in better spirits in all my life.\\nand so you left it with the landlady, who, no doubt, very readily\\nundertook the charge.\\n\\nmarlow.  rather too readily.  for she not only kept the casket, but,\\nthrough her great precaution, was going to keep the messenger too.  ha!\\nha! ha!\\n\\nhastings.  he! he! he!  they're safe, however.\\n\\nmarlow.  as a guinea in a miser's purse.\\n\\nhastings.  (aside.)  so now all hopes of fortune are at an end, and we\\nmust set off without it.  (to him.)  well, charles, i'll leave you to\\nyour meditations on the pretty bar-maid, and, he! he! he! may you be as\\nsuccessful for yourself, as you have been for me!  [exit.]\\n\\nmarlow.  thank ye, george: i ask no more.  ha! ha! ha!\\n\\n\\nenter hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  i no longer know my own house.  it's turned all\\ntopsy-turvy.  his servants have got drunk already.  i'll bear it no\\nlonger; and yet, from my respect for his father, i'll be calm.  (to\\nhim.)  mr. marlow, your servant.  i'm your very humble servant.\\n(bowing low.)\\n\\nmarlow.  sir, your humble servant.  (aside.)  what's to be the wonder\\nnow?\\n\\nhardcastle.  i believe, sir, you must be sensible, sir, that no man\\nalive ought to be more welcome than your father's son, sir.  i hope you\\nthink so?\\n\\nmarlow.  i do from my soul, sir.  i don't want much entreaty.  i\\ngenerally make my father's son welcome wherever he goes.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i believe you do, from my soul, sir.  but though i say\\nnothing to your own conduct, that of your servants is insufferable.\\ntheir manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house,\\ni assure you.\\n\\nmarlow.  i protest, my very good sir, that is no fault of mine.  if\\nthey don't drink as they ought, they are to blame.  i ordered them not\\nto spare the cellar.  i did, i assure you.  (to the side scene.)  here,\\nlet one of my servants come up.  (to him.)  my positive directions\\nwere, that as i did not drink myself, they should make up for my\\ndeficiencies below.\\n\\nhardcastle.  then they had your orders for what they do?  i'm\\nsatisfied!\\n\\nmarlow.  they had, i assure you.  you shall hear from one of\\nthemselves.\\n\\n\\nenter servant, drunk.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  you, jeremy!  come forward, sirrah!  what were my orders?\\nwere you not told to drink freely, and call for what you thought fit,\\nfor the good of the house?\\n\\nhardcastle.  (aside.)  i begin to lose my patience.\\n\\njeremy.  please your honour, liberty and fleet-street for ever!\\nthough i'm but a servant, i'm as good as another man.  i'll drink for\\nno man before supper, sir, damme!  good liquor will sit upon a good\\nsupper, but a good supper will not sit upon----hiccup----on my\\nconscience, sir.\\n\\nmarlow.  you see, my old friend, the fellow is as drunk as he can\\npossibly be.  i don't know what you'd have more, unless you'd have the\\npoor devil soused in a beer-barrel.\\n\\nhardcastle.  zounds! he'll drive me distracted, if i contain myself any\\nlonger.  mr. marlow--sir; i have submitted to your insolence for more\\nthan four hours, and i see no likelihood of its coming to an end.  i'm\\nnow resolved to be master here, sir; and i desire that you and your\\ndrunken pack may leave my house directly.\\n\\nmarlow.  leave your house!----sure you jest, my good friend!  what?\\nwhen i'm doing what i can to please you.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i tell you, sir, you don't please me; so i desire you'll\\nleave my house.\\n\\nmarlow.  sure you cannot be serious?  at this time o' night, and such a\\nnight?  you only mean to banter me.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i tell you, sir, i'm serious! and now that my passions are\\nroused, i say this house is mine, sir; this house is mine, and i\\ncommand you to leave it directly.\\n\\nmarlow.  ha! ha! ha!  a puddle in a storm.  i shan't stir a step, i\\nassure you.  (in a serious tone.)  this your house, fellow!  it's my\\nhouse.  this is my house.  mine, while i choose to stay.  what right\\nhave you to bid me leave this house, sir?  i never met with such\\nimpudence, curse me; never in my whole life before.\\n\\nhardcastle.  nor i, confound me if ever i did.  to come to my house, to\\ncall for what he likes, to turn me out of my own chair, to insult the\\nfamily, to order his servants to get drunk, and then to tell me, \\\"this\\nhouse is mine, sir.\\\"  by all that's impudent, it makes me laugh.  ha!\\nha! ha!  pray, sir (bantering), as you take the house, what think you\\nof taking the rest of the furniture?  there's a pair of silver\\ncandlesticks, and there's a fire-screen, and here's a pair of\\nbrazen-nosed bellows; perhaps you may take a fancy to them?\\n\\nmarlow.  bring me your bill, sir; bring me your bill, and let's make no\\nmore words about it.\\n\\nhardcastle.  there are a set of prints, too.  what think you of the\\nrake's progress, for your own apartment?\\n\\nmarlow.  bring me your bill, i say; and i'll leave you and your\\ninfernal house directly.\\n\\nhardcastle.  then there's a mahogany table that you may see your own\\nface in.\\n\\nmarlow.  my bill, i say.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i had forgot the great chair for your own particular\\nslumbers, after a hearty meal.\\n\\nmarlow.  zounds! bring me my bill, i say, and let's hear no more on't.\\n\\nhardcastle.  young man, young man, from your father's letter to me, i\\nwas taught to expect a well-bred modest man as a visitor here, but now\\ni find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully; but he will be down\\nhere presently, and shall hear more of it.  [exit.]\\n\\nmarlow.  how's this?  sure i have not mistaken the house.  everything\\nlooks like an inn.  the servants cry, coming; the attendance is\\nawkward; the bar-maid, too, to attend us.  but she's here, and will\\nfurther inform me.  whither so fast, child?  a word with you.\\n\\n\\nenter miss hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  let it be short, then.  i'm in a hurry.  (aside.)  i\\nbelieve be begins to find out his mistake.  but it's too soon quite to\\nundeceive him.\\n\\nmarlow.  pray, child, answer me one question.  what are you, and what\\nmay your business in this house be?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  a relation of the family, sir.\\n\\nmarlow.  what, a poor relation.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  yes, sir.  a poor relation, appointed to keep the\\nkeys, and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them.\\n\\nmarlow.  that is, you act as the bar-maid of this inn.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  inn!  o law----what brought that in your head?  one\\nof the best families in the country keep an inn--ha! ha! ha! old mr.\\nhardcastle's house an inn!\\n\\nmarlow.  mr. hardcastle's house!  is this mr. hardcastle's house,\\nchild?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  ay, sure!  whose else should it be?\\n\\nmarlow.  so then, all's out, and i have been damnably imposed on.  o,\\nconfound my stupid head, i shall be laughed at over the whole town.  i\\nshall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops.  the dullissimo\\nmaccaroni.  to mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my\\nfather's old friend for an innkeeper!  what a swaggering puppy must he\\ntake me for!  what a silly puppy do i find myself!  there again, may i\\nbe hanged, my dear, but i mistook you for the bar-maid.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  dear me! dear me!  i'm sure there's nothing in my\\nbehaviour to put me on a level with one of that stamp.\\n\\nmarlow.  nothing, my dear, nothing.  but i was in for a list of\\nblunders, and could not help making you a subscriber.  my stupidity saw\\neverything the wrong way.  i mistook your assiduity for assurance, and\\nyour simplicity for allurement.  but it's over.  this house i no more\\nshow my face in.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i hope, sir, i have done nothing to disoblige you.\\ni'm sure i should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so\\npolite, and said so many civil things to me.  i'm sure i should be\\nsorry (pretending to cry) if he left the family upon my account.  i'm\\nsure i should be sorry if people said anything amiss, since i have no\\nfortune but my character.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  by heaven! she weeps.  this is the first mark of\\ntenderness i ever had from a modest woman, and it touches me.  (to\\nher.)  excuse me, my lovely girl; you are the only part of the family i\\nleave with reluctance.  but to be plain with you, the difference of our\\nbirth, fortune, and education, makes an honourable connexion\\nimpossible; and i can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity\\nthat trusted in my honour, of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault\\nwas being too lovely.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (aside.)  generous man!  i now begin to admire him.\\n(to him.)  but i am sure my family is as good as miss hardcastle's; and\\nthough i'm poor, that's no great misfortune to a contented mind; and,\\nuntil this moment, i never thought that it was bad to want fortune.\\n\\nmarlow.  and why now, my pretty simplicity?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  because it puts me at a distance from one that, if i\\nhad a thousand pounds, i would give it all to.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  this simplicity bewitches me, so that if i stay, i'm\\nundone.  i must make one bold effort, and leave her.  (to her.)  your\\npartiality in my favour, my dear, touches me most sensibly: and were i\\nto live for myself alone, i could easily fix my choice.  but i owe too\\nmuch to the opinion of the world, too much to the authority of a\\nfather; so that--i can scarcely speak it--it affects me.  farewell.\\n[exit.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i never knew half his merit till now.  he shall not\\ngo, if i have power or art to detain him.  i'll still preserve the\\ncharacter in which i stooped to conquer; but will undeceive my papa,\\nwho perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution.  [exit.]\\n\\n\\nenter tony and miss neville.\\n\\n\\ntony.  ay, you may steal for yourselves the next time.  i have done my\\nduty.  she has got the jewels again, that's a sure thing; but she\\nbelieves it was all a mistake of the servants.\\n\\nmiss neville.  but, my dear cousin, sure you won't forsake us in this\\ndistress?  if she in the least suspects that i am going off, i shall\\ncertainly be locked up, or sent to my aunt pedigree's, which is ten\\ntimes worse.\\n\\ntony.  to be sure, aunts of all kinds are damned bad things.  but what\\ncan i do?  i have got you a pair of horses that will fly like\\nwhistle-jacket; and i'm sure you can't say but i have courted you\\nnicely before her face.  here she comes, we must court a bit or two\\nmore, for fear she should suspect us.  [they retire, and seem to\\nfondle.]\\n\\n\\nenter mrs. hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  well, i was greatly fluttered, to be sure.  but my\\nson tells me it was all a mistake of the servants.  i shan't be easy,\\nhowever, till they are fairly married, and then let her keep her own\\nfortune.  but what do i see? fondling together, as i'm alive.  i never\\nsaw tony so sprightly before.  ah! have i caught you, my pretty doves?\\nwhat, billing, exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs?  ah!\\n\\ntony.  as for murmurs, mother, we grumble a little now and then, to be\\nsure.  but there's no love lost between us.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  a mere sprinkling, tony, upon the flame, only to make\\nit burn brighter.\\n\\nmiss neville.  cousin tony promises to give us more of his company at\\nhome.  indeed, he shan't leave us any more.  it won't leave us, cousin\\ntony, will it?\\n\\ntony.  o! it's a pretty creature.  no, i'd sooner leave my horse in a\\npound, than leave you when you smile upon one so.  your laugh makes you\\nso becoming.\\n\\nmiss neville.  agreeable cousin!  who can help admiring that natural\\nhumour, that pleasant, broad, red, thoughtless (patting his cheek)--ah!\\nit's a bold face.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  pretty innocence!\\n\\ntony.  i'm sure i always loved cousin con.'s hazle eyes, and her\\npretty long fingers, that she twists this way and that over the\\nhaspicholls, like a parcel of bobbins.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  ah! he would charm the bird from the tree.  i was\\nnever so happy before.  my boy takes after his father, poor mr.\\nlumpkin, exactly.  the jewels, my dear con., shall be yours\\nincontinently.  you shall have them.  isn't he a sweet boy, my dear?\\nyou shall be married to-morrow, and we'll put off the rest of his\\neducation, like dr. drowsy's sermons, to a fitter opportunity.\\n\\n\\nenter diggory.\\n\\n\\ndiggory.  where's the 'squire?  i have got a letter for your worship.\\n\\ntony.  give it to my mamma.  she reads all my letters first.\\n\\ndiggory.  i had orders to deliver it into your own hands.\\n\\ntony.  who does it come from?\\n\\ndiggory.  your worship mun ask that o' the letter itself.\\n\\ntony.  i could wish to know though (turning the letter, and gazing on\\nit).\\n\\nmiss neville.  (aside.)  undone! undone!  a letter to him from\\nhastings.  i know the hand.  if my aunt sees it, we are ruined for\\never.  i'll keep her employed a little if i can.  (to mrs.\\nhardcastle.)  but i have not told you, madam, of my cousin's smart\\nanswer just now to mr. marlow.  we so laughed.--you must know,\\nmadam.--this way a little, for he must not hear us.  [they confer.]\\n\\ntony.  (still gazing.)  a damned cramp piece of penmanship, as ever i\\nsaw in my life.  i can read your print hand very well.  but here are\\nsuch handles, and shanks, and dashes, that one can scarce tell the head\\nfrom the tail.--\\\"to anthony lumpkin, esquire.\\\"  it's very odd, i can\\nread the outside of my letters, where my own name is, well enough; but\\nwhen i come to open it, it's all----buzz.  that's hard, very hard; for\\nthe inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  ha! ha! ha!  very well, very well.  and so my son was\\ntoo hard for the philosopher.\\n\\nmiss neville.  yes, madam; but you must hear the rest, madam.  a\\nlittle more this way, or he may hear us.  you'll hear how he puzzled\\nhim again.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  he seems strangely puzzled now himself, methinks.\\n\\ntony.  (still gazing.)  a damned up and down hand, as if it was\\ndisguised in liquor.--(reading.)  dear sir,--ay, that's that.  then\\nthere's an m, and a t, and an s, but whether the next be an izzard, or\\nan r, confound me, i cannot tell.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  what's that, my dear?  can i give you any\\nassistance?\\n\\nmiss neville.  pray, aunt, let me read it.  nobody reads a cramp hand\\nbetter than i. (twitching the letter from him.)  do you know who it is\\nfrom?\\n\\ntony.  can't tell, except from dick ginger, the feeder.\\n\\nmiss neville.  ay, so it is.  (pretending to read.)  dear 'squire,\\nhoping that you're in health, as i am at this present.  the gentlemen\\nof the shake-bag club has cut the gentlemen of goose-green quite out of\\nfeather.  the odds--um--odd battle--um--long fighting--um--here, here,\\nit's all about cocks and fighting; it's of no consequence; here, put it\\nup, put it up.  (thrusting the crumpled letter upon him.)\\n\\ntony.  but i tell you, miss, it's of all the consequence in the world.\\ni would not lose the rest of it for a guinea.  here, mother, do you\\nmake it out.  of no consequence!  (giving mrs. hardcastle the letter.)\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  how's this?--(reads.)  \\\"dear 'squire, i'm now\\nwaiting for miss neville, with a post-chaise and pair, at the bottom of\\nthe garden, but i find my horses yet unable to perform the journey.  i\\nexpect you'll assist us with a pair of fresh horses, as you promised.\\ndispatch is necessary, as the hag (ay, the hag), your mother, will\\notherwise suspect us!  yours, hastings.\\\"  grant me patience.  i shall\\nrun distracted!  my rage chokes me.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i hope, madam, you'll suspend your resentment for a few\\nmoments, and not impute to me any impertinence, or sinister design,\\nthat belongs to another.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (curtseying very low.)  fine spoken, madam, you are\\nmost miraculously polite and engaging, and quite the very pink of\\ncourtesy and circumspection, madam.  (changing her tone.)  and you, you\\ngreat ill-fashioned oaf, with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth\\nshut: were you, too, joined against me?  but i'll defeat all your plots\\nin a moment.  as for you, madam, since you have got a pair of fresh\\nhorses ready, it would be cruel to disappoint them.  so, if you please,\\ninstead of running away with your spark, prepare, this very moment, to\\nrun off with me.  your old aunt pedigree will keep you secure, i'll\\nwarrant me.  you too, sir, may mount your horse, and guard us upon the\\nway.  here, thomas, roger, diggory!  i'll show you, that i wish you\\nbetter than you do yourselves.  [exit.]\\n\\nmiss neville.  so now i'm completely ruined.\\n\\ntony.  ay, that's a sure thing.\\n\\nmiss neville.  what better could be expected from being connected with\\nsuch a stupid fool,--and after all the nods and signs i made him?\\n\\ntony.  by the laws, miss, it was your own cleverness, and not my\\nstupidity, that did your business.  you were so nice and so busy with\\nyour shake-bags and goose-greens, that i thought you could never be\\nmaking believe.\\n\\n\\nenter hastings.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  so, sir, i find by my servant, that you have shown my\\nletter, and betrayed us.  was this well done, young gentleman?\\n\\ntony.  here's another.  ask miss there, who betrayed you.  ecod, it was\\nher doing, not mine.\\n\\n\\nenter marlow.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  so i have been finely used here among you.  rendered\\ncontemptible, driven into ill manners, despised, insulted, laughed at.\\n\\ntony.  here's another.  we shall have old bedlam broke loose\\npresently.\\n\\nmiss neville.  and there, sir, is the gentleman to whom we all owe\\nevery obligation.\\n\\nmarlow.  what can i say to him, a mere boy, an idiot, whose ignorance\\nand age are a protection?\\n\\nhastings.  a poor contemptible booby, that would but disgrace\\ncorrection.\\n\\nmiss neville.  yet with cunning and malice enough to make himself\\nmerry with all our embarrassments.\\n\\nhastings.  an insensible cub.\\n\\nmarlow.  replete with tricks and mischief.\\n\\ntony.  baw! damme, but i'll fight you both, one after the\\nother----with baskets.\\n\\nmarlow.  as for him, he's below resentment.  but your conduct, mr.\\nhastings, requires an explanation.  you knew of my mistakes, yet would\\nnot undeceive me.\\n\\nhastings.  tortured as i am with my own disappointments, is this a time\\nfor explanations?  it is not friendly, mr. marlow.\\n\\nmarlow.  but, sir----\\n\\nmiss neville.  mr. marlow, we never kept on your mistake till it was\\ntoo late to undeceive you.\\n\\n\\nenter servant.\\n\\n\\nservant.  my mistress desires you'll get ready immediately, madam.  the\\nhorses are putting to.  your hat and things are in the next room.  we\\nare to go thirty miles before morning.  [exit servant.]\\n\\nmiss neville.  well, well: i'll come presently.\\n\\nmarlow.  (to hastings.)  was it well done, sir, to assist in rendering\\nme ridiculous?  to hang me out for the scorn of all my acquaintance?\\ndepend upon it, sir, i shall expect an explanation.\\n\\nhastings.  was it well done, sir, if you're upon that subject, to\\ndeliver what i entrusted to yourself, to the care of another sir?\\n\\nmiss neville.  mr. hastings!  mr. marlow!  why will you increase my\\ndistress by this groundless dispute?  i implore, i entreat you----\\n\\n\\nenter servant.\\n\\n\\nservant.  your cloak, madam.  my mistress is impatient.  [exit\\nservant.]\\n\\nmiss neville.  i come.  pray be pacified.  if i leave you thus, i\\nshall die with apprehension.\\n\\n\\nenter servant.\\n\\n\\nservant.  your fan, muff, and gloves, madam.  the horses are waiting.\\n\\nmiss neville.  o, mr. marlow! if you knew what a scene of constraint\\nand ill-nature lies before me, i'm sure it would convert your\\nresentment into pity.\\n\\nmarlow.  i'm so distracted with a variety of passions, that i don't\\nknow what i do.  forgive me, madam.  george, forgive me.  you know my\\nhasty temper, and should not exasperate it.\\n\\nhastings.  the torture of my situation is my only excuse.\\n\\nmiss neville.  well, my dear hastings, if you have that esteem for me\\nthat i think, that i am sure you have, your constancy for three years\\nwill but increase the happiness of our future connexion.  if----\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (within.)  miss neville.  constance, why constance, i\\nsay.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i'm coming.  well, constancy, remember, constancy is the\\nword.  [exit.]\\n\\nhastings.  my heart! how can i support this?  to be so near happiness,\\nand such happiness!\\n\\nmarlow.  (to tony.)  you see now, young gentleman, the effects of your\\nfolly.  what might be amusement to you, is here disappointment, and\\neven distress.\\n\\ntony.  (from a reverie.)  ecod, i have hit it.  it's here.  your\\nhands.  yours and yours, my poor sulky!--my boots there, ho!--meet me\\ntwo hours hence at the bottom of the garden; and if you don't find tony\\nlumpkin a more good-natured fellow than you thought for, i'll give you\\nleave to take my best horse, and bet bouncer into the bargain.  come\\nalong.  my boots, ho!  [exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nenter hastings and servant.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  you saw the old lady and miss neville drive off, you say?\\n\\nservant.  yes, your honour.  they went off in a post-coach, and the\\nyoung 'squire went on horseback.  they're thirty miles off by this\\ntime.\\n\\nhastings.  then all my hopes are over.\\n\\nservant.  yes, sir.  old sir charles has arrived.  he and the old\\ngentleman of the house have been laughing at mr. marlow's mistake this\\nhalf hour.  they are coming this way.\\n\\nhastings.  then i must not be seen.  so now to my fruitless\\nappointment at the bottom of the garden.  this is about the time.\\n[exit.]\\n\\n\\nenter sir charles and hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  ha! ha! ha!  the peremptory tone in which he sent forth\\nhis sublime commands!\\n\\nsir charles.  and the reserve with which i suppose he treated all your\\nadvances.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and yet he might have seen something in me above a common\\ninnkeeper, too.\\n\\nsir charles.  yes, dick, but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper,\\nha! ha! ha!\\n\\nhardcastle.  well, i'm in too good spirits to think of anything but\\njoy.  yes, my dear friend, this union of our families will make our\\npersonal friendships hereditary; and though my daughter's fortune is\\nbut small--\\n\\nsir charles.  why, dick, will you talk of fortune to me?  my son is\\npossessed of more than a competence already, and can want nothing but a\\ngood and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it.  if they\\nlike each other, as you say they do--\\n\\nhardcastle.  if, man!  i tell you they do like each other.  my\\ndaughter as good as told me so.\\n\\nsir charles.  but girls are apt to flatter themselves, you know.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself; and\\nhere he comes to put you out of your ifs, i warrant him.\\n\\n\\nenter marlow.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  i come, sir, once more, to ask pardon for my strange conduct.\\ni can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion.\\n\\nhardcastle.  tut, boy, a trifle!  you take it too gravely.  an hour or\\ntwo's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again.  she'll\\nnever like you the worse for it.\\n\\nmarlow.  sir, i shall be always proud of her approbation.\\n\\nhardcastle.  approbation is but a cold word, mr. marlow; if i am not\\ndeceived, you have something more than approbation thereabouts.  you\\ntake me?\\n\\nmarlow.  really, sir, i have not that happiness.\\n\\nhardcastle.  come, boy, i'm an old fellow, and know what's what as well\\nas you that are younger.  i know what has passed between you; but mum.\\n\\nmarlow.  sure, sir, nothing has passed between us but the most\\nprofound respect on my side, and the most distant reserve on hers.  you\\ndon't think, sir, that my impudence has been passed upon all the rest\\nof the family.\\n\\nhardcastle.  impudence!  no, i don't say that--not quite\\nimpudence--though girls like to be played with, and rumpled a little\\ntoo, sometimes.  but she has told no tales, i assure you.\\n\\nmarlow.  i never gave her the slightest cause.\\n\\nhardcastle.  well, well, i like modesty in its place well enough.  but\\nthis is over-acting, young gentleman.  you may be open.  your father\\nand i will like you all the better for it.\\n\\nmarlow.  may i die, sir, if i ever----\\n\\nhardcastle.  i tell you, she don't dislike you; and as i'm sure you\\nlike her----\\n\\nmarlow.  dear sir--i protest, sir----\\n\\nhardcastle.  i see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as\\nthe parson can tie you.\\n\\nmarlow.  but hear me, sir--\\n\\nhardcastle.  your father approves the match, i admire it; every\\nmoment's delay will be doing mischief.  so--\\n\\nmarlow.  but why won't you hear me?  by all that's just and true, i\\nnever gave miss hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment, or even\\nthe most distant hint to suspect me of affection.  we had but one\\ninterview, and that was formal, modest, and uninteresting.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (aside.)  this fellow's formal modest impudence is beyond\\nbearing.\\n\\nsir charles.  and you never grasped her hand, or made any\\nprotestations?\\n\\nmarlow.  as heaven is my witness, i came down in obedience to your\\ncommands.  i saw the lady without emotion, and parted without\\nreluctance.  i hope you'll exact no farther proofs of my duty, nor\\nprevent me from leaving a house in which i suffer so many\\nmortifications.  [exit.]\\n\\nsir charles.  i'm astonished at the air of sincerity with which he\\nparted.\\n\\nhardcastle.  and i'm astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his\\nassurance.\\n\\nsir charles.  i dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth.\\n\\nhardcastle.  here comes my daughter, and i would stake my happiness\\nupon her veracity.\\n\\n\\nenter miss hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  kate, come hither, child.  answer us sincerely and\\nwithout reserve: has mr. marlow made you any professions of love and\\naffection?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  the question is very abrupt, sir.  but since you\\nrequire unreserved sincerity, i think he has.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (to sir charles.)  you see.\\n\\nsir charles.  and pray, madam, have you and my son had more than one\\ninterview?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  yes, sir, several.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (to sir charles.)  you see.\\n\\nsir charles.  but did be profess any attachment?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  a lasting one.\\n\\nsir charles.  did he talk of love?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  much, sir.\\n\\nsir charles.  amazing!  and all this formally?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  formally.\\n\\nhardcastle.  now, my friend, i hope you are satisfied.\\n\\nsir charles.  and how did he behave, madam?\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  as most profest admirers do: said some civil things\\nof my face, talked much of his want of merit, and the greatness of\\nmine; mentioned his heart, gave a short tragedy speech, and ended with\\npretended rapture.\\n\\nsir charles.  now i'm perfectly convinced, indeed.  i know his\\nconversation among women to be modest and submissive: this forward\\ncanting ranting manner by no means describes him; and, i am confident,\\nhe never sat for the picture.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  then, what, sir, if i should convince you to your\\nface of my sincerity?  if you and my papa, in about half an hour, will\\nplace yourselves behind that screen, you shall hear him declare his\\npassion to me in person.\\n\\nsir charles.  agreed.  and if i find him what you describe, all my\\nhappiness in him must have an end.  [exit.]\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  and if you don't find him what i describe--i fear my\\nhappiness must never have a beginning.  [exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nscene changes to the back of the garden.\\n\\n\\nenter hastings.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  what an idiot am i, to wait here for a fellow who probably\\ntakes a delight in mortifying me.  he never intended to be punctual,\\nand i'll wait no longer.  what do i see?  it is he! and perhaps with\\nnews of my constance.\\n\\n\\nenter tony, booted and spattered.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  my honest 'squire!  i now find you a man of your word.\\nthis looks like friendship.\\n\\ntony.  ay, i'm your friend, and the best friend you have in the world,\\nif you knew but all.  this riding by night, by the bye, is cursedly\\ntiresome.  it has shook me worse than the basket of a stage-coach.\\n\\nhastings.  but how? where did you leave your fellow-travellers?  are\\nthey in safety?  are they housed?\\n\\ntony.  five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad\\ndriving.  the poor beasts have smoked for it: rabbit me, but i'd rather\\nride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment.\\n\\nhastings.  well, but where have you left the ladies?  i die with\\nimpatience.\\n\\ntony.  left them!  why where should i leave them but where i found\\nthem?\\n\\nhastings.  this is a riddle.\\n\\ntony.  riddle me this then.  what's that goes round the house, and\\nround the house, and never touches the house?\\n\\nhastings.  i'm still astray.\\n\\ntony.  why, that's it, mon.  i have led them astray.  by jingo,\\nthere's not a pond or a slough within five miles of the place but they\\ncan tell the taste of.\\n\\nhastings.  ha! ha! ha! i understand: you took them in a round, while\\nthey supposed themselves going forward, and so you have at last brought\\nthem home again.\\n\\ntony.  you shall hear.  i first took them down feather-bed lane, where\\nwe stuck fast in the mud.  i then rattled them crack over the stones of\\nup-and-down hill.  i then introduced them to the gibbet on heavy-tree\\nheath; and from that, with a circumbendibus, i fairly lodged them in\\nthe horse-pond at the bottom of the garden.\\n\\nhastings.  but no accident, i hope?\\n\\ntony.  no, no.  only mother is confoundedly frightened.  she thinks\\nherself forty miles off.  she's sick of the journey; and the cattle can\\nscarce crawl.  so if your own horses be ready, you may whip off with\\ncousin, and i'll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow\\nyou.\\n\\nhastings.  my dear friend, how can i be grateful?\\n\\ntony.  ay, now it's dear friend, noble 'squire.  just now, it was all\\nidiot, cub, and run me through the guts.  damn your way of fighting, i\\nsay.  after we take a knock in this part of the country, we kiss and be\\nfriends.  but if you had run me through the guts, then i should be\\ndead, and you might go kiss the hangman.\\n\\nhastings.  the rebuke is just.  but i must hasten to relieve miss\\nneville: if you keep the old lady employed, i promise to take care of\\nthe young one.  [exit hastings.]\\n\\ntony.  never fear me.  here she comes.  vanish.  she's got from the\\npond, and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid.\\n\\n\\nenter mrs. hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  oh, tony, i'm killed!  shook!  battered to death.  i\\nshall never survive it.  that last jolt, that laid us against the\\nquickset hedge, has done my business.\\n\\ntony.  alack, mamma, it was all your own fault.  you would be for\\nrunning away by night, without knowing one inch of the way.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  i wish we were at home again.  i never met so many\\naccidents in so short a journey.  drenched in the mud, overturned in a\\nditch, stuck fast in a slough, jolted to a jelly, and at last to lose\\nour way.  whereabouts do you think we are, tony?\\n\\ntony.  by my guess we should come upon crackskull common, about forty\\nmiles from home.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  o lud! o lud!  the most notorious spot in all the\\ncountry.  we only want a robbery to make a complete night on't.\\n\\ntony.  don't be afraid, mamma, don't be afraid.  two of the five that\\nkept here are hanged, and the other three may not find us.  don't be\\nafraid.--is that a man that's galloping behind us?  no; it's only a\\ntree.--don't be afraid.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  the fright will certainly kill me.\\n\\ntony.  do you see anything like a black hat moving behind the thicket?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  oh, death!\\n\\ntony.  no; it's only a cow.  don't be afraid, mamma; don't be afraid.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  as i'm alive, tony, i see a man coming towards us.\\nah!  i'm sure on't.  if he perceives us, we are undone.\\n\\ntony.  (aside.)  father-in-law, by all that's unlucky, come to take one\\nof his night walks.  (to her.)  ah, it's a highwayman with pistols as\\nlong as my arm.  a damned ill-looking fellow.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  good heaven defend us!  he approaches.\\n\\ntony.  do you hide yourself in that thicket, and leave me to manage\\nhim.  if there be any danger, i'll cough, and cry hem.  when i cough,\\nbe sure to keep close.  (mrs. hardcastle hides behind a tree in the\\nback scene.)\\n\\n\\nenter hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nhardcastle.  i'm mistaken, or i heard voices of people in want of\\nhelp.  oh, tony! is that you?  i did not expect you so soon back.  are\\nyour mother and her charge in safety?\\n\\ntony.  very safe, sir, at my aunt pedigree's.  hem.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (from behind.)  ah, death!  i find there's danger.\\n\\nhardcastle.  forty miles in three hours; sure that's too much, my\\nyoungster.\\n\\ntony.  stout horses and willing minds make short journeys, as they say.\\nhem.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (from behind.)  sure he'll do the dear boy no harm.\\n\\nhardcastle.  but i heard a voice here; i should be glad to know from\\nwhence it came.\\n\\ntony.  it was i, sir, talking to myself, sir.  i was saying that forty\\nmiles in four hours was very good going.  hem.  as to be sure it was.\\nhem.  i have got a sort of cold by being out in the air.  we'll go in,\\nif you please.  hem.\\n\\nhardcastle.  but if you talked to yourself you did not answer\\nyourself.  i'm certain i heard two voices, and am resolved (raising his\\nvoice) to find the other out.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (from behind.)  oh! he's coming to find me out.  oh!\\n\\ntony.  what need you go, sir, if i tell you?  hem.  i'll lay down my\\nlife for the truth--hem--i'll tell you all, sir.  [detaining him.]\\n\\nhardcastle.  i tell you i will not be detained.  i insist on seeing.\\nit's in vain to expect i'll believe you.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (running forward from behind.)  o lud! he'll murder\\nmy poor boy, my darling!  here, good gentleman, whet your rage upon me.\\ntake my money, my life, but spare that young gentleman; spare my child,\\nif you have any mercy.\\n\\nhardcastle.  my wife, as i'm a christian.  from whence can she come? or\\nwhat does she mean?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (kneeling.)  take compassion on us, good mr.\\nhighwayman.  take our money, our watches, all we have, but spare our\\nlives.  we will never bring you to justice; indeed we won't, good mr.\\nhighwayman.\\n\\nhardcastle.  i believe the woman's out of her senses.  what, dorothy,\\ndon't you know me?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  mr. hardcastle, as i'm alive!  my fears blinded me.\\nbut who, my dear, could have expected to meet you here, in this\\nfrightful place, so far from home?  what has brought you to follow us?\\n\\nhardcastle.  sure, dorothy, you have not lost your wits?  so far from\\nhome, when you are within forty yards of your own door!  (to him.)\\nthis is one of your old tricks, you graceless rogue, you.  (to her.)\\ndon't you know the gate, and the mulberry-tree; and don't you remember\\nthe horse-pond, my dear?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  yes, i shall remember the horse-pond as long as i\\nlive; i have caught my death in it.  (to tony.)  and it is to you, you\\ngraceless varlet, i owe all this?  i'll teach you to abuse your mother,\\ni will.\\n\\ntony.  ecod, mother, all the parish says you have spoiled me, and so\\nyou may take the fruits on't.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  i'll spoil you, i will.  [follows him off the stage.\\nexit.]\\n\\nhardcastle.  there's morality, however, in his reply.  [exit.]\\n\\n\\nenter hastings and miss neville.\\n\\n\\nhastings.  my dear constance, why will you deliberate thus?  if we\\ndelay a moment, all is lost for ever.  pluck up a little resolution,\\nand we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity.\\n\\nmiss neville.  i find it impossible.  my spirits are so sunk with the\\nagitations i have suffered, that i am unable to face any new danger.\\ntwo or three years' patience will at last crown us with happiness.\\n\\nhastings.  such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy.  let us fly,\\nmy charmer.  let us date our happiness from this very moment.  perish\\nfortune!  love and content will increase what we possess beyond a\\nmonarch's revenue.  let me prevail!\\n\\nmiss neville.  no, mr. hastings, no.  prudence once more comes to my\\nrelief, and i will obey its dictates.  in the moment of passion fortune\\nmay be despised, but it ever produces a lasting repentance.  i'm\\nresolved to apply to mr. hardcastle's compassion and justice for\\nredress.\\n\\nhastings.  but though he had the will, he has not the power to relieve\\nyou.\\n\\nmiss neville.  but he has influence, and upon that i am resolved to\\nrely.\\n\\nhastings.  i have no hopes.  but since you persist, i must reluctantly\\nobey you.  [exeunt.]\\n\\n\\nscene changes.\\n\\n\\nenter sir charles and miss hardcastle.\\n\\n\\nsir charles.  what a situation am i in!  if what you say appears, i\\nshall then find a guilty son.  if what he says be true, i shall then\\nlose one that, of all others, i most wished for a daughter.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  i am proud of your approbation, and to show i merit\\nit, if you place yourselves as i directed, you shall hear his explicit\\ndeclaration.  but he comes.\\n\\nsir charles.  i'll to your father, and keep him to the appointment.\\n[exit sir charles.]\\n\\n\\nenter marlow.\\n\\n\\nmarlow.  though prepared for setting out, i come once more to take\\nleave; nor did i, till this moment, know the pain i feel in the\\nseparation.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  (in her own natural manner.)  i believe sufferings\\ncannot be very great, sir, which you can so easily remove.  a day or\\ntwo longer, perhaps, might lessen your uneasiness, by showing the\\nlittle value of what you now think proper to regret.\\n\\nmarlow.  (aside.)  this girl every moment improves upon me.  (to her.)\\nit must not be, madam.  i have already trifled too long with my heart.\\nmy very pride begins to submit to my passion.  the disparity of\\neducation and fortune, the anger of a parent, and the contempt of my\\nequals, begin to lose their weight; and nothing can restore me to\\nmyself but this painful effort of resolution.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  then go, sir:  i'll urge nothing more to detain you.\\nthough my family be as good as hers you came down to visit, and my\\neducation, i hope, not inferior, what are these advantages without\\nequal affluence?  i must remain contented with the slight approbation\\nof imputed merit; i must have only the mockery of your addresses, while\\nall your serious aims are fixed on fortune.\\n\\n\\nenter hardcastle and sir charles from behind.\\n\\n\\nsir charles.  here, behind this screen.\\n\\nhardcastle.  ay, ay; make no noise.  i'll engage my kate covers him\\nwith confusion at last.\\n\\nmarlow.  by heavens, madam! fortune was ever my smallest\\nconsideration.  your beauty at first caught my eye; for who could see\\nthat without emotion?  but every moment that i converse with you steals\\nin some new grace, heightens the picture, and gives it stronger\\nexpression.  what at first seemed rustic plainness, now appears refined\\nsimplicity.  what seemed forward assurance, now strikes me as the\\nresult of courageous innocence and conscious virtue.\\n\\nsir charles.  what can it mean?  he amazes me!\\n\\nhardcastle.  i told you how it would be.  hush!\\n\\nmarlow.  i am now determined to stay, madam; and i have too good an\\nopinion of my father's discernment, when he sees you, to doubt his\\napprobation.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  no, mr. marlow, i will not, cannot detain you.  do\\nyou think i could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest\\nroom for repentance?  do you think i would take the mean advantage of a\\ntransient passion, to load you with confusion?  do you think i could\\never relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours?\\n\\nmarlow.  by all that's good, i can have no happiness but what's in your\\npower to grant me!  nor shall i ever feel repentance but in not having\\nseen your merits before.  i will stay even contrary to your wishes; and\\nthough you should persist to shun me, i will make my respectful\\nassiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct.\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  sir, i must entreat you'll desist.  as our\\nacquaintance began, so let it end, in indifference.  i might have\\ngiven an hour or two to levity; but seriously, mr. marlow, do you\\nthink i could ever submit to a connexion where i must appear\\nmercenary, and you imprudent?  do you think i could ever catch at the\\nconfident addresses of a secure admirer?\\n\\nmarlow.  (kneeling.)  does this look like security?  does this look\\nlike confidence?  no, madam, every moment that shows me your merit,\\nonly serves to increase my diffidence and confusion.  here let me\\ncontinue----\\n\\nsir charles.  i can hold it no longer.  charles, charles, how hast thou\\ndeceived me!  is this your indifference, your uninteresting\\nconversation?\\n\\nhardcastle.  your cold contempt; your formal interview!  what have you\\nto say now?\\n\\nmarlow.  that i'm all amazement!  what can it mean?\\n\\nhardcastle.  it means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure:\\nthat you can address a lady in private, and deny it in public: that you\\nhave one story for us, and another for my daughter.\\n\\nmarlow.  daughter!--this lady your daughter?\\n\\nhardcastle.  yes, sir, my only daughter; my kate; whose else should she\\nbe?\\n\\nmarlow.  oh, the devil!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  yes, sir, that very identical tall squinting lady you\\nwere pleased to take me for (courtseying); she that you addressed as\\nthe mild, modest, sentimental man of gravity, and the bold, forward,\\nagreeable rattle of the ladies' club.  ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nmarlow.  zounds! there's no bearing this; it's worse than death!\\n\\nmiss hardcastle.  in which of your characters, sir, will you give us\\nleave to address you?  as the faltering gentleman, with looks on the\\nground, that speaks just to be heard, and hates hypocrisy; or the loud\\nconfident creature, that keeps it up with mrs. mantrap, and old miss\\nbiddy buckskin, till three in the morning?  ha! ha! ha!\\n\\nmarlow.  o, curse on my noisy head.  i never attempted to be impudent\\nyet, that i was not taken down.  i must be gone.\\n\\nhardcastle.  by the hand of my body, but you shall not.  i see it was\\nall a mistake, and i am rejoiced to find it.  you shall not, sir, i\\ntell you.  i know she'll forgive you.  won't you forgive him, kate?\\nwe'll all forgive you.  take courage, man.  (they retire, she\\ntormenting him, to the back scene.)\\n\\n\\nenter mrs. hardcastle and tony.\\n\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  so, so, they're gone off.  let them go, i care not.\\n\\nhardcastle.  who gone?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  my dutiful niece and her gentleman, mr. hastings,\\nfrom town.  he who came down with our modest visitor here.\\n\\nsir charles.  who, my honest george hastings?  as worthy a fellow as\\nlives, and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice.\\n\\nhardcastle.  then, by the hand of my body, i'm proud of the connexion.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  well, if he has taken away the lady, he has not\\ntaken her fortune; that remains in this family to console us for her\\nloss.\\n\\nhardcastle.  sure, dorothy, you would not be so mercenary?\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  ay, that's my affair, not yours.\\n\\nhardcastle.  but you know if your son, when of age, refuses to marry\\nhis cousin, her whole fortune is then at her own disposal.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  ay, but he's not of age, and she has not thought\\nproper to wait for his refusal.\\n\\n\\nenter hastings and miss neville.\\n\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  (aside.)  what, returned so soon!  i begin not to\\nlike it.\\n\\nhastings.  (to hardcastle.)  for my late attempt to fly off with your\\nniece let my present confusion be my punishment.  we are now come back,\\nto appeal from your justice to your humanity.  by her father's consent,\\ni first paid her my addresses, and our passions were first founded in\\nduty.\\n\\nmiss neville.  since his death, i have been obliged to stoop to\\ndissimulation to avoid oppression.  in an hour of levity, i was ready\\nto give up my fortune to secure my choice.  but i am now recovered from\\nthe delusion, and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a\\nnearer connexion.\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  pshaw, pshaw! this is all but the whining end of a\\nmodern novel.\\n\\nhardcastle.  be it what it will, i'm glad they're come back to reclaim\\ntheir due.  come hither, tony, boy.  do you refuse this lady's hand\\nwhom i now offer you?\\n\\ntony.  what signifies my refusing?  you know i can't refuse her till\\ni'm of age, father.\\n\\nhardcastle.  while i thought concealing your age, boy, was likely to\\nconduce to your improvement, i concurred with your mother's desire to\\nkeep it secret.  but since i find she turns it to a wrong use, i must\\nnow declare you have been of age these three months.\\n\\ntony.  of age!  am i of age, father?\\n\\nhardcastle.  above three months.\\n\\ntony.  then you'll see the first use i'll make of my liberty.  (taking\\nmiss neville's hand.)  witness all men by these presents, that i,\\nanthony lumpkin, esquire, of blank place, refuse you, constantia\\nneville, spinster, of no place at all, for my true and lawful wife.  so\\nconstance neville may marry whom she pleases, and tony lumpkin is his\\nown man again.\\n\\nsir charles.  o brave 'squire!\\n\\nhastings.  my worthy friend!\\n\\nmrs. hardcastle.  my undutiful offspring!\\n\\nmarlow.  joy, my dear george!  i give you joy sincerely.  and could i\\nprevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary, i should be\\nthe happiest man alive, if you would return me the favour.\\n\\nhastings.  (to miss hardcastle.)  come, madam, you are now driven to\\nthe very last scene of all your contrivances.  i know you like him, i'm\\nsure he loves you, and you must and shall have him.\\n\\nhardcastle.  (joining their hands.)  and i say so too.  and, mr.\\nmarlow, if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter, i don't\\nbelieve you'll ever repent your bargain.  so now to supper.  to-morrow\\nwe shall gather all the poor of the parish about us, and the mistakes\\nof the night shall be crowned with a merry morning.  so, boy, take her;\\nand as you have been mistaken in the mistress, my wish is, that you may\\nnever be mistaken in the wife.  [exeunt omnes.]\",\n          \"on a january evening of the early seventies, christine nilsson was\\nsinging in faust at the academy of music in new york.\\n\\nthough there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan\\ndistances \\\"above the forties,\\\" of a new opera house which should\\ncompete in costliness and splendour with those of the great european\\ncapitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every\\nwinter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old academy.\\nconservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus\\nkeeping out the \\\"new people\\\" whom new york was beginning to dread and\\nyet be drawn to; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic\\nassociations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so\\nproblematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.\\n\\nit was madame nilsson's first appearance that winter, and what the\\ndaily press had already learned to describe as \\\"an exceptionally\\nbrilliant audience\\\" had gathered to hear her, transported through the\\nslippery, snowy streets in private broughams, in the spacious family\\nlandau, or in the humbler but more convenient \\\"brown coupe.\\\" to come to\\nthe opera in a brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving\\nas in one's own carriage; and departure by the same means had the\\nimmense advantage of enabling one (with a playful allusion to\\ndemocratic principles) to scramble into the first brown conveyance in\\nthe line, instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of\\none's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the academy.  it was\\none of the great livery-stableman's most masterly intuitions to have\\ndiscovered that americans want to get away from amusement even more\\nquickly than they want to get to it.\\n\\nwhen newland archer opened the door at the back of the club box the\\ncurtain had just gone up on the garden scene.  there was no reason why\\nthe young man should not have come earlier, for he had dined at seven,\\nalone with his mother and sister, and had lingered afterward over a\\ncigar in the gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and\\nfinial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where mrs.\\narcher allowed smoking.  but, in the first place, new york was a\\nmetropolis, and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \\\"not the\\nthing\\\" to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not \\\"the\\nthing\\\" played a part as important in newland archer's new york as the\\ninscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his\\nforefathers thousands of years ago.\\n\\nthe second reason for his delay was a personal one.  he had dawdled\\nover his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante, and thinking over\\na pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its\\nrealisation.  this was especially the case when the pleasure was a\\ndelicate one, as his pleasures mostly were; and on this occasion the\\nmoment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality\\nthat--well, if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima\\ndonna's stage-manager he could not have entered the academy at a more\\nsignificant moment than just as she was singing:  \\\"he loves me--he\\nloves me not--he loves me!--\\\" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals\\nwith notes as clear as dew.\\n\\nshe sang, of course, \\\"m'ama!\\\" and not \\\"he loves me,\\\" since an\\nunalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the\\ngerman text of french operas sung by swedish artists should be\\ntranslated into italian for the clearer understanding of\\nenglish-speaking audiences.  this seemed as natural to newland archer\\nas all the other conventions on which his life was moulded: such as the\\nduty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue\\nenamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a\\nflower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.\\n\\n\\\"m'ama ... non m'ama ...\\\" the prima donna sang, and \\\"m'ama!\\\", with a\\nfinal burst of love triumphant, as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to\\nher lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of\\nthe little brown faust-capoul, who was vainly trying, in a tight purple\\nvelvet doublet and plumed cap, to look as pure and true as his artless\\nvictim.\\n\\nnewland archer, leaning against the wall at the back of the club box,\\nturned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the\\nhouse.  directly facing him was the box of old mrs. manson mingott,\\nwhose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to\\nattend the opera, but who was always represented on fashionable nights\\nby some of the younger members of the family.  on this occasion, the\\nfront of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law, mrs. lovell\\nmingott, and her daughter, mrs. welland; and slightly withdrawn behind\\nthese brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically\\nfixed on the stagelovers.  as madame nilsson's \\\"m'ama!\\\" thrilled out\\nabove the silent house (the boxes always stopped talking during the\\ndaisy song) a warm pink mounted to the girl's cheek, mantled her brow\\nto the roots of her fair braids, and suffused the young slope of her\\nbreast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a\\nsingle gardenia.  she dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her knee, and newland archer saw her\\nwhite-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly.  he drew a breath of\\nsatisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage.\\n\\nno expense had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be\\nvery beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the\\nopera houses of paris and vienna.  the foreground, to the footlights,\\nwas covered with emerald green cloth.  in the middle distance\\nsymmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed\\nthe base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink\\nand red roses.  gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses,\\nand closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female\\nparishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath\\nthe rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch\\nflowered with a luxuriance prophetic of mr. luther burbank's far-off\\nprodigies.\\n\\nin the centre of this enchanted garden madame nilsson, in white\\ncashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue\\ngirdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her\\nmuslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to m. capoul's\\nimpassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his\\ndesigns whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the\\nground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from\\nthe right wing.\\n\\n\\\"the darling!\\\" thought newland archer, his glance flitting back to the\\nyoung girl with the lilies-of-the-valley.  \\\"she doesn't even guess what\\nit's all about.\\\" and he contemplated her absorbed young face with a\\nthrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation\\nwas mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity.  \\\"we'll\\nread faust together ... by the italian lakes ...\\\" he thought, somewhat\\nhazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the\\nmasterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to\\nreveal to his bride.  it was only that afternoon that may welland had\\nlet him guess that she \\\"cared\\\" (new york's consecrated phrase of maiden\\navowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement\\nring, the betrothal kiss and the march from lohengrin, pictured her at\\nhis side in some scene of old european witchery.\\n\\nhe did not in the least wish the future mrs. newland archer to be a\\nsimpleton.  he meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to\\ndevelop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own\\nwith the most popular married women of the \\\"younger set,\\\" in which it\\nwas the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully\\ndiscouraging it.  if he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he\\nsometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife\\nshould be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady\\nwhose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years;\\nwithout, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred\\nthat unhappy being's life, and had disarranged his own plans for a\\nwhole winter.\\n\\nhow this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain\\nitself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but\\nhe was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it\\nwas that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated,\\nbutton-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club\\nbox, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their\\nopera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product\\nof the system.  in matters intellectual and artistic newland archer\\nfelt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old\\nnew york gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even\\nseen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number.\\nsingly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they\\nrepresented \\\"new york,\\\" and the habit of masculine solidarity made him\\naccept their doctrine on all the issues called moral.  he instinctively\\nfelt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad\\nform--to strike out for himself.\\n\\n\\\"well--upon my soul!\\\" exclaimed lawrence lefferts, turning his\\nopera-glass abruptly away from the stage.  lawrence lefferts was, on\\nthe whole, the foremost authority on \\\"form\\\" in new york.  he had\\nprobably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this\\nintricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not account\\nfor his complete and easy competence.  one had only to look at him,\\nfrom the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair\\nmoustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean\\nand elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of \\\"form\\\" must be\\ncongenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so\\ncarelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace.  as a\\nyoung admirer had once said of him:  \\\"if anybody can tell a fellow just\\nwhen to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to, it's\\nlarry lefferts.\\\"  and on the question of pumps versus patent-leather\\n\\\"oxfords\\\" his authority had never been disputed.\\n\\n\\\"my god!\\\" he said; and silently handed his glass to old sillerton\\njackson.\\n\\nnewland archer, following lefferts's glance, saw with surprise that his\\nexclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old\\nmrs. mingott's box.  it was that of a slim young woman, a little less\\ntall than may welland, with brown hair growing in close curls about her\\ntemples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds.  the suggestion\\nof this headdress, which gave her what was then called a \\\"josephine\\nlook,\\\" was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather\\ntheatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large\\nold-fashioned clasp.  the wearer of this unusual dress, who seemed\\nquite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment in\\nthe centre of the box, discussing with mrs. welland the propriety of\\ntaking the latter's place in the front right-hand corner; then she\\nyielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with mrs.\\nwelland's sister-in-law, mrs. lovell mingott, who was installed in the\\nopposite corner.\\n\\nmr. sillerton jackson had returned the opera-glass to lawrence\\nlefferts.  the whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hear\\nwhat the old man had to say; for old mr. jackson was as great an\\nauthority on \\\"family\\\" as lawrence lefferts was on \\\"form.\\\"  he knew all\\nthe ramifications of new york's cousinships; and could not only\\nelucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between\\nthe mingotts (through the thorleys) with the dallases of south\\ncarolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch of\\nphiladelphia thorleys to the albany chiverses (on no account to be\\nconfused with the manson chiverses of university place), but could also\\nenumerate the leading characteristics of each family: as, for instance,\\nthe fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of leffertses (the long\\nisland ones); or the fatal tendency of the rushworths to make foolish\\nmatches; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the\\nalbany chiverses, with whom their new york cousins had always refused\\nto intermarry--with the disastrous exception of poor medora manson,\\nwho, as everybody knew ... but then her mother was a rushworth.\\n\\nin addition to this forest of family trees, mr. sillerton jackson\\ncarried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch of\\nsilver hair, a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had\\nsmouldered under the unruffled surface of new york society within the\\nlast fifty years.  so far indeed did his information extend, and so\\nacutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the only\\nman who could have told you who julius beaufort, the banker, really\\nwas, and what had become of handsome bob spicer, old mrs. manson\\nmingott's father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sum\\nof trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very day\\nthat a beautiful spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged\\naudiences in the old opera-house on the battery had taken ship for\\ncuba.  but these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in mr.\\njackson's breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his\\nrepeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his\\nreputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out\\nwhat he wanted to know.\\n\\nthe club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while mr. sillerton\\njackson handed back lawrence lefferts's opera-glass.  for a moment he\\nsilently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes\\noverhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful\\ntwist, and said simply:  \\\"i didn't think the mingotts would have tried\\nit on.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnewland archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a\\nstrange state of embarrassment.\\n\\nit was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided\\nattention of masculine new york should be that in which his betrothed\\nwas seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not\\nidentify the lady in the empire dress, nor imagine why her presence\\ncreated such excitement among the initiated.  then light dawned on him,\\nand with it came a momentary rush of indignation.  no, indeed; no one\\nwould have thought the mingotts would have tried it on!\\n\\nbut they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind\\nhim left no doubt in archer's mind that the young woman was may\\nwelland's cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as \\\"poor\\nellen olenska.\\\"  archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from europe\\na day or two previously; he had even heard from miss welland (not\\ndisapprovingly) that she had been to see poor ellen, who was staying\\nwith old mrs. mingott.  archer entirely approved of family solidarity,\\nand one of the qualities he most admired in the mingotts was their\\nresolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock\\nhad produced.  there was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man's\\nheart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by\\nfalse prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but\\nto receive countess olenska in the family circle was a different thing\\nfrom producing her in public, at the opera of all places, and in the\\nvery box with the young girl whose engagement to him, newland archer,\\nwas to be announced within a few weeks.  no, he felt as old sillerton\\njackson felt; he did not think the mingotts would have tried it on!\\n\\nhe knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within fifth avenue's\\nlimits) that old mrs. manson mingott, the matriarch of the line, would\\ndare.  he had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in\\nspite of having been only catherine spicer of staten island, with a\\nfather mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough\\nto make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the\\nwealthy mingott line, married two of her daughters to \\\"foreigners\\\" (an\\nitalian marquis and an english banker), and put the crowning touch to\\nher audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone\\n(when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in\\nthe afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the central park.\\n\\nold mrs. mingott's foreign daughters had become a legend.  they never\\ncame back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons\\nof active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her\\nhabit, had philosophically remained at home.  but the cream-coloured\\nhouse (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the parisian\\naristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she\\nthroned in it, among pre-revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the\\ntuileries of louis napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as\\nplacidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above\\nthirty-fourth street, or in having french windows that opened like\\ndoors instead of sashes that pushed up.\\n\\nevery one (including mr. sillerton jackson) was agreed that old\\ncatherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of new york,\\njustified every success, and excused a certain number of failings.\\nunkind people said that, like her imperial namesake, she had won her\\nway to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of\\nhaughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency\\nand dignity of her private life.  mr. manson mingott had died when she\\nwas only twenty-eight, and had \\\"tied up\\\" the money with an additional\\ncaution born of the general distrust of the spicers; but his bold young\\nwidow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society,\\nmarried her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable\\ncircles, hobnobbed with dukes and ambassadors, associated familiarly\\nwith papists, entertained opera singers, and was the intimate friend of\\nmme. taglioni; and all the while (as sillerton jackson was the first to\\nproclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only\\nrespect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier\\ncatherine.\\n\\nmrs. manson mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husband's\\nfortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of\\nher early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when\\nshe bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it\\nshould be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the\\ntransient pleasures of the table.  therefore, for totally different\\nreasons, her food was as poor as mrs. archer's, and her wines did\\nnothing to redeem it.  her relatives considered that the penury of her\\ntable discredited the mingott name, which had always been associated\\nwith good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the\\n\\\"made dishes\\\" and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of\\nher son lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the\\nbest chef in new york) she used to say laughingly:  \\\"what's the use of\\ntwo good cooks in one family, now that i've married the girls and can't\\neat sauces?\\\"\\n\\nnewland archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his\\neyes toward the mingott box.  he saw that mrs. welland and her\\nsister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the\\nmingottian aplomb which old catherine had inculcated in all her tribe,\\nand that only may welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due\\nto the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of\\nthe situation.  as for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully\\nin her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing,\\nas she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than new york\\nwas accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for\\nwishing to pass unnoticed.\\n\\nfew things seemed to newland archer more awful than an offence against\\n\\\"taste,\\\" that far-off divinity of whom \\\"form\\\" was the mere visible\\nrepresentative and vicegerent.  madame olenska's pale and serious face\\nappealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy\\nsituation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from\\nher thin shoulders shocked and troubled him.  he hated to think of may\\nwelland's being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless\\nof the dictates of taste.\\n\\n\\\"after all,\\\" he heard one of the younger men begin behind him\\n(everybody talked through the mephistopheles-and-martha scenes), \\\"after\\nall, just what happened?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"he's an awful brute, isn't he?\\\" continued the young enquirer, a candid\\nthorley, who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the lady's\\nchampion.\\n\\n\\\"the very worst; i knew him at nice,\\\" said lawrence lefferts with\\nauthority.  \\\"a half-paralysed white sneering fellow--rather handsome\\nhead, but eyes with a lot of lashes.  well, i'll tell you the sort:\\nwhen he wasn't with women he was collecting china.  paying any price\\nfor both, i understand.\\\"\\n\\nthere was a general laugh, and the young champion said:  \\\"well,\\nthen----?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, then; she bolted with his secretary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, i see.\\\"  the champion's face fell.\\n\\n\\\"it didn't last long, though: i heard of her a few months later living\\nalone in venice.  i believe lovell mingott went out to get her.  he\\nsaid she was desperately unhappy.  that's all right--but this parading\\nher at the opera's another thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"perhaps,\\\" young thorley hazarded, \\\"she's too unhappy to be left at\\nhome.\\\"\\n\\nthis was greeted with an irreverent laugh, and the youth blushed\\ndeeply, and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowing\\npeople called a \\\"double entendre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--it's queer to have brought miss welland, anyhow,\\\" some one said\\nin a low tone, with a side-glance at archer.\\n\\n\\\"oh, that's part of the campaign: granny's orders, no doubt,\\\" lefferts\\nlaughed.  \\\"when the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly.\\\"\\n\\nthe act was ending, and there was a general stir in the box.  suddenly\\nnewland archer felt himself impelled to decisive action.  the desire to\\nbe the first man to enter mrs. mingott's box, to proclaim to the\\nwaiting world his engagement to may welland, and to see her through\\nwhatever difficulties her cousin's anomalous situation might involve\\nher in; this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples and\\nhesitations, and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to the\\nfarther side of the house.\\n\\nas he entered the box his eyes met miss welland's, and he saw that she\\nhad instantly understood his motive, though the family dignity which\\nboth considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so.\\nthe persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications\\nand pale delicacies, and the fact that he and she understood each other\\nwithout a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than any\\nexplanation would have done.  her eyes said:  \\\"you see why mamma\\nbrought me,\\\" and his answered:  \\\"i would not for the world have had you\\nstay away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you know my niece countess olenska?\\\" mrs. welland enquired as she\\nshook hands with her future son-in-law.  archer bowed without extending\\nhis hand, as was the custom on being introduced to a lady; and ellen\\nolenska bent her head slightly, keeping her own pale-gloved hands\\nclasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers.  having greeted mrs. lovell\\nmingott, a large blonde lady in creaking satin, he sat down beside his\\nbetrothed, and said in a low tone:  \\\"i hope you've told madame olenska\\nthat we're engaged?  i want everybody to know--i want you to let me\\nannounce it this evening at the ball.\\\"\\n\\nmiss welland's face grew rosy as the dawn, and she looked at him with\\nradiant eyes.  \\\"if you can persuade mamma,\\\" she said; \\\"but why should\\nwe change what is already settled?\\\"  he made no answer but that which\\nhis eyes returned, and she added, still more confidently smiling:\\n\\\"tell my cousin yourself: i give you leave.  she says she used to play\\nwith you when you were children.\\\"\\n\\nshe made way for him by pushing back her chair, and promptly, and a\\nlittle ostentatiously, with the desire that the whole house should see\\nwhat he was doing, archer seated himself at the countess olenska's side.\\n\\n\\\"we did use to play together, didn't we?\\\" she asked, turning her grave\\neyes to his.  \\\"you were a horrid boy, and kissed me once behind a door;\\nbut it was your cousin vandie newland, who never looked at me, that i\\nwas in love with.\\\"  her glance swept the horse-shoe curve of boxes.\\n\\\"ah, how this brings it all back to me--i see everybody here in\\nknickerbockers and pantalettes,\\\" she said, with her trailing slightly\\nforeign accent, her eyes returning to his face.\\n\\nagreeable as their expression was, the young man was shocked that they\\nshould reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal before\\nwhich, at that very moment, her case was being tried.  nothing could be\\nin worse taste than misplaced flippancy; and he answered somewhat\\nstiffly:  \\\"yes, you have been away a very long time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, centuries and centuries; so long,\\\" she said, \\\"that i'm sure i'm\\ndead and buried, and this dear old place is heaven;\\\" which, for reasons\\nhe could not define, struck newland archer as an even more\\ndisrespectful way of describing new york society.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit invariably happened in the same way.\\n\\nmrs. julius beaufort, on the night of her annual ball, never failed to\\nappear at the opera; indeed, she always gave her ball on an opera night\\nin order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares, and\\nher possession of a staff of servants competent to organise every\\ndetail of the entertainment in her absence.\\n\\nthe beauforts' house was one of the few in new york that possessed a\\nball-room (it antedated even mrs. manson mingott's and the headly\\nchiverses'); and at a time when it was beginning to be thought\\n\\\"provincial\\\" to put a \\\"crash\\\" over the drawing-room floor and move the\\nfurniture upstairs, the possession of a ball-room that was used for no\\nother purpose, and left for three-hundred-and-sixty-four days of the\\nyear to shuttered darkness, with its gilt chairs stacked in a corner\\nand its chandelier in a bag; this undoubted superiority was felt to\\ncompensate for whatever was regrettable in the beaufort past.\\n\\nmrs. archer, who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms,\\nhad once said:  \\\"we all have our pet common people--\\\" and though the\\nphrase was a daring one, its truth was secretly admitted in many an\\nexclusive bosom.  but the beauforts were not exactly common; some\\npeople said they were even worse.  mrs. beaufort belonged indeed to one\\nof america's most honoured families; she had been the lovely regina\\ndallas (of the south carolina branch), a penniless beauty introduced to\\nnew york society by her cousin, the imprudent medora manson, who was\\nalways doing the wrong thing from the right motive.  when one was\\nrelated to the mansons and the rushworths one had a \\\"droit de cite\\\" (as\\nmr. sillerton jackson, who had frequented the tuileries, called it) in\\nnew york society; but did one not forfeit it in marrying julius\\nbeaufort?\\n\\nthe question was: who was beaufort?  he passed for an englishman, was\\nagreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty.  he had come\\nto america with letters of recommendation from old mrs. manson\\nmingott's english son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself\\nan important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were\\ndissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and\\nwhen medora manson announced her cousin's engagement to him it was felt\\nto be one more act of folly in poor medora's long record of imprudences.\\n\\nbut folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two\\nyears after young mrs. beaufort's marriage it was admitted that she had\\nthe most distinguished house in new york.  no one knew exactly how the\\nmiracle was accomplished.  she was indolent, passive, the caustic even\\ncalled her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing\\nyounger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in mr.\\nbeaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there\\nwithout lifting her jewelled little finger.  the knowing people said it\\nwas beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new\\ndishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the\\ndinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the\\nafter-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her\\nfriends.  if he did, these domestic activities were privately\\nperformed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless\\nand hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the\\ndetachment of an invited guest, and saying:  \\\"my wife's gloxinias are a\\nmarvel, aren't they?  i believe she gets them out from kew.\\\"\\n\\nmr. beaufort's secret, people were agreed, was the way he carried\\nthings off.  it was all very well to whisper that he had been \\\"helped\\\"\\nto leave england by the international banking-house in which he had\\nbeen employed; he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest--though\\nnew york's business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral\\nstandard--he carried everything before him, and all new york into his\\ndrawing-rooms, and for over twenty years now people had said they were\\n\\\"going to the beauforts'\\\" with the same tone of security as if they had\\nsaid they were going to mrs. manson mingott's, and with the added\\nsatisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas-back ducks and\\nvintage wines, instead of tepid veuve clicquot without a year and\\nwarmed-up croquettes from philadelphia.\\n\\nmrs. beaufort, then, had as usual appeared in her box just before the\\njewel song; and when, again as usual, she rose at the end of the third\\nact, drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders, and disappeared,\\nnew york knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin.\\n\\nthe beaufort house was one that new yorkers were proud to show to\\nforeigners, especially on the night of the annual ball.  the beauforts\\nhad been among the first people in new york to own their own red velvet\\ncarpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen, under\\ntheir own awning, instead of hiring it with the supper and the\\nball-room chairs.  they had also inaugurated the custom of letting the\\nladies take their cloaks off in the hall, instead of shuffling up to\\nthe hostess's bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the\\ngas-burner; beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all\\nhis wife's friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly\\ncoiffees when they left home.\\n\\nthen the house had been boldly planned with a ball-room, so that,\\ninstead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it (as at the\\nchiverses') one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed\\ndrawing-rooms (the sea-green, the crimson and the bouton d'or), seeing\\nfrom afar the many-candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry,\\nand beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and\\ntree-ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold\\nbamboo.\\n\\nnewland archer, as became a young man of his position, strolled in\\nsomewhat late.  he had left his overcoat with the silk-stockinged\\nfootmen (the stockings were one of beaufort's few fatuities), had\\ndawdled a while in the library hung with spanish leather and furnished\\nwith buhl and malachite, where a few men were chatting and putting on\\ntheir dancing-gloves, and had finally joined the line of guests whom\\nmrs. beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\narcher was distinctly nervous.  he had not gone back to his club after\\nthe opera (as the young bloods usually did), but, the night being fine,\\nhad walked for some distance up fifth avenue before turning back in the\\ndirection of the beauforts' house.  he was definitely afraid that the\\nmingotts might be going too far; that, in fact, they might have granny\\nmingott's orders to bring the countess olenska to the ball.\\n\\nfrom the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that\\nwould be; and, though he was more than ever determined to \\\"see the\\nthing through,\\\" he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his\\nbetrothed's cousin than before their brief talk at the opera.\\n\\nwandering on to the bouton d'or drawing-room (where beaufort had had\\nthe audacity to hang \\\"love victorious,\\\" the much-discussed nude of\\nbouguereau) archer found mrs. welland and her daughter standing near\\nthe ball-room door.  couples were already gliding over the floor\\nbeyond: the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts, on\\ngirlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms, on the dashing aigrettes\\nand ornaments of the young married women's coiffures, and on the\\nglitter of highly glazed shirt-fronts and fresh glace gloves.\\n\\nmiss welland, evidently about to join the dancers, hung on the\\nthreshold, her lilies-of-the-valley in her hand (she carried no other\\nbouquet), her face a little pale, her eyes burning with a candid\\nexcitement.  a group of young men and girls were gathered about her,\\nand there was much hand-clasping, laughing and pleasantry on which mrs.\\nwelland, standing slightly apart, shed the beam of a qualified\\napproval.  it was evident that miss welland was in the act of\\nannouncing her engagement, while her mother affected the air of\\nparental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion.\\n\\narcher paused a moment.  it was at his express wish that the\\nannouncement had been made, and yet it was not thus that he would have\\nwished to have his happiness known.  to proclaim it in the heat and\\nnoise of a crowded ball-room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy\\nwhich should belong to things nearest the heart.  his joy was so deep\\nthat this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched; but he\\nwould have liked to keep the surface pure too.  it was something of a\\nsatisfaction to find that may welland shared this feeling.  her eyes\\nfled to his beseechingly, and their look said:  \\\"remember, we're doing\\nthis because it's right.\\\"\\n\\nno appeal could have found a more immediate response in archer's\\nbreast; but he wished that the necessity of their action had been\\nrepresented by some ideal reason, and not simply by poor ellen olenska.\\nthe group about miss welland made way for him with significant smiles,\\nand after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed\\ninto the middle of the ball-room floor and put his arm about her waist.\\n\\n\\\"now we shan't have to talk,\\\" he said, smiling into her candid eyes, as\\nthey floated away on the soft waves of the blue danube.\\n\\nshe made no answer.  her lips trembled into a smile, but the eyes\\nremained distant and serious, as if bent on some ineffable vision.\\n\\\"dear,\\\" archer whispered, pressing her to him: it was borne in on him\\nthat the first hours of being engaged, even if spent in a ball-room,\\nhad in them something grave and sacramental.  what a new life it was\\ngoing to be, with this whiteness, radiance, goodness at one's side!\\n\\nthe dance over, the two, as became an affianced couple, wandered into\\nthe conservatory; and sitting behind a tall screen of tree-ferns and\\ncamellias newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips.\\n\\n\\\"you see i did as you asked me to,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"yes: i couldn't wait,\\\" he answered smiling.  after a moment he added:\\n\\\"only i wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes, i know.\\\"  she met his glance comprehendingly.  \\\"but after\\nall--even here we're alone together, aren't we?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, dearest--always!\\\" archer cried.\\n\\nevidently she was always going to understand; she was always going to\\nsay the right thing.  the discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow,\\nand he went on gaily:  \\\"the worst of it is that i want to kiss you and\\ni can't.\\\"  as he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory,\\nassured himself of their momentary privacy, and catching her to him\\nlaid a fugitive pressure on her lips.  to counteract the audacity of\\nthis proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of\\nthe conservatory, and sitting down beside her broke a\\nlily-of-the-valley from her bouquet.  she sat silent, and the world lay\\nlike a sunlit valley at their feet.\\n\\n\\\"did you tell my cousin ellen?\\\" she asked presently, as if she spoke\\nthrough a dream.\\n\\nhe roused himself, and remembered that he had not done so.  some\\ninvincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign\\nwoman had checked the words on his lips.\\n\\n\\\"no--i hadn't the chance after all,\\\" he said, fibbing hastily.\\n\\n\\\"ah.\\\"  she looked disappointed, but gently resolved on gaining her\\npoint.  \\\"you must, then, for i didn't either; and i shouldn't like her\\nto think--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"of course not.  but aren't you, after all, the person to do it?\\\"\\n\\nshe pondered on this.  \\\"if i'd done it at the right time, yes: but now\\nthat there's been a delay i think you must explain that i'd asked you\\nto tell her at the opera, before our speaking about it to everybody\\nhere.  otherwise she might think i had forgotten her.  you see, she's\\none of the family, and she's been away so long that she's\\nrather--sensitive.\\\"\\n\\narcher looked at her glowingly.  \\\"dear and great angel!  of course i'll\\ntell her.\\\"  he glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded\\nball-room.  \\\"but i haven't seen her yet.  has she come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no; at the last minute she decided not to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"at the last minute?\\\" he echoed, betraying his surprise that she should\\never have considered the alternative possible.\\n\\n\\\"yes.  she's awfully fond of dancing,\\\" the young girl answered simply.\\n\\\"but suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn't smart enough\\nfor a ball, though we thought it so lovely; and so my aunt had to take\\nher home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, well--\\\" said archer with happy indifference.  nothing about his\\nbetrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to\\nits utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the \\\"unpleasant\\\" in which they\\nhad both been brought up.\\n\\n\\\"she knows as well as i do,\\\" he reflected, \\\"the real reason of her\\ncousin's staying away; but i shall never let her see by the least sign\\nthat i am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor ellen\\nolenska's reputation.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits\\nwere exchanged.  the new york ritual was precise and inflexible in such\\nmatters; and in conformity with it newland archer first went with his\\nmother and sister to call on mrs. welland, after which he and mrs.\\nwelland and may drove out to old mrs. manson mingott's to receive that\\nvenerable ancestress's blessing.\\n\\na visit to mrs. manson mingott was always an amusing episode to the\\nyoung man.  the house in itself was already an historic document,\\nthough not, of course, as venerable as certain other old family houses\\nin university place and lower fifth avenue.  those were of the purest\\n1830, with a grim harmony of cabbage-rose-garlanded carpets, rosewood\\nconsoles, round-arched fire-places with black marble mantels, and\\nimmense glazed book-cases of mahogany; whereas old mrs. mingott, who\\nhad built her house later, had bodily cast out the massive furniture of\\nher prime, and mingled with the mingott heirlooms the frivolous\\nupholstery of the second empire.  it was her habit to sit in a window\\nof her sitting-room on the ground floor, as if watching calmly for life\\nand fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors.  she seemed in no\\nhurry to have them come, for her patience was equalled by her\\nconfidence.  she was sure that presently the hoardings, the quarries,\\nthe one-story saloons, the wooden green-houses in ragged gardens, and\\nthe rocks from which goats surveyed the scene, would vanish before the\\nadvance of residences as stately as her own--perhaps (for she was an\\nimpartial woman) even statelier; and that the cobble-stones over which\\nthe old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth\\nasphalt, such as people reported having seen in paris.  meanwhile, as\\nevery one she cared to see came to her (and she could fill her rooms as\\neasily as the beauforts, and without adding a single item to the menu\\nof her suppers), she did not suffer from her geographic isolation.\\n\\nthe immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle\\nlife like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump\\nactive little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into something\\nas vast and august as a natural phenomenon.  she had accepted this\\nsubmergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in\\nextreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost\\nunwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the centre of which\\nthe traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation.  a\\nflight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a\\nstill-snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a\\nminiature portrait of the late mr. mingott; and around and below, wave\\nafter wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious\\narmchair, with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of\\nthe billows.\\n\\nthe burden of mrs. manson mingott's flesh had long since made it\\nimpossible for her to go up and down stairs, and with characteristic\\nindependence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established\\nherself (in flagrant violation of all the new york proprieties) on the\\nground floor of her house; so that, as you sat in her sitting-room\\nwindow with her, you caught (through a door that was always open, and a\\nlooped-back yellow damask portiere) the unexpected vista of a bedroom\\nwith a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa, and a toilet-table with\\nfrivolous lace flounces and a gilt-framed mirror.\\n\\nher visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this\\narrangement, which recalled scenes in french fiction, and architectural\\nincentives to immorality such as the simple american had never dreamed\\nof.  that was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies,\\nin apartments with all the rooms on one floor, and all the indecent\\npropinquities that their novels described.  it amused newland archer\\n(who had secretly situated the love-scenes of \\\"monsieur de camors\\\" in\\nmrs. mingott's bedroom) to picture her blameless life led in the\\nstage-setting of adultery; but he said to himself, with considerable\\nadmiration, that if a lover had been what she wanted, the intrepid\\nwoman would have had him too.\\n\\nto the general relief the countess olenska was not present in her\\ngrandmother's drawing-room during the visit of the betrothed couple.\\nmrs. mingott said she had gone out; which, on a day of such glaring\\nsunlight, and at the \\\"shopping hour,\\\" seemed in itself an indelicate\\nthing for a compromised woman to do.  but at any rate it spared them\\nthe embarrassment of her presence, and the faint shadow that her\\nunhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future.  the visit\\nwent off successfully, as was to have been expected.  old mrs. mingott\\nwas delighted with the engagement, which, being long foreseen by\\nwatchful relatives, had been carefully passed upon in family council;\\nand the engagement ring, a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws,\\nmet with her unqualified admiration.\\n\\n\\\"it's the new setting: of course it shows the stone beautifully, but it\\nlooks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes,\\\" mrs. welland had explained,\\nwith a conciliatory side-glance at her future son-in-law.\\n\\n\\\"old-fashioned eyes?  i hope you don't mean mine, my dear?  i like all\\nthe novelties,\\\" said the ancestress, lifting the stone to her small\\nbright orbs, which no glasses had ever disfigured.  \\\"very handsome,\\\"\\nshe added, returning the jewel; \\\"very liberal.  in my time a cameo set\\nin pearls was thought sufficient.  but it's the hand that sets off the\\nring, isn't it, my dear mr. archer?\\\" and she waved one of her tiny\\nhands, with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the\\nwrist like ivory bracelets.  \\\"mine was modelled in rome by the great\\nferrigiani.  you should have may's done: no doubt he'll have it done,\\nmy child.  her hand is large--it's these modern sports that spread the\\njoints--but the skin is white.--and when's the wedding to be?\\\" she\\nbroke off, fixing her eyes on archer's face.\\n\\n\\\"oh--\\\" mrs. welland murmured, while the young man, smiling at his\\nbetrothed, replied:  \\\"as soon as ever it can, if only you'll back me\\nup, mrs. mingott.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"we must give them time to get to know each other a little better,\\nmamma,\\\" mrs. welland interposed, with the proper affectation of\\nreluctance; to which the ancestress rejoined:  \\\"know each other?\\nfiddlesticks!  everybody in new york has always known everybody.  let\\nthe young man have his way, my dear; don't wait till the bubble's off\\nthe wine.  marry them before lent; i may catch pneumonia any winter\\nnow, and i want to give the wedding-breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nthese successive statements were received with the proper expressions\\nof amusement, incredulity and gratitude; and the visit was breaking up\\nin a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the countess\\nolenska, who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected\\nfigure of julius beaufort.\\n\\nthere was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies, and mrs.\\nmingott held out ferrigiani's model to the banker.  \\\"ha!  beaufort,\\nthis is a rare favour!\\\" (she had an odd foreign way of addressing men\\nby their surnames.)\\n\\n\\\"thanks.  i wish it might happen oftener,\\\" said the visitor in his easy\\narrogant way.  \\\"i'm generally so tied down; but i met the countess\\nellen in madison square, and she was good enough to let me walk home\\nwith her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--i hope the house will be gayer, now that ellen's here!\\\" cried mrs.\\nmingott with a glorious effrontery.  \\\"sit down--sit down, beaufort:\\npush up the yellow armchair; now i've got you i want a good gossip.  i\\nhear your ball was magnificent; and i understand you invited mrs.\\nlemuel struthers?  well--i've a curiosity to see the woman myself.\\\"\\n\\nshe had forgotten her relatives, who were drifting out into the hall\\nunder ellen olenska's guidance.  old mrs. mingott had always professed\\na great admiration for julius beaufort, and there was a kind of kinship\\nin their cool domineering way and their short-cuts through the\\nconventions.  now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the\\nbeauforts to invite (for the first time) mrs. lemuel struthers, the\\nwidow of struthers's shoe-polish, who had returned the previous year\\nfrom a long initiatory sojourn in europe to lay siege to the tight\\nlittle citadel of new york.  \\\"of course if you and regina invite her\\nthe thing is settled.  well, we need new blood and new money--and i\\nhear she's still very good-looking,\\\" the carnivorous old lady declared.\\n\\nin the hall, while mrs. welland and may drew on their furs, archer saw\\nthat the countess olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning\\nsmile.\\n\\n\\\"of course you know already--about may and me,\\\" he said, answering her\\nlook with a shy laugh.  \\\"she scolded me for not giving you the news\\nlast night at the opera: i had her orders to tell you that we were\\nengaged--but i couldn't, in that crowd.\\\"\\n\\nthe smile passed from countess olenska's eyes to her lips: she looked\\nyounger, more like the bold brown ellen mingott of his boyhood.  \\\"of\\ncourse i know; yes.  and i'm so glad.  but one doesn't tell such things\\nfirst in a crowd.\\\"  the ladies were on the threshold and she held out\\nher hand.\\n\\n\\\"good-bye; come and see me some day,\\\" she said, still looking at archer.\\n\\nin the carriage, on the way down fifth avenue, they talked pointedly of\\nmrs. mingott, of her age, her spirit, and all her wonderful attributes.\\nno one alluded to ellen olenska; but archer knew that mrs. welland was\\nthinking:  \\\"it's a mistake for ellen to be seen, the very day after her\\narrival, parading up fifth avenue at the crowded hour with julius\\nbeaufort--\\\" and the young man himself mentally added:  \\\"and she ought\\nto know that a man who's just engaged doesn't spend his time calling on\\nmarried women.  but i daresay in the set she's lived in they do--they\\nnever do anything else.\\\" and, in spite of the cosmopolitan views on\\nwhich he prided himself, he thanked heaven that he was a new yorker,\\nand about to ally himself with one of his own kind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe next evening old mr. sillerton jackson came to dine with the\\narchers.\\n\\nmrs. archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked to\\nbe well-informed as to its doings.  her old friend mr. sillerton\\njackson applied to the investigation of his friends' affairs the\\npatience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and his\\nsister, miss sophy jackson, who lived with him, and was entertained by\\nall the people who could not secure her much-sought-after brother,\\nbrought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in\\nhis picture.\\n\\ntherefore, whenever anything happened that mrs. archer wanted to know\\nabout, she asked mr. jackson to dine; and as she honoured few people\\nwith her invitations, and as she and her daughter janey were an\\nexcellent audience, mr. jackson usually came himself instead of sending\\nhis sister.  if he could have dictated all the conditions, he would\\nhave chosen the evenings when newland was out; not because the young\\nman was uncongenial to him (the two got on capitally at their club) but\\nbecause the old anecdotist sometimes felt, on newland's part, a\\ntendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never\\nshowed.\\n\\nmr. jackson, if perfection had been attainable on earth, would also\\nhave asked that mrs. archer's food should be a little better.  but then\\nnew york, as far back as the mind of man could travel, had been divided\\ninto the two great fundamental groups of the mingotts and mansons and\\nall their clan, who cared about eating and clothes and money, and the\\narcher-newland-van-der-luyden tribe, who were devoted to travel,\\nhorticulture and the best fiction, and looked down on the grosser forms\\nof pleasure.\\n\\nyou couldn't have everything, after all.  if you dined with the lovell\\nmingotts you got canvas-back and terrapin and vintage wines; at adeline\\narcher's you could talk about alpine scenery and \\\"the marble faun\\\"; and\\nluckily the archer madeira had gone round the cape.  therefore when a\\nfriendly summons came from mrs. archer, mr. jackson, who was a true\\neclectic, would usually say to his sister:  \\\"i've been a little gouty\\nsince my last dinner at the lovell mingotts'--it will do me good to\\ndiet at adeline's.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer, who had long been a widow, lived with her son and daughter\\nin west twenty-eighth street.  an upper floor was dedicated to newland,\\nand the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below.  in\\nan unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in\\nwardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen,\\ncollected american revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to \\\"good\\nwords,\\\" and read ouida's novels for the sake of the italian atmosphere.\\n(they preferred those about peasant life, because of the descriptions\\nof scenery and the pleasanter sentiments, though in general they liked\\nnovels about people in society, whose motives and habits were more\\ncomprehensible, spoke severely of dickens, who \\\"had never drawn a\\ngentleman,\\\" and considered thackeray less at home in the great world\\nthan bulwer--who, however, was beginning to be thought old-fashioned.)\\nmrs. and miss archer were both great lovers of scenery.  it was what\\nthey principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad;\\nconsidering architecture and painting as subjects for men, and chiefly\\nfor learned persons who read ruskin.  mrs. archer had been born a\\nnewland, and mother and daughter, who were as like as sisters, were\\nboth, as people said, \\\"true newlands\\\"; tall, pale, and slightly\\nround-shouldered, with long noses, sweet smiles and a kind of drooping\\ndistinction like that in certain faded reynolds portraits.  their\\nphysical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint\\nhad not stretched mrs. archer's black brocade, while miss archer's\\nbrown and purple poplins hung, as the years went on, more and more\\nslackly on her virgin frame.\\n\\nmentally, the likeness between them, as newland was aware, was less\\ncomplete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear.  the\\nlong habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given\\nthem the same vocabulary, and the same habit of beginning their phrases\\n\\\"mother thinks\\\" or \\\"janey thinks,\\\" according as one or the other wished\\nto advance an opinion of her own; but in reality, while mrs. archer's\\nserene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar,\\njaney was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from\\nsprings of suppressed romance.\\n\\nmother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and\\nbrother; and archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and\\nuncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration, and by his\\nsecret satisfaction in it.  after all, he thought it a good thing for a\\nman to have his authority respected in his own house, even if his sense\\nof humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate.\\n\\non this occasion the young man was very sure that mr. jackson would\\nrather have had him dine out; but he had his own reasons for not doing\\nso.\\n\\nof course old jackson wanted to talk about ellen olenska, and of course\\nmrs. archer and janey wanted to hear what he had to tell.  all three\\nwould be slightly embarrassed by newland's presence, now that his\\nprospective relation to the mingott clan had been made known; and the\\nyoung man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn\\nthe difficulty.\\n\\nthey began, obliquely, by talking about mrs. lemuel struthers.\\n\\n\\\"it's a pity the beauforts asked her,\\\" mrs. archer said gently.  \\\"but\\nthen regina always does what he tells her; and beaufort--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"certain nuances escape beaufort,\\\" said mr. jackson, cautiously\\ninspecting the broiled shad, and wondering for the thousandth time why\\nmrs. archer's cook always burnt the roe to a cinder. (newland, who had\\nlong shared his wonder, could always detect it in the older man's\\nexpression of melancholy disapproval.)\\n\\n\\\"oh, necessarily; beaufort is a vulgar man,\\\" said mrs. archer.  \\\"my\\ngrandfather newland always used to say to my mother:  'whatever you do,\\ndon't let that fellow beaufort be introduced to the girls.'  but at\\nleast he's had the advantage of associating with gentlemen; in england\\ntoo, they say.  it's all very mysterious--\\\" she glanced at janey and\\npaused.  she and janey knew every fold of the beaufort mystery, but in\\npublic mrs. archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for\\nthe unmarried.\\n\\n\\\"but this mrs. struthers,\\\" mrs. archer continued; \\\"what did you say she\\nwas, sillerton?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"out of a mine: or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit.\\nthen with living wax-works, touring new england.  after the police\\nbroke that up, they say she lived--\\\"  mr. jackson in his turn glanced\\nat janey, whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids.\\nthere were still hiatuses for her in mrs. struthers's past.\\n\\n\\\"then,\\\" mr. jackson continued (and archer saw he was wondering why no\\none had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife),\\n\\\"then lemuel struthers came along.  they say his advertiser used the\\ngirl's head for the shoe-polish posters; her hair's intensely black,\\nyou know--the egyptian style.  anyhow, he--eventually--married her.\\\"\\nthere were volumes of innuendo in the way the \\\"eventually\\\" was spaced,\\nand each syllable given its due stress.\\n\\n\\\"oh, well--at the pass we've come to nowadays, it doesn't matter,\\\" said\\nmrs. archer indifferently.  the ladies were not really interested in\\nmrs. struthers just then; the subject of ellen olenska was too fresh\\nand too absorbing to them.  indeed, mrs. struthers's name had been\\nintroduced by mrs. archer only that she might presently be able to say:\\n\\\"and newland's new cousin--countess olenska?  was she at the ball too?\\\"\\n\\nthere was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son, and\\narcher knew it and had expected it.  even mrs. archer, who was seldom\\nunduly pleased with human events, had been altogether glad of her son's\\nengagement. (\\\"especially after that silly business with mrs.\\nrushworth,\\\" as she had remarked to janey, alluding to what had once\\nseemed to newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the\\nscar.)\\n\\nthere was no better match in new york than may welland, look at the\\nquestion from whatever point you chose.  of course such a marriage was\\nonly what newland was entitled to; but young men are so foolish and\\nincalculable--and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous--that it was\\nnothing short of a miracle to see one's only son safe past the siren\\nisle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity.\\n\\nall this mrs. archer felt, and her son knew she felt; but he knew also\\nthat she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his\\nengagement, or rather by its cause; and it was for that reason--because\\non the whole he was a tender and indulgent master--that he had stayed\\nat home that evening.  \\\"it's not that i don't approve of the mingotts'\\nesprit de corps; but why newland's engagement should be mixed up with\\nthat olenska woman's comings and goings i don't see,\\\" mrs. archer\\ngrumbled to janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect\\nsweetness.\\n\\nshe had behaved beautifully--and in beautiful behaviour she was\\nunsurpassed--during the call on mrs. welland; but newland knew (and his\\nbetrothed doubtless guessed) that all through the visit she and janey\\nwere nervously on the watch for madame olenska's possible intrusion;\\nand when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say\\nto her son:  \\\"i'm thankful that augusta welland received us alone.\\\"\\n\\nthese indications of inward disturbance moved archer the more that he\\ntoo felt that the mingotts had gone a little too far.  but, as it was\\nagainst all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever\\nallude to what was uppermost in their thoughts, he simply replied: \\\"oh,\\nwell, there's always a phase of family parties to be gone through when\\none gets engaged, and the sooner it's over the better.\\\"  at which his\\nmother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from\\nher grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes.\\n\\nher revenge, he felt--her lawful revenge--would be to \\\"draw\\\" mr.\\njackson that evening on the countess olenska; and, having publicly done\\nhis duty as a future member of the mingott clan, the young man had no\\nobjection to hearing the lady discussed in private--except that the\\nsubject was already beginning to bore him.\\n\\nmr. jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the\\nmournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own, and\\nhad rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff.  he\\nlooked baffled and hungry, and archer reflected that he would probably\\nfinish his meal on ellen olenska.\\n\\nmr. jackson leaned back in his chair, and glanced up at the candlelit\\narchers, newlands and van der luydens hanging in dark frames on the\\ndark walls.\\n\\n\\\"ah, how your grandfather archer loved a good dinner, my dear newland!\\\"\\nhe said, his eyes on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man in\\na stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-columned country-house\\nbehind him.  \\\"well--well--well ... i wonder what he would have said to\\nall these foreign marriages!\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and mr.\\njackson continued with deliberation: \\\"no, she was not at the ball.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--\\\" mrs. archer murmured, in a tone that implied:  \\\"she had that\\ndecency.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"perhaps the beauforts don't know her,\\\" janey suggested, with her\\nartless malice.\\n\\nmr. jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had been tasting invisible\\nmadeira.  \\\"mrs. beaufort may not--but beaufort certainly does, for she\\nwas seen walking up fifth avenue this afternoon with him by the whole\\nof new york.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"mercy--\\\" moaned mrs. archer, evidently perceiving the uselessness of\\ntrying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy.\\n\\n\\\"i wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon,\\\" janey\\nspeculated.  \\\"at the opera i know she had on dark blue velvet,\\nperfectly plain and flat--like a night-gown.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"janey!\\\" said her mother; and miss archer blushed and tried to look\\naudacious.\\n\\n\\\"it was, at any rate, in better taste not to go to the ball,\\\" mrs.\\narcher continued.\\n\\na spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin:  \\\"i don't think it was\\na question of taste with her.  may said she meant to go, and then\\ndecided that the dress in question wasn't smart enough.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference.  \\\"poor\\nellen,\\\" she simply remarked; adding compassionately:  \\\"we must always\\nbear in mind what an eccentric bringing-up medora manson gave her.\\nwhat can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at\\nher coming-out ball?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--don't i remember her in it!\\\" said mr. jackson; adding:  \\\"poor\\ngirl!\\\" in the tone of one who, while enjoying the memory, had fully\\nunderstood at the time what the sight portended.\\n\\n\\\"it's odd,\\\" janey remarked, \\\"that she should have kept such an ugly\\nname as ellen.  i should have changed it to elaine.\\\"  she glanced about\\nthe table to see the effect of this.\\n\\nher brother laughed.  \\\"why elaine?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i don't know; it sounds more--more polish,\\\" said janey, blushing.\\n\\n\\\"it sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,\\\"\\nsaid mrs. archer distantly.\\n\\n\\\"why not?\\\" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative.  \\\"why\\nshouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses?  why should she slink\\nabout as if it were she who had disgraced herself?  she's 'poor ellen'\\ncertainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;\\nbut i don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she were\\nthe culprit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"that, i suppose,\\\" said mr. jackson, speculatively, \\\"is the line the\\nmingotts mean to take.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man reddened.  \\\"i didn't have to wait for their cue, if\\nthat's what you mean, sir.  madame olenska has had an unhappy life:\\nthat doesn't make her an outcast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"there are rumours,\\\" began mr. jackson, glancing at janey.\\n\\n\\\"oh, i know: the secretary,\\\" the young man took him up.  \\\"nonsense,\\nmother; janey's grown-up.  they say, don't they,\\\" he went on, \\\"that the\\nsecretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept\\nher practically a prisoner?  well, what if he did?  i hope there isn't\\na man among us who wouldn't have done the same in such a case.\\\"\\n\\nmr. jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler:\\n\\\"perhaps ... that sauce ... just a little, after all--\\\"; then, having\\nhelped himself, he remarked: \\\"i'm told she's looking for a house.  she\\nmeans to live here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i hear she means to get a divorce,\\\" said janey boldly.\\n\\n\\\"i hope she will!\\\" archer exclaimed.\\n\\nthe word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil\\natmosphere of the archer dining-room.  mrs. archer raised her delicate\\neye-brows in the particular curve that signified:  \\\"the butler--\\\" and\\nthe young man, himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such\\nintimate matters in public, hastily branched off into an account of his\\nvisit to old mrs. mingott.\\n\\nafter dinner, according to immemorial custom, mrs. archer and janey\\ntrailed their long silk draperies up to the drawing-room, where, while\\nthe gentlemen smoked below stairs, they sat beside a carcel lamp with\\nan engraved globe, facing each other across a rosewood work-table with\\na green silk bag under it, and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry\\nband of field-flowers destined to adorn an \\\"occasional\\\" chair in the\\ndrawing-room of young mrs. newland archer.\\n\\nwhile this rite was in progress in the drawing-room, archer settled mr.\\njackson in an armchair near the fire in the gothic library and handed\\nhim a cigar.  mr. jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit\\nhis cigar with perfect confidence (it was newland who bought them), and\\nstretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said:  \\\"you say the\\nsecretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow?  well, he was\\nstill helping her a year later, then; for somebody met 'em living at\\nlausanne together.\\\"\\n\\nnewland reddened.  \\\"living together?  well, why not?  who had the right\\nto make her life over if she hadn't?  i'm sick of the hypocrisy that\\nwould bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with\\nharlots.\\\"\\n\\nhe stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar.  \\\"women ought to\\nbe free--as free as we are,\\\" he declared, making a discovery of which\\nhe was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.\\n\\nmr. sillerton jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted\\na sardonic whistle.\\n\\n\\\"well,\\\" he said after a pause, \\\"apparently count olenski takes your\\nview; for i never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife\\nback.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat evening, after mr. jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies\\nhad retired to their chintz-curtained bedroom, newland archer mounted\\nthoughtfully to his own study.  a vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the\\nfire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows\\nof books, its bronze and steel statuettes of \\\"the fencers\\\" on the\\nmantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked\\nsingularly home-like and welcoming.\\n\\nas he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a\\nlarge photograph of may welland, which the young girl had given him in\\nthe first days of their romance, and which had now displaced all the\\nother portraits on the table.  with a new sense of awe he looked at the\\nfrank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young\\ncreature whose soul's custodian he was to be.  that terrifying product\\nof the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who\\nknew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like a\\nstranger through may welland's familiar features; and once more it was\\nborne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been\\ntaught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas.\\n\\nthe case of the countess olenska had stirred up old settled convictions\\nand set them drifting dangerously through his mind.  his own\\nexclamation:  \\\"women should be free--as free as we are,\\\" struck to the\\nroot of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as\\nnon-existent.  \\\"nice\\\" women, however wronged, would never claim the\\nkind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were\\ntherefore--in the heat of argument--the more chivalrously ready to\\nconcede it to them.  such verbal generosities were in fact only a\\nhumbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things\\ntogether and bound people down to the old pattern.  but here he was\\npledged to defend, on the part of his betrothed's cousin, conduct that,\\non his own wife's part, would justify him in calling down on her all\\nthe thunders of church and state.  of course the dilemma was purely\\nhypothetical; since he wasn't a blackguard polish nobleman, it was\\nabsurd to speculate what his wife's rights would be if he were.  but\\nnewland archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and\\nmay's, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable.\\nwhat could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty,\\nas a \\\"decent\\\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a\\nmarriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?  what if, for some one\\nof the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them, they should\\ntire of each other, misunderstand or irritate each other?  he reviewed\\nhis friends' marriages--the supposedly happy ones--and saw none that\\nanswered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which\\nhe pictured as his permanent relation with may welland.  he perceived\\nthat such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the\\nversatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully\\ntrained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his\\nmarriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a\\ndull association of material and social interests held together by\\nignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.  lawrence\\nlefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely\\nrealised this enviable ideal.  as became the high-priest of form, he\\nhad formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that, in the\\nmost conspicuous moments of his frequent love-affairs with other men's\\nwives, she went about in smiling unconsciousness, saying that \\\"lawrence\\nwas so frightfully strict\\\"; and had been known to blush indignantly,\\nand avert her gaze, when some one alluded in her presence to the fact\\nthat julius beaufort (as became a \\\"foreigner\\\" of doubtful origin) had\\nwhat was known in new york as \\\"another establishment.\\\"\\n\\narcher tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite\\nsuch an ass as larry lefferts, nor may such a simpleton as poor\\ngertrude; but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not\\nof standards.  in reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic\\nworld, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but\\nonly represented by a set of arbitrary signs; as when mrs. welland, who\\nknew exactly why archer had pressed her to announce her daughter's\\nengagement at the beaufort ball (and had indeed expected him to do no\\nless), yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance, and the air of having\\nhad her hand forced, quite as, in the books on primitive man that\\npeople of advanced culture were beginning to read, the savage bride is\\ndragged with shrieks from her parents' tent.\\n\\nthe result, of course, was that the young girl who was the centre of\\nthis elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable\\nfor her very frankness and assurance.  she was frank, poor darling,\\nbecause she had nothing to conceal, assured because she knew of nothing\\nto be on her guard against; and with no better preparation than this,\\nshe was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called \\\"the\\nfacts of life.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man was sincerely but placidly in love.  he delighted in the\\nradiant good looks of his betrothed, in her health, her horsemanship,\\nher grace and quickness at games, and the shy interest in books and\\nideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance.  (she had\\nadvanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the idyls of the king,\\nbut not to feel the beauty of ulysses and the lotus eaters.) she was\\nstraightforward, loyal and brave; she had a sense of humour (chiefly\\nproved by her laughing at his jokes); and he suspected, in the depths\\nof her innocently-gazing soul, a glow of feeling that it would be a joy\\nto waken.  but when he had gone the brief round of her he returned\\ndiscouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were\\nonly an artificial product.  untrained human nature was not frank and\\ninnocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive\\nguile.  and he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious\\npurity, so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts\\nand grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to\\nbe what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he might\\nexercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow.\\n\\nthere was a certain triteness in these reflections: they were those\\nhabitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day.  but they\\nwere generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and self-abasement\\nof which newland archer felt no trace.  he could not deplore (as\\nthackeray's heroes so often exasperated him by doing) that he had not a\\nblank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she\\nwas to give to him.  he could not get away from the fact that if he had\\nbeen brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find\\ntheir way about than the babes in the wood; nor could he, for all his\\nanxious cogitations, see any honest reason (any, that is, unconnected\\nwith his own momentary pleasure, and the passion of masculine vanity)\\nwhy his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of\\nexperience as himself.\\n\\nsuch questions, at such an hour, were bound to drift through his mind;\\nbut he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision\\nwere due to the inopportune arrival of the countess olenska.  here he\\nwas, at the very moment of his betrothal--a moment for pure thoughts\\nand cloudless hopes--pitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised\\nall the special problems he would have preferred to let lie.  \\\"hang\\nellen olenska!\\\" he grumbled, as he covered his fire and began to\\nundress.  he could not really see why her fate should have the least\\nbearing on his; yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to\\nmeasure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced\\nupon him.\\n\\n\\na few days later the bolt fell.\\n\\nthe lovell mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as \\\"a formal\\ndinner\\\" (that is, three extra footmen, two dishes for each course, and\\na roman punch in the middle), and had headed their invitations with the\\nwords \\\"to meet the countess olenska,\\\" in accordance with the hospitable\\namerican fashion, which treats strangers as if they were royalties, or\\nat least as their ambassadors.\\n\\nthe guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in\\nwhich the initiated recognised the firm hand of catherine the great.\\nassociated with such immemorial standbys as the selfridge merrys, who\\nwere asked everywhere because they always had been, the beauforts, on\\nwhom there was a claim of relationship, and mr. sillerton jackson and\\nhis sister sophy (who went wherever her brother told her to), were some\\nof the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant\\n\\\"young married\\\" set; the lawrence leffertses, mrs. lefferts rushworth\\n(the lovely widow), the harry thorleys, the reggie chiverses and young\\nmorris dagonet and his wife (who was a van der luyden).  the company\\nindeed was perfectly assorted, since all the members belonged to the\\nlittle inner group of people who, during the long new york season,\\ndisported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently\\nundiminished zest.\\n\\nforty-eight hours later the unbelievable had happened; every one had\\nrefused the mingotts' invitation except the beauforts and old mr.\\njackson and his sister.  the intended slight was emphasised by the fact\\nthat even the reggie chiverses, who were of the mingott clan, were\\namong those inflicting it; and by the uniform wording of the notes, in\\nall of which the writers \\\"regretted that they were unable to accept,\\\"\\nwithout the mitigating plea of a \\\"previous engagement\\\" that ordinary\\ncourtesy prescribed.\\n\\nnew york society was, in those days, far too small, and too scant in\\nits resources, for every one in it (including livery-stable-keepers,\\nbutlers and cooks) not to know exactly on which evenings people were\\nfree; and it was thus possible for the recipients of mrs. lovell\\nmingott's invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to\\nmeet the countess olenska.\\n\\nthe blow was unexpected; but the mingotts, as their way was, met it\\ngallantly.  mrs. lovell mingott confided the case to mrs. welland, who\\nconfided it to newland archer; who, aflame at the outrage, appealed\\npassionately and authoritatively to his mother; who, after a painful\\nperiod of inward resistance and outward temporising, succumbed to his\\ninstances (as she always did), and immediately embracing his cause with\\nan energy redoubled by her previous hesitations, put on her grey velvet\\nbonnet and said:  \\\"i'll go and see louisa van der luyden.\\\"\\n\\nthe new york of newland archer's day was a small and slippery pyramid,\\nin which, as yet, hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained.\\nat its base was a firm foundation of what mrs. archer called \\\"plain\\npeople\\\"; an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who\\n(as in the case of the spicers or the leffertses or the jacksons) had\\nbeen raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans.\\npeople, mrs. archer always said, were not as particular as they used to\\nbe; and with old catherine spicer ruling one end of fifth avenue, and\\njulius beaufort the other, you couldn't expect the old traditions to\\nlast much longer.\\n\\nfirmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum\\nwas the compact and dominant group which the mingotts, newlands,\\nchiverses and mansons so actively represented.  most people imagined\\nthem to be the very apex of the pyramid; but they themselves (at least\\nthose of mrs. archer's generation) were aware that, in the eyes of the\\nprofessional genealogist, only a still smaller number of families could\\nlay claim to that eminence.\\n\\n\\\"don't tell me,\\\" mrs. archer would say to her children, \\\"all this\\nmodern newspaper rubbish about a new york aristocracy.  if there is\\none, neither the mingotts nor the mansons belong to it; no, nor the\\nnewlands or the chiverses either.  our grandfathers and\\ngreat-grandfathers were just respectable english or dutch merchants,\\nwho came to the colonies to make their fortune, and stayed here because\\nthey did so well.  one of your great-grandfathers signed the\\ndeclaration, and another was a general on washington's staff, and\\nreceived general burgoyne's sword after the battle of saratoga.  these\\nare things to be proud of, but they have nothing to do with rank or\\nclass.  new york has always been a commercial community, and there are\\nnot more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin\\nin the real sense of the word.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer and her son and daughter, like every one else in new york,\\nknew who these privileged beings were: the dagonets of washington\\nsquare, who came of an old english county family allied with the pitts\\nand foxes; the lannings, who had intermarried with the descendants of\\ncount de grasse, and the van der luydens, direct descendants of the\\nfirst dutch governor of manhattan, and related by pre-revolutionary\\nmarriages to several members of the french and british aristocracy.\\n\\nthe lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively\\nmiss lannings, who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family\\nportraits and chippendale; the dagonets were a considerable clan,\\nallied to the best names in baltimore and philadelphia; but the van der\\nluydens, who stood above all of them, had faded into a kind of\\nsuper-terrestrial twilight, from which only two figures impressively\\nemerged; those of mr. and mrs. henry van der luyden.\\n\\nmrs. henry van der luyden had been louisa dagonet, and her mother had\\nbeen the granddaughter of colonel du lac, of an old channel island\\nfamily, who had fought under cornwallis and had settled in maryland,\\nafter the war, with his bride, lady angelica trevenna, fifth daughter\\nof the earl of st. austrey.  the tie between the dagonets, the du lacs\\nof maryland, and their aristocratic cornish kinsfolk, the trevennas,\\nhad always remained close and cordial.  mr. and mrs. van der luyden had\\nmore than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of\\ntrevenna, the duke of st.  austrey, at his country-seat in cornwall and\\nat st.  austrey in gloucestershire; and his grace had frequently\\nannounced his intention of some day returning their visit (without the\\nduchess, who feared the atlantic).\\n\\nmr. and mrs. van der luyden divided their time between trevenna, their\\nplace in maryland, and skuytercliff, the great estate on the hudson\\nwhich had been one of the colonial grants of the dutch government to\\nthe famous first governor, and of which mr. van der luyden was still\\n\\\"patroon.\\\"  their large solemn house in madison avenue was seldom\\nopened, and when they came to town they received in it only their most\\nintimate friends.\\n\\n\\\"i wish you would go with me, newland,\\\" his mother said, suddenly\\npausing at the door of the brown coupe.  \\\"louisa is fond of you; and of\\ncourse it's on account of dear may that i'm taking this step--and also\\nbecause, if we don't all stand together, there'll be no such thing as\\nsociety left.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmrs. henry van der luyden listened in silence to her cousin mrs.\\narcher's narrative.\\n\\nit was all very well to tell yourself in advance that mrs. van der\\nluyden was always silent, and that, though non-committal by nature and\\ntraining, she was very kind to the people she really liked.  even\\npersonal experience of these facts was not always a protection from the\\nchill that descended on one in the high-ceilinged white-walled madison\\navenue drawing-room, with the pale brocaded armchairs so obviously\\nuncovered for the occasion, and the gauze still veiling the ormolu\\nmantel ornaments and the beautiful old carved frame of gainsborough's\\n\\\"lady angelica du lac.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. van der luyden's portrait by huntington (in black velvet and\\nvenetian point) faced that of her lovely ancestress.  it was generally\\nconsidered \\\"as fine as a cabanel,\\\" and, though twenty years had elapsed\\nsince its execution, was still \\\"a perfect likeness.\\\" indeed the mrs.\\nvan der luyden who sat beneath it listening to mrs. archer might have\\nbeen the twin-sister of the fair and still youngish woman drooping\\nagainst a gilt armchair before a green rep curtain.  mrs. van der\\nluyden still wore black velvet and venetian point when she went into\\nsociety--or rather (since she never dined out) when she threw open her\\nown doors to receive it.  her fair hair, which had faded without\\nturning grey, was still parted in flat overlapping points on her\\nforehead, and the straight nose that divided her pale blue eyes was\\nonly a little more pinched about the nostrils than when the portrait\\nhad been painted.  she always, indeed, struck newland archer as having\\nbeen rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a\\nperfectly irreproachable existence, as bodies caught in glaciers keep\\nfor years a rosy life-in-death.\\n\\nlike all his family, he esteemed and admired mrs. van der luyden; but\\nhe found her gentle bending sweetness less approachable than the\\ngrimness of some of his mother's old aunts, fierce spinsters who said\\n\\\"no\\\" on principle before they knew what they were going to be asked.\\n\\nmrs. van der luyden's attitude said neither yes nor no, but always\\nappeared to incline to clemency till her thin lips, wavering into the\\nshadow of a smile, made the almost invariable reply:  \\\"i shall first\\nhave to talk this over with my husband.\\\"\\n\\nshe and mr. van der luyden were so exactly alike that archer often\\nwondered how, after forty years of the closest conjugality, two such\\nmerged identities ever separated themselves enough for anything as\\ncontroversial as a talking-over.  but as neither had ever reached a\\ndecision without prefacing it by this mysterious conclave, mrs. archer\\nand her son, having set forth their case, waited resignedly for the\\nfamiliar phrase.\\n\\nmrs. van der luyden, however, who had seldom surprised any one, now\\nsurprised them by reaching her long hand toward the bell-rope.\\n\\n\\\"i think,\\\" she said, \\\"i should like henry to hear what you have told\\nme.\\\"\\n\\na footman appeared, to whom she gravely added: \\\"if mr. van der luyden\\nhas finished reading the newspaper, please ask him to be kind enough to\\ncome.\\\"\\n\\nshe said \\\"reading the newspaper\\\" in the tone in which a minister's wife\\nmight have said:  \\\"presiding at a cabinet meeting\\\"--not from any\\narrogance of mind, but because the habit of a life-time, and the\\nattitude of her friends and relations, had led her to consider mr. van\\nder luyden's least gesture as having an almost sacerdotal importance.\\n\\nher promptness of action showed that she considered the case as\\npressing as mrs. archer; but, lest she should be thought to have\\ncommitted herself in advance, she added, with the sweetest look:\\n\\\"henry always enjoys seeing you, dear adeline; and he will wish to\\ncongratulate newland.\\\"\\n\\nthe double doors had solemnly reopened and between them appeared mr.\\nhenry van der luyden, tall, spare and frock-coated, with faded fair\\nhair, a straight nose like his wife's and the same look of frozen\\ngentleness in eyes that were merely pale grey instead of pale blue.\\n\\nmr. van der luyden greeted mrs. archer with cousinly affability,\\nproffered to newland low-voiced congratulations couched in the same\\nlanguage as his wife's, and seated himself in one of the brocade\\narmchairs with the simplicity of a reigning sovereign.\\n\\n\\\"i had just finished reading the times,\\\" he said, laying his long\\nfinger-tips together.  \\\"in town my mornings are so much occupied that i\\nfind it more convenient to read the newspapers after luncheon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, there's a great deal to be said for that plan--indeed i think my\\nuncle egmont used to say he found it less agitating not to read the\\nmorning papers till after dinner,\\\" said mrs. archer responsively.\\n\\n\\\"yes: my good father abhorred hurry.  but now we live in a constant\\nrush,\\\" said mr. van der luyden in measured tones, looking with pleasant\\ndeliberation about the large shrouded room which to archer was so\\ncomplete an image of its owners.\\n\\n\\\"but i hope you had finished your reading, henry?\\\" his wife interposed.\\n\\n\\\"quite--quite,\\\" he reassured her.\\n\\n\\\"then i should like adeline to tell you--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, it's really newland's story,\\\" said his mother smiling; and\\nproceeded to rehearse once more the monstrous tale of the affront\\ninflicted on mrs. lovell mingott.\\n\\n\\\"of course,\\\" she ended, \\\"augusta welland and mary mingott both felt\\nthat, especially in view of newland's engagement, you and henry ought\\nto know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--\\\" said mr. van der luyden, drawing a deep breath.\\n\\nthere was a silence during which the tick of the monumental ormolu\\nclock on the white marble mantelpiece grew as loud as the boom of a\\nminute-gun.  archer contemplated with awe the two slender faded\\nfigures, seated side by side in a kind of viceregal rigidity,\\nmouthpieces of some remote ancestral authority which fate compelled\\nthem to wield, when they would so much rather have lived in simplicity\\nand seclusion, digging invisible weeds out of the perfect lawns of\\nskuytercliff, and playing patience together in the evenings.\\n\\nmr. van der luyden was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\\"you really think this is due to some--some intentional interference of\\nlawrence lefferts's?\\\" he enquired, turning to archer.\\n\\n\\\"i'm certain of it, sir.  larry has been going it rather harder than\\nusual lately--if cousin louisa won't mind my mentioning it--having\\nrather a stiff affair with the postmaster's wife in their village, or\\nsome one of that sort; and whenever poor gertrude lefferts begins to\\nsuspect anything, and he's afraid of trouble, he gets up a fuss of this\\nkind, to show how awfully moral he is, and talks at the top of his\\nvoice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he\\ndoesn't wish her to know.  he's simply using madame olenska as a\\nlightning-rod; i've seen him try the same thing often before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the leffertses!--\\\" said mrs. van der luyden.\\n\\n\\\"the leffertses!--\\\" echoed mrs. archer.  \\\"what would uncle egmont have\\nsaid of lawrence lefferts's pronouncing on anybody's social position?\\nit shows what society has come to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"we'll hope it has not quite come to that,\\\" said mr. van der luyden\\nfirmly.\\n\\n\\\"ah, if only you and louisa went out more!\\\" sighed mrs. archer.\\n\\nbut instantly she became aware of her mistake.  the van der luydens\\nwere morbidly sensitive to any criticism of their secluded existence.\\nthey were the arbiters of fashion, the court of last appeal, and they\\nknew it, and bowed to their fate.  but being shy and retiring persons,\\nwith no natural inclination for their part, they lived as much as\\npossible in the sylvan solitude of skuytercliff, and when they came to\\ntown, declined all invitations on the plea of mrs. van der luyden's\\nhealth.\\n\\nnewland archer came to his mother's rescue.  \\\"everybody in new york\\nknows what you and cousin louisa represent.  that's why mrs. mingott\\nfelt she ought not to allow this slight on countess olenska to pass\\nwithout consulting you.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. van der luyden glanced at her husband, who glanced back at her.\\n\\n\\\"it is the principle that i dislike,\\\" said mr. van der luyden.  \\\"as\\nlong as a member of a well-known family is backed up by that family it\\nshould be considered--final.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it seems so to me,\\\" said his wife, as if she were producing a new\\nthought.\\n\\n\\\"i had no idea,\\\" mr. van der luyden continued, \\\"that things had come to\\nsuch a pass.\\\"  he paused, and looked at his wife again.  \\\"it occurs to\\nme, my dear, that the countess olenska is already a sort of\\nrelation--through medora manson's first husband.  at any rate, she will\\nbe when newland marries.\\\"  he turned toward the young man.  \\\"have you\\nread this morning's times, newland?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"why, yes, sir,\\\" said archer, who usually tossed off half a dozen\\npapers with his morning coffee.\\n\\nhusband and wife looked at each other again.  their pale eyes clung\\ntogether in prolonged and serious consultation; then a faint smile\\nfluttered over mrs. van der luyden's face.  she had evidently guessed\\nand approved.\\n\\nmr. van der luyden turned to mrs. archer.  \\\"if louisa's health allowed\\nher to dine out--i wish you would say to mrs. lovell mingott--she and i\\nwould have been happy to--er--fill the places of the lawrence\\nleffertses at her dinner.\\\"  he paused to let the irony of this sink in.\\n\\\"as you know, this is impossible.\\\"  mrs. archer sounded a sympathetic\\nassent.  \\\"but newland tells me he has read this morning's times;\\ntherefore he has probably seen that louisa's relative, the duke of st.\\naustrey, arrives next week on the russia.  he is coming to enter his\\nnew sloop, the guinevere, in next summer's international cup race; and\\nalso to have a little canvasback shooting at trevenna.\\\"  mr. van der\\nluyden paused again, and continued with increasing benevolence:\\n\\\"before taking him down to maryland we are inviting a few friends to\\nmeet him here--only a little dinner--with a reception afterward.  i am\\nsure louisa will be as glad as i am if countess olenska will let us\\ninclude her among our guests.\\\"  he got up, bent his long body with a\\nstiff friendliness toward his cousin, and added:  \\\"i think i have\\nlouisa's authority for saying that she will herself leave the\\ninvitation to dine when she drives out presently: with our cards--of\\ncourse with our cards.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer, who knew this to be a hint that the seventeen-hand\\nchestnuts which were never kept waiting were at the door, rose with a\\nhurried murmur of thanks.  mrs. van der luyden beamed on her with the\\nsmile of esther interceding with ahasuerus; but her husband raised a\\nprotesting hand.\\n\\n\\\"there is nothing to thank me for, dear adeline; nothing whatever.\\nthis kind of thing must not happen in new york; it shall not, as long\\nas i can help it,\\\" he pronounced with sovereign gentleness as he\\nsteered his cousins to the door.\\n\\ntwo hours later, every one knew that the great c-spring barouche in\\nwhich mrs. van der luyden took the air at all seasons had been seen at\\nold mrs. mingott's door, where a large square envelope was handed in;\\nand that evening at the opera mr. sillerton jackson was able to state\\nthat the envelope contained a card inviting the countess olenska to the\\ndinner which the van der luydens were giving the following week for\\ntheir cousin, the duke of st. austrey.\\n\\nsome of the younger men in the club box exchanged a smile at this\\nannouncement, and glanced sideways at lawrence lefferts, who sat\\ncarelessly in the front of the box, pulling his long fair moustache,\\nand who remarked with authority, as the soprano paused:  \\\"no one but\\npatti ought to attempt the sonnambula.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was generally agreed in new york that the countess olenska had \\\"lost\\nher looks.\\\"\\n\\nshe had appeared there first, in newland archer's boyhood, as a\\nbrilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten, of whom people said that\\nshe \\\"ought to be painted.\\\" her parents had been continental wanderers,\\nand after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and been taken in\\ncharge by her aunt, medora manson, also a wanderer, who was herself\\nreturning to new york to \\\"settle down.\\\"\\n\\npoor medora, repeatedly widowed, was always coming home to settle down\\n(each time in a less expensive house), and bringing with her a new\\nhusband or an adopted child; but after a few months she invariably\\nparted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward, and, having got\\nrid of her house at a loss, set out again on her wanderings.  as her\\nmother had been a rushworth, and her last unhappy marriage had linked\\nher to one of the crazy chiverses, new york looked indulgently on her\\neccentricities; but when she returned with her little orphaned niece,\\nwhose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for\\ntravel, people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in\\nsuch hands.\\n\\nevery one was disposed to be kind to little ellen mingott, though her\\ndusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed\\nunsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her\\nparents.  it was one of the misguided medora's many peculiarities to\\nflout the unalterable rules that regulated american mourning, and when\\nshe stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that\\nthe crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter\\nthan those of her sisters-in-law, while little ellen was in crimson\\nmerino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling.\\n\\nbut new york had so long resigned itself to medora that only a few old\\nladies shook their heads over ellen's gaudy clothes, while her other\\nrelations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits.\\nshe was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked disconcerting\\nquestions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts,\\nsuch as dancing a spanish shawl dance and singing neapolitan love-songs\\nto a guitar.  under the direction of her aunt (whose real name was mrs.\\nthorley chivers, but who, having received a papal title, had resumed\\nher first husband's patronymic, and called herself the marchioness\\nmanson, because in italy she could turn it into manzoni) the little\\ngirl received an expensive but incoherent education, which included\\n\\\"drawing from the model,\\\" a thing never dreamed of before, and playing\\nthe piano in quintets with professional musicians.\\n\\nof course no good could come of this; and when, a few years later, poor\\nchivers finally died in a madhouse, his widow (draped in strange weeds)\\nagain pulled up stakes and departed with ellen, who had grown into a\\ntall bony girl with conspicuous eyes.  for some time no more was heard\\nof them; then news came of ellen's marriage to an immensely rich polish\\nnobleman of legendary fame, whom she had met at a ball at the\\ntuileries, and who was said to have princely establishments in paris,\\nnice and florence, a yacht at cowes, and many square miles of shooting\\nin transylvania.  she disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis,\\nand when a few years later medora again came back to new york, subdued,\\nimpoverished, mourning a third husband, and in quest of a still smaller\\nhouse, people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do\\nsomething for her.  then came the news that ellen's own marriage had\\nended in disaster, and that she was herself returning home to seek rest\\nand oblivion among her kinsfolk.\\n\\nthese things passed through newland archer's mind a week later as he\\nwatched the countess olenska enter the van der luyden drawing-room on\\nthe evening of the momentous dinner.  the occasion was a solemn one,\\nand he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off.  she\\ncame rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a bracelet\\nabout her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or\\nembarrassment the drawing-room in which new york's most chosen company\\nwas somewhat awfully assembled.\\n\\nin the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave\\nmouth and smiling eyes; and in that instant newland archer rejected the\\ngeneral verdict on her looks.  it was true that her early radiance was\\ngone.  the red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn, a little\\nolder-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty.  but\\nthere was about her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in\\nthe carriage of the head, the movement of the eyes, which, without\\nbeing in the least theatrical, struck his as highly trained and full of\\na conscious power.  at the same time she was simpler in manner than\\nmost of the ladies present, and many people (as he heard afterward from\\njaney) were disappointed that her appearance was not more\\n\\\"stylish\\\"--for stylishness was what new york most valued.  it was,\\nperhaps, archer reflected, because her early vivacity had disappeared;\\nbecause she was so quiet--quiet in her movements, her voice, and the\\ntones of her low-pitched voice.  new york had expected something a good\\ndeal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history.\\n\\nthe dinner was a somewhat formidable business.  dining with the van der\\nluydens was at best no light matter, and dining there with a duke who\\nwas their cousin was almost a religious solemnity.  it pleased archer\\nto think that only an old new yorker could perceive the shade of\\ndifference (to new york) between being merely a duke and being the van\\nder luydens' duke.  new york took stray noblemen calmly, and even\\n(except in the struthers set) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but\\nwhen they presented such credentials as these they were received with\\nan old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken\\nin ascribing solely to their standing in debrett.  it was for just such\\ndistinctions that the young man cherished his old new york even while\\nhe smiled at it.\\n\\nthe van der luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of\\nthe occasion.  the du lac sevres and the trevenna george ii plate were\\nout; so was the van der luyden \\\"lowestoft\\\" (east india company) and the\\ndagonet crown derby.  mrs. van der luyden looked more than ever like a\\ncabanel, and mrs. archer, in her grandmother's seed-pearls and\\nemeralds, reminded her son of an isabey miniature.  all the ladies had\\non their handsomest jewels, but it was characteristic of the house and\\nthe occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy old-fashioned\\nsettings; and old miss lanning, who had been persuaded to come,\\nactually wore her mother's cameos and a spanish blonde shawl.\\n\\nthe countess olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as\\narcher scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond\\nnecklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously\\nimmature compared with hers.  it frightened him to think what must have\\ngone to the making of her eyes.\\n\\nthe duke of st. austrey, who sat at his hostess's right, was naturally\\nthe chief figure of the evening.  but if the countess olenska was less\\nconspicuous than had been hoped, the duke was almost invisible.  being\\na well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal visitor) come to\\nthe dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby\\nand baggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun,\\nthat (with his stooping way of sitting, and the vast beard spreading\\nover his shirt-front) he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner\\nattire.  he was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with a thick nose,\\nsmall eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did\\nit was in such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of\\nexpectation about the table, his remarks were lost to all but his\\nneighbours.\\n\\nwhen the men joined the ladies after dinner the duke went straight up\\nto the countess olenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into\\nanimated talk.  neither seemed aware that the duke should first have\\npaid his respects to mrs. lovell mingott and mrs. headly chivers, and\\nthe countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac, mr. urban\\ndagonet of washington square, who, in order to have the pleasure of\\nmeeting her, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out\\nbetween january and april.  the two chatted together for nearly twenty\\nminutes; then the countess rose and, walking alone across the wide\\ndrawing-room, sat down at newland archer's side.\\n\\nit was not the custom in new york drawing-rooms for a lady to get up\\nand walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of\\nanother.  etiquette required that she should wait, immovable as an\\nidol, while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each\\nother at her side.  but the countess was apparently unaware of having\\nbroken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside\\narcher, and looked at him with the kindest eyes.\\n\\n\\\"i want you to talk to me about may,\\\" she said.\\n\\ninstead of answering her he asked:  \\\"you knew the duke before?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, yes--we used to see him every winter at nice.  he's very fond of\\ngambling--he used to come to the house a great deal.\\\"  she said it in\\nthe simplest manner, as if she had said:  \\\"he's fond of wild-flowers\\\";\\nand after a moment she added candidly:  \\\"i think he's the dullest man i\\never met.\\\"\\n\\nthis pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her\\nprevious remark had caused him.  it was undeniably exciting to meet a\\nlady who found the van der luydens' duke dull, and dared to utter the\\nopinion.  he longed to question her, to hear more about the life of\\nwhich her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse; but\\nhe feared to touch on distressing memories, and before he could think\\nof anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject.\\n\\n\\\"may is a darling; i've seen no young girl in new york so handsome and\\nso intelligent.  are you very much in love with her?\\\"\\n\\nnewland archer reddened and laughed.  \\\"as much as a man can be.\\\"\\n\\nshe continued to consider him thoughtfully, as if not to miss any shade\\nof meaning in what he said, \\\"do you think, then, there is a limit?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"to being in love?  if there is, i haven't found it!\\\"\\n\\nshe glowed with sympathy.  \\\"ah--it's really and truly a romance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the most romantic of romances!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"how delightful!  and you found it all out for yourselves--it was not\\nin the least arranged for you?\\\"\\n\\narcher looked at her incredulously.  \\\"have you forgotten,\\\" he asked\\nwith a smile, \\\"that in our country we don't allow our marriages to be\\narranged for us?\\\"\\n\\na dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.\\n\\n\\\"yes,\\\" she answered, \\\"i'd forgotten.  you must forgive me if i\\nsometimes make these mistakes.  i don't always remember that everything\\nhere is good that was--that was bad where i've come from.\\\"  she looked\\ndown at her viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips\\ntrembled.\\n\\n\\\"i'm so sorry,\\\" he said impulsively; \\\"but you are among friends here,\\nyou know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes--i know.  wherever i go i have that feeling.  that's why i came\\nhome.  i want to forget everything else, to become a complete american\\nagain, like the mingotts and wellands, and you and your delightful\\nmother, and all the other good people here tonight.  ah, here's may\\narriving, and you will want to hurry away to her,\\\" she added, but\\nwithout moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the\\nyoung man's face.\\n\\nthe drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests,\\nand following madame olenska's glance archer saw may welland entering\\nwith her mother.  in her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of\\nsilver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a diana just\\nalight from the chase.\\n\\n\\\"oh,\\\" said archer, \\\"i have so many rivals; you see she's already\\nsurrounded.  there's the duke being introduced.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"then stay with me a little longer,\\\" madame olenska said in a low tone,\\njust touching his knee with her plumed fan.  it was the lightest touch,\\nbut it thrilled him like a caress.\\n\\n\\\"yes, let me stay,\\\" he answered in the same tone, hardly knowing what\\nhe said; but just then mr. van der luyden came up, followed by old mr.\\nurban dagonet.  the countess greeted them with her grave smile, and\\narcher, feeling his host's admonitory glance on him, rose and\\nsurrendered his seat.\\n\\nmadame olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye.\\n\\n\\\"tomorrow, then, after five--i shall expect you,\\\" she said; and then\\nturned back to make room for mr. dagonet.\\n\\n\\\"tomorrow--\\\" archer heard himself repeating, though there had been no\\nengagement, and during their talk she had given him no hint that she\\nwished to see him again.\\n\\nas he moved away he saw lawrence lefferts, tall and resplendent,\\nleading his wife up to be introduced; and heard gertrude lefferts say,\\nas she beamed on the countess with her large unperceiving smile:  \\\"but\\ni think we used to go to dancing-school together when we were\\nchildren--.\\\"  behind her, waiting their turn to name themselves to the\\ncountess, archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had\\ndeclined to meet her at mrs. lovell mingott's.  as mrs. archer\\nremarked: when the van der luydens chose, they knew how to give a\\nlesson.  the wonder was that they chose so seldom.\\n\\nthe young man felt a touch on his arm and saw mrs. van der luyden\\nlooking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the\\nfamily diamonds.  \\\"it was good of you, dear newland, to devote yourself\\nso unselfishly to madame olenska.  i told your cousin henry he must\\nreally come to the rescue.\\\"\\n\\nhe was aware of smiling at her vaguely, and she added, as if\\ncondescending to his natural shyness:  \\\"i've never seen may looking\\nlovelier.  the duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe countess olenska had said \\\"after five\\\"; and at half after the hour\\nnewland archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant\\nwisteria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired,\\nfar down west twenty-third street, from the vagabond medora.\\n\\nit was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in.  small\\ndress-makers, bird-stuffers and \\\"people who wrote\\\" were her nearest\\nneighbours; and further down the dishevelled street archer recognised a\\ndilapidated wooden house, at the end of a paved path, in which a writer\\nand journalist called winsett, whom he used to come across now and\\nthen, had mentioned that he lived.  winsett did not invite people to\\nhis house; but he had once pointed it out to archer in the course of a\\nnocturnal stroll, and the latter had asked himself, with a little\\nshiver, if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals.\\n\\nmadame olenska's own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance\\nonly by a little more paint about the window-frames; and as archer\\nmustered its modest front he said to himself that the polish count must\\nhave robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions.\\n\\nthe young man had spent an unsatisfactory day.  he had lunched with the\\nwellands, hoping afterward to carry off may for a walk in the park.  he\\nwanted to have her to himself, to tell her how enchanting she had\\nlooked the night before, and how proud he was of her, and to press her\\nto hasten their marriage.  but mrs. welland had firmly reminded him\\nthat the round of family visits was not half over, and, when he hinted\\nat advancing the date of the wedding, had raised reproachful eye-brows\\nand sighed out:  \\\"twelve dozen of everything--hand-embroidered--\\\"\\n\\npacked in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to\\nanother, and archer, when the afternoon's round was over, parted from\\nhis betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild\\nanimal cunningly trapped.  he supposed that his readings in\\nanthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after\\nall a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling; but when he\\nremembered that the wellands did not expect the wedding to take place\\ntill the following autumn, and pictured what his life would be till\\nthen, a dampness fell upon his spirit.\\n\\n\\\"tomorrow,\\\" mrs. welland called after him, \\\"we'll do the chiverses and\\nthe dallases\\\"; and he perceived that she was going through their two\\nfamilies alphabetically, and that they were only in the first quarter\\nof the alphabet.\\n\\nhe had meant to tell may of the countess olenska's request--her\\ncommand, rather--that he should call on her that afternoon; but in the\\nbrief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to\\nsay.  besides, it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the\\nmatter.  he knew that may most particularly wanted him to be kind to\\nher cousin; was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of\\ntheir engagement?  it gave him an odd sensation to reflect that, but\\nfor the countess's arrival, he might have been, if not still a free\\nman, at least a man less irrevocably pledged.  but may had willed it\\nso, and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibility--and\\ntherefore at liberty, if he chose, to call on her cousin without\\ntelling her.\\n\\nas he stood on madame olenska's threshold curiosity was his uppermost\\nfeeling.  he was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him; he\\nconcluded that she was less simple than she seemed.\\n\\nthe door was opened by a swarthy foreign-looking maid, with a prominent\\nbosom under a gay neckerchief, whom he vaguely fancied to be sicilian.\\nshe welcomed him with all her white teeth, and answering his enquiries\\nby a head-shake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into\\na low firelit drawing-room.  the room was empty, and she left him, for\\nan appreciable time, to wonder whether she had gone to find her\\nmistress, or whether she had not understood what he was there for, and\\nthought it might be to wind the clock--of which he perceived that the\\nonly visible specimen had stopped.  he knew that the southern races\\ncommunicated with each other in the language of pantomime, and was\\nmortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible.  at length\\nshe returned with a lamp; and archer, having meanwhile put together a\\nphrase out of dante and petrarch, evoked the answer: \\\"la signora e\\nfuori; ma verra subito\\\"; which he took to mean:  \\\"she's out--but you'll\\nsoon see.\\\"\\n\\nwhat he saw, meanwhile, with the help of the lamp, was the faded\\nshadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known.  he knew that the\\ncountess olenska had brought some of her possessions with her--bits of\\nwreckage, she called them--and these, he supposed, were represented by\\nsome small slender tables of dark wood, a delicate little greek bronze\\non the chimney-piece, and a stretch of red damask nailed on the\\ndiscoloured wallpaper behind a couple of italian-looking pictures in\\nold frames.\\n\\nnewland archer prided himself on his knowledge of italian art.  his\\nboyhood had been saturated with ruskin, and he had read all the latest\\nbooks: john addington symonds, vernon lee's \\\"euphorion,\\\" the essays of\\np. g. hamerton, and a wonderful new volume called \\\"the renaissance\\\" by\\nwalter pater.  he talked easily of botticelli, and spoke of fra\\nangelico with a faint condescension.  but these pictures bewildered\\nhim, for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at (and\\ntherefore able to see) when he travelled in italy; and perhaps, also,\\nhis powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding\\nhimself in this strange empty house, where apparently no one expected\\nhim.  he was sorry that he had not told may welland of countess\\nolenska's request, and a little disturbed by the thought that his\\nbetrothed might come in to see her cousin.  what would she think if she\\nfound him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting\\nalone in the dusk at a lady's fireside?\\n\\nbut since he had come he meant to wait; and he sank into a chair and\\nstretched his feet to the logs.\\n\\nit was odd to have summoned him in that way, and then forgotten him;\\nbut archer felt more curious than mortified.  the atmosphere of the\\nroom was so different from any he had ever breathed that\\nself-consciousness vanished in the sense of adventure.  he had been\\nbefore in drawing-rooms hung with red damask, with pictures \\\"of the\\nitalian school\\\"; what struck him was the way in which medora manson's\\nshabby hired house, with its blighted background of pampas grass and\\nrogers statuettes, had, by a turn of the hand, and the skilful use of a\\nfew properties, been transformed into something intimate, \\\"foreign,\\\"\\nsubtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments.  he tried to\\nanalyse the trick, to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and\\ntables were grouped, in the fact that only two jacqueminot roses (of\\nwhich nobody ever bought less than a dozen) had been placed in the\\nslender vase at his elbow, and in the vague pervading perfume that was\\nnot what one put on handkerchiefs, but rather like the scent of some\\nfar-off bazaar, a smell made up of turkish coffee and ambergris and\\ndried roses.\\n\\nhis mind wandered away to the question of what may's drawing-room would\\nlook like.  he knew that mr. welland, who was behaving \\\"very\\nhandsomely,\\\" already had his eye on a newly built house in east\\nthirty-ninth street.  the neighbourhood was thought remote, and the\\nhouse was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger\\narchitects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone\\nof which the uniform hue coated new york like a cold chocolate sauce;\\nbut the plumbing was perfect.  archer would have liked to travel, to\\nput off the housing question; but, though the wellands approved of an\\nextended european honeymoon (perhaps even a winter in egypt), they were\\nfirm as to the need of a house for the returning couple.  the young man\\nfelt that his fate was sealed: for the rest of his life he would go up\\nevery evening between the cast-iron railings of that greenish-yellow\\ndoorstep, and pass through a pompeian vestibule into a hall with a\\nwainscoting of varnished yellow wood.  but beyond that his imagination\\ncould not travel.  he knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but\\nhe could not fancy how may would deal with it.  she submitted\\ncheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the welland\\ndrawing-room, to its sham buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern\\nsaxe.  he saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything\\ndifferent in her own house; and his only comfort was to reflect that\\nshe would probably let him arrange his library as he pleased--which\\nwould be, of course, with \\\"sincere\\\" eastlake furniture, and the plain\\nnew bookcases without glass doors.\\n\\nthe round-bosomed maid came in, drew the curtains, pushed back a log,\\nand said consolingly: \\\"verra--verra.\\\"  when she had gone archer stood\\nup and began to wander about.  should he wait any longer?  his position\\nwas becoming rather foolish.  perhaps he had misunderstood madame\\nolenska--perhaps she had not invited him after all.\\n\\ndown the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a stepper's\\nhoofs; they stopped before the house, and he caught the opening of a\\ncarriage door.  parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk.\\na street-lamp faced him, and in its light he saw julius beaufort's\\ncompact english brougham, drawn by a big roan, and the banker\\ndescending from it, and helping out madame olenska.\\n\\nbeaufort stood, hat in hand, saying something which his companion\\nseemed to negative; then they shook hands, and he jumped into his\\ncarriage while she mounted the steps.\\n\\nwhen she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing archer\\nthere; surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to.\\n\\n\\\"how do you like my funny house?\\\" she asked.  \\\"to me it's like heaven.\\\"\\n\\nas she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away\\nwith her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes.\\n\\n\\\"you've arranged it delightfully,\\\" he rejoined, alive to the flatness\\nof the words, but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming\\ndesire to be simple and striking.\\n\\n\\\"oh, it's a poor little place.  my relations despise it.  but at any\\nrate it's less gloomy than the van der luydens'.\\\"\\n\\nthe words gave him an electric shock, for few were the rebellious\\nspirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der\\nluydens gloomy.  those privileged to enter it shivered there, and spoke\\nof it as \\\"handsome.\\\"  but suddenly he was glad that she had given voice\\nto the general shiver.\\n\\n\\\"it's delicious--what you've done here,\\\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\\"i like the little house,\\\" she admitted; \\\"but i suppose what i like is\\nthe blessedness of its being here, in my own country and my own town;\\nand then, of being alone in it.\\\"  she spoke so low that he hardly heard\\nthe last phrase; but in his awkwardness he took it up.\\n\\n\\\"you like so much to be alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes; as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely.\\\"  she sat down\\nnear the fire, said:  \\\"nastasia will bring the tea presently,\\\" and\\nsigned to him to return to his armchair, adding:  \\\"i see you've already\\nchosen your corner.\\\"\\n\\nleaning back, she folded her arms behind her head, and looked at the\\nfire under drooping lids.\\n\\n\\\"this is the hour i like best--don't you?\\\"\\n\\na proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: \\\"i was afraid you'd\\nforgotten the hour.  beaufort must have been very engrossing.\\\"\\n\\nshe looked amused.  \\\"why--have you waited long?  mr. beaufort took me\\nto see a number of houses--since it seems i'm not to be allowed to stay\\nin this one.\\\"  she appeared to dismiss both beaufort and himself from\\nher mind, and went on:  \\\"i've never been in a city where there seems to\\nbe such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques.  what\\ndoes it matter where one lives?  i'm told this street is respectable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's not fashionable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"fashionable!  do you all think so much of that?  why not make one's\\nown fashions?  but i suppose i've lived too independently; at any rate,\\ni want to do what you all do--i want to feel cared for and safe.\\\"\\n\\nhe was touched, as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her\\nneed of guidance.\\n\\n\\\"that's what your friends want you to feel.  new york's an awfully safe\\nplace,\\\" he added with a flash of sarcasm.\\n\\n\\\"yes, isn't it?  one feels that,\\\" she cried, missing the mockery.\\n\\\"being here is like--like--being taken on a holiday when one has been a\\ngood little girl and done all one's lessons.\\\"\\n\\nthe analogy was well meant, but did not altogether please him.  he did\\nnot mind being flippant about new york, but disliked to hear any one\\nelse take the same tone.  he wondered if she did not begin to see what\\na powerful engine it was, and how nearly it had crushed her.  the\\nlovell mingotts' dinner, patched up in extremis out of all sorts of\\nsocial odds and ends, ought to have taught her the narrowness of her\\nescape; but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted\\ndisaster, or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van\\nder luyden evening.  archer inclined to the former theory; he fancied\\nthat her new york was still completely undifferentiated, and the\\nconjecture nettled him.\\n\\n\\\"last night,\\\" he said, \\\"new york laid itself out for you.  the van der\\nluydens do nothing by halves.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no: how kind they are!  it was such a nice party.  every one seems to\\nhave such an esteem for them.\\\"\\n\\nthe terms were hardly adequate; she might have spoken in that way of a\\ntea-party at the dear old miss lannings'.\\n\\n\\\"the van der luydens,\\\" said archer, feeling himself pompous as he\\nspoke, \\\"are the most powerful influence in new york society.\\nunfortunately--owing to her health--they receive very seldom.\\\"\\n\\nshe unclasped her hands from behind her head, and looked at him\\nmeditatively.\\n\\n\\\"isn't that perhaps the reason?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the reason--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"for their great influence; that they make themselves so rare.\\\"\\n\\nhe coloured a little, stared at her--and suddenly felt the penetration\\nof the remark.  at a stroke she had pricked the van der luydens and\\nthey collapsed.  he laughed, and sacrificed them.\\n\\nnastasia brought the tea, with handleless japanese cups and little\\ncovered dishes, placing the tray on a low table.\\n\\n\\\"but you'll explain these things to me--you'll tell me all i ought to\\nknow,\\\" madame olenska continued, leaning forward to hand him his cup.\\n\\n\\\"it's you who are telling me; opening my eyes to things i'd looked at\\nso long that i'd ceased to see them.\\\"\\n\\nshe detached a small gold cigarette-case from one of her bracelets,\\nheld it out to him, and took a cigarette herself.  on the chimney were\\nlong spills for lighting them.\\n\\n\\\"ah, then we can both help each other.  but i want help so much more.\\nyou must tell me just what to do.\\\"\\n\\nit was on the tip of his tongue to reply:  \\\"don't be seen driving about\\nthe streets with beaufort--\\\" but he was being too deeply drawn into the\\natmosphere of the room, which was her atmosphere, and to give advice of\\nthat sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for\\nattar-of-roses in samarkand that one should always be provided with\\narctics for a new york winter.  new york seemed much farther off than\\nsamarkand, and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering\\nwhat might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look\\nat his native city objectively.  viewed thus, as through the wrong end\\nof a telescope, it looked disconcertingly small and distant; but then\\nfrom samarkand it would.\\n\\na flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire, stretching her\\nthin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails.\\nthe light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her\\nbraids, and made her pale face paler.\\n\\n\\\"there are plenty of people to tell you what to do,\\\" archer rejoined,\\nobscurely envious of them.\\n\\n\\\"oh--all my aunts?  and my dear old granny?\\\"  she considered the idea\\nimpartially.  \\\"they're all a little vexed with me for setting up for\\nmyself--poor granny especially.  she wanted to keep me with her; but i\\nhad to be free--\\\"  he was impressed by this light way of speaking of\\nthe formidable catherine, and moved by the thought of what must have\\ngiven madame olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of\\nfreedom.  but the idea of beaufort gnawed him.\\n\\n\\\"i think i understand how you feel,\\\" he said.  \\\"still, your family can\\nadvise you; explain differences; show you the way.\\\"\\n\\nshe lifted her thin black eyebrows.  \\\"is new york such a labyrinth?  i\\nthought it so straight up and down--like fifth avenue.  and with all\\nthe cross streets numbered!\\\"  she seemed to guess his faint disapproval\\nof this, and added, with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face:\\n\\\"if you knew how i like it for just that--the straight-up-and-downness,\\nand the big honest labels on everything!\\\"\\n\\nhe saw his chance.  \\\"everything may be labelled--but everybody is not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"perhaps.  i may simplify too much--but you'll warn me if i do.\\\"  she\\nturned from the fire to look at him.  \\\"there are only two people here\\nwho make me feel as if they understood what i mean and could explain\\nthings to me: you and mr. beaufort.\\\"\\n\\narcher winced at the joining of the names, and then, with a quick\\nreadjustment, understood, sympathised and pitied.  so close to the\\npowers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely\\nin their air.  but since she felt that he understood her also, his\\nbusiness would be to make her see beaufort as he really was, with all\\nhe represented--and abhor it.\\n\\nhe answered gently:  \\\"i understand.  but just at first don't let go of\\nyour old friends' hands: i mean the older women, your granny mingott,\\nmrs. welland, mrs. van der luyden.  they like and admire you--they want\\nto help you.\\\"\\n\\nshe shook her head and sighed.  \\\"oh, i know--i know!  but on condition\\nthat they don't hear anything unpleasant.  aunt welland put it in those\\nvery words when i tried....  does no one want to know the truth here,\\nmr. archer?  the real loneliness is living among all these kind people\\nwho only ask one to pretend!\\\" she lifted her hands to her face, and he\\nsaw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob.\\n\\n\\\"madame olenska!--oh, don't, ellen,\\\" he cried, starting up and bending\\nover her.  he drew down one of her hands, clasping and chafing it like\\na child's while he murmured reassuring words; but in a moment she freed\\nherself, and looked up at him with wet lashes.\\n\\n\\\"does no one cry here, either?  i suppose there's no need to, in\\nheaven,\\\" she said, straightening her loosened braids with a laugh, and\\nbending over the tea-kettle.  it was burnt into his consciousness that\\nhe had called her \\\"ellen\\\"--called her so twice; and that she had not\\nnoticed it.  far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white\\nfigure of may welland--in new york.\\n\\nsuddenly nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich italian.\\n\\nmadame olenska, again with a hand at her hair, uttered an exclamation\\nof assent--a flashing \\\"gia--gia\\\"--and the duke of st. austrey entered,\\npiloting a tremendous blackwigged and red-plumed lady in overflowing\\nfurs.\\n\\n\\\"my dear countess, i've brought an old friend of mine to see you--mrs.\\nstruthers.  she wasn't asked to the party last night, and she wants to\\nknow you.\\\"\\n\\nthe duke beamed on the group, and madame olenska advanced with a murmur\\nof welcome toward the queer couple.  she seemed to have no idea how\\noddly matched they were, nor what a liberty the duke had taken in\\nbringing his companion--and to do him justice, as archer perceived, the\\nduke seemed as unaware of it himself.\\n\\n\\\"of course i want to know you, my dear,\\\" cried mrs. struthers in a\\nround rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig.\\n\\\"i want to know everybody who's young and interesting and charming.\\nand the duke tells me you like music--didn't you, duke?  you're a\\npianist yourself, i believe?  well, do you want to hear sarasate play\\ntomorrow evening at my house?  you know i've something going on every\\nsunday evening--it's the day when new york doesn't know what to do with\\nitself, and so i say to it:  'come and be amused.'  and the duke\\nthought you'd be tempted by sarasate.  you'll find a number of your\\nfriends.\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska's face grew brilliant with pleasure.  \\\"how kind!  how\\ngood of the duke to think of me!\\\" she pushed a chair up to the\\ntea-table and mrs. struthers sank into it delectably.  \\\"of course i\\nshall be too happy to come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"that's all right, my dear.  and bring your young gentleman with you.\\\"\\nmrs. struthers extended a hail-fellow hand to archer.  \\\"i can't put a\\nname to you--but i'm sure i've met you--i've met everybody, here, or in\\nparis or london.  aren't you in diplomacy?  all the diplomatists come\\nto me.  you like music too?  duke, you must be sure to bring him.\\\"\\n\\nthe duke said \\\"rather\\\" from the depths of his beard, and archer\\nwithdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of\\nspine as a self-conscious school-boy among careless and unnoticing\\nelders.\\n\\nhe was not sorry for the denouement of his visit: he only wished it had\\ncome sooner, and spared him a certain waste of emotion.  as he went out\\ninto the wintry night, new york again became vast and imminent, and may\\nwelland the loveliest woman in it.  he turned into his florist's to\\nsend her the daily box of lilies-of-the-valley which, to his confusion,\\nhe found he had forgotten that morning.\\n\\nas he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced\\nabout the embowered shop, and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses.\\nhe had never seen any as sun-golden before, and his first impulse was\\nto send them to may instead of the lilies.  but they did not look like\\nher--there was something too rich, too strong, in their fiery beauty.\\nin a sudden revulsion of mood, and almost without knowing what he did,\\nhe signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box, and\\nslipped his card into a second envelope, on which he wrote the name of\\nthe countess olenska; then, just as he was turning away, he drew the\\ncard out again, and left the empty envelope on the box.\\n\\n\\\"they'll go at once?\\\" he enquired, pointing to the roses.\\n\\nthe florist assured him that they would.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe next day he persuaded may to escape for a walk in the park after\\nluncheon.  as was the custom in old-fashioned episcopalian new york,\\nshe usually accompanied her parents to church on sunday afternoons; but\\nmrs. welland condoned her truancy, having that very morning won her\\nover to the necessity of a long engagement, with time to prepare a\\nhand-embroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens.\\n\\nthe day was delectable.  the bare vaulting of trees along the mall was\\nceiled with lapis lazuli, and arched above snow that shone like\\nsplintered crystals.  it was the weather to call out may's radiance,\\nand she burned like a young maple in the frost.  archer was proud of\\nthe glances turned on her, and the simple joy of possessorship cleared\\naway his underlying perplexities.\\n\\n\\\"it's so delicious--waking every morning to smell lilies-of-the-valley\\nin one's room!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"yesterday they came late.  i hadn't time in the morning--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much\\nmore than if you'd given a standing order, and they came every morning\\non the minute, like one's music-teacher--as i know gertrude lefferts's\\ndid, for instance, when she and lawrence were engaged.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--they would!\\\" laughed archer, amused at her keenness.  he looked\\nsideways at her fruit-like cheek and felt rich and secure enough to\\nadd:  \\\"when i sent your lilies yesterday afternoon i saw some rather\\ngorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to madame olenska.  was that\\nright?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"how dear of you!  anything of that kind delights her.  it's odd she\\ndidn't mention it: she lunched with us today, and spoke of mr.\\nbeaufort's having sent her wonderful orchids, and cousin henry van der\\nluyden a whole hamper of carnations from skuytercliff.  she seems so\\nsurprised to receive flowers.  don't people send them in europe?  she\\nthinks it such a pretty custom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, well, no wonder mine were overshadowed by beaufort's,\\\" said archer\\nirritably.  then he remembered that he had not put a card with the\\nroses, and was vexed at having spoken of them.  he wanted to say:  \\\"i\\ncalled on your cousin yesterday,\\\" but hesitated.  if madame olenska had\\nnot spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should.  yet not\\nto do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked.  to shake\\noff the question he began to talk of their own plans, their future, and\\nmrs. welland's insistence on a long engagement.\\n\\n\\\"if you call it long!  isabel chivers and reggie were engaged for two\\nyears: grace and thorley for nearly a year and a half.  why aren't we\\nvery well off as we are?\\\"\\n\\nit was the traditional maidenly interrogation, and he felt ashamed of\\nhimself for finding it singularly childish.  no doubt she simply echoed\\nwhat was said for her; but she was nearing her twenty-second birthday,\\nand he wondered at what age \\\"nice\\\" women began to speak for themselves.\\n\\n\\\"never, if we won't let them, i suppose,\\\" he mused, and recalled his\\nmad outburst to mr. sillerton jackson: \\\"women ought to be as free as we\\nare--\\\"\\n\\nit would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young\\nwoman's eyes, and bid her look forth on the world.  but how many\\ngenerations of the women who had gone to her making had descended\\nbandaged to the family vault?  he shivered a little, remembering some\\nof the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much-cited instance\\nof the kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because\\nthey had no use for them.  what if, when he had bidden may welland to\\nopen hers, they could only look out blankly at blankness?\\n\\n\\\"we might be much better off.  we might be altogether together--we\\nmight travel.\\\"\\n\\nher face lit up.  \\\"that would be lovely,\\\" she owned: she would love to\\ntravel.  but her mother would not understand their wanting to do things\\nso differently.\\n\\n\\\"as if the mere 'differently' didn't account for it!\\\" the wooer\\ninsisted.\\n\\n\\\"newland!  you're so original!\\\" she exulted.\\n\\nhis heart sank, for he saw that he was saying all the things that young\\nmen in the same situation were expected to say, and that she was making\\nthe answers that instinct and tradition taught her to make--even to the\\npoint of calling him original.\\n\\n\\\"original!  we're all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the\\nsame folded paper.  we're like patterns stencilled on a wall.  can't\\nyou and i strike out for ourselves, may?\\\"\\n\\nhe had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion, and\\nher eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration.\\n\\n\\\"mercy--shall we elope?\\\" she laughed.\\n\\n\\\"if you would--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you do love me, newland!  i'm so happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but then--why not be happier?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"we can't behave like people in novels, though, can we?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"why not--why not--why not?\\\"\\n\\nshe looked a little bored by his insistence.  she knew very well that\\nthey couldn't, but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason.\\n\\\"i'm not clever enough to argue with you.  but that kind of thing is\\nrather--vulgar, isn't it?\\\" she suggested, relieved to have hit on a\\nword that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject.\\n\\n\\\"are you so much afraid, then, of being vulgar?\\\"\\n\\nshe was evidently staggered by this.  \\\"of course i should hate it--so\\nwould you,\\\" she rejoined, a trifle irritably.\\n\\nhe stood silent, beating his stick nervously against his boot-top; and\\nfeeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the\\ndiscussion, she went on light-heartedly: \\\"oh, did i tell you that i\\nshowed ellen my ring?  she thinks it the most beautiful setting she\\never saw.  there's nothing like it in the rue de la paix, she said.  i\\ndo love you, newland, for being so artistic!\\\"\\n\\n\\nthe next afternoon, as archer, before dinner, sat smoking sullenly in\\nhis study, janey wandered in on him.  he had failed to stop at his club\\non the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the\\nlaw in the leisurely manner common to well-to-do new yorkers of his\\nclass.  he was out of spirits and slightly out of temper, and a\\nhaunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour\\nbesieged his brain.\\n\\n\\\"sameness--sameness!\\\" he muttered, the word running through his head\\nlike a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tall-hatted figures\\nlounging behind the plate-glass; and because he usually dropped in at\\nthe club at that hour he had gone home instead.  he knew not only what\\nthey were likely to be talking about, but the part each one would take\\nin the discussion.  the duke of course would be their principal theme;\\nthough the appearance in fifth avenue of a golden-haired lady in a\\nsmall canary-coloured brougham with a pair of black cobs (for which\\nbeaufort was generally thought responsible) would also doubtless be\\nthoroughly gone into.  such \\\"women\\\" (as they were called) were few in\\nnew york, those driving their own carriages still fewer, and the\\nappearance of miss fanny ring in fifth avenue at the fashionable hour\\nhad profoundly agitated society.  only the day before, her carriage had\\npassed mrs. lovell mingott's, and the latter had instantly rung the\\nlittle bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home.\\n\\\"what if it had happened to mrs. van der luyden?\\\" people asked each\\nother with a shudder.  archer could hear lawrence lefferts, at that\\nvery hour, holding forth on the disintegration of society.\\n\\nhe raised his head irritably when his sister janey entered, and then\\nquickly bent over his book (swinburne's \\\"chastelard\\\"--just out) as if\\nhe had not seen her.  she glanced at the writing-table heaped with\\nbooks, opened a volume of the \\\"contes drolatiques,\\\" made a wry face\\nover the archaic french, and sighed:  \\\"what learned things you read!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--?\\\" he asked, as she hovered cassandra-like before him.\\n\\n\\\"mother's very angry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"angry?  with whom?  about what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"miss sophy jackson has just been here.  she brought word that her\\nbrother would come in after dinner: she couldn't say very much, because\\nhe forbade her to: he wishes to give all the details himself.  he's\\nwith cousin louisa van der luyden now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"for heaven's sake, my dear girl, try a fresh start.  it would take an\\nomniscient deity to know what you're talking about.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's not a time to be profane, newland....  mother feels badly enough\\nabout your not going to church ...\\\"\\n\\nwith a groan he plunged back into his book.\\n\\n\\\"newland!  do listen.  your friend madame olenska was at mrs. lemuel\\nstruthers's party last night: she went there with the duke and mr.\\nbeaufort.\\\"\\n\\nat the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the\\nyoung man's breast.  to smother it he laughed.  \\\"well, what of it?  i\\nknew she meant to.\\\"\\n\\njaney paled and her eyes began to project.  \\\"you knew she meant to--and\\nyou didn't try to stop her?  to warn her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"stop her?  warn her?\\\"  he laughed again.  \\\"i'm not engaged to be\\nmarried to the countess olenska!\\\"  the words had a fantastic sound in\\nhis own ears.\\n\\n\\\"you're marrying into her family.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, family--family!\\\" he jeered.\\n\\n\\\"newland--don't you care about family?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"not a brass farthing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"nor about what cousin louisa van der luyden will think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"not the half of one--if she thinks such old maid's rubbish.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"mother is not an old maid,\\\" said his virgin sister with pinched lips.\\n\\nhe felt like shouting back:  \\\"yes, she is, and so are the van der\\nluydens, and so we all are, when it comes to being so much as brushed\\nby the wing-tip of reality.\\\" but he saw her long gentle face puckering\\ninto tears, and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting.\\n\\n\\\"hang countess olenska!  don't be a goose, janey--i'm not her keeper.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no; but you did ask the wellands to announce your engagement sooner so\\nthat we might all back her up; and if it hadn't been for that cousin\\nlouisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the duke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--what harm was there in inviting her?  she was the best-looking\\nwoman in the room; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the\\nusual van der luyden banquet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you know cousin henry asked her to please you: he persuaded cousin\\nlouisa.  and now they're so upset that they're going back to\\nskuytercliff tomorrow.  i think, newland, you'd better come down.  you\\ndon't seem to understand how mother feels.\\\"\\n\\nin the drawing-room newland found his mother.  she raised a troubled\\nbrow from her needlework to ask: \\\"has janey told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"  he tried to keep his tone as measured as her own.  \\\"but i can't\\ntake it very seriously.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"not the fact of having offended cousin louisa and cousin henry?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as countess\\nolenska's going to the house of a woman they consider common.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"consider--!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, who is; but who has good music, and amuses people on sunday\\nevenings, when the whole of new york is dying of inanition.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"good music?  all i know is, there was a woman who got up on a table\\nand sang the things they sing at the places you go to in paris.  there\\nwas smoking and champagne.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--that kind of thing happens in other places, and the world still\\ngoes on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i don't suppose, dear, you're really defending the french sunday?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i've heard you often enough, mother, grumble at the english sunday\\nwhen we've been in london.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"new york is neither paris nor london.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, no, it's not!\\\" her son groaned.\\n\\n\\\"you mean, i suppose, that society here is not as brilliant?  you're\\nright, i daresay; but we belong here, and people should respect our\\nways when they come among us.  ellen olenska especially: she came back\\nto get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies.\\\"\\n\\nnewland made no answer, and after a moment his mother ventured:  \\\"i was\\ngoing to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin louisa\\nfor a moment before dinner.\\\"  he frowned, and she continued: \\\"i thought\\nyou might explain to her what you've just said: that society abroad is\\ndifferent ... that people are not as particular, and that madame\\nolenska may not have realised how we feel about such things.  it would\\nbe, you know, dear,\\\" she added with an innocent adroitness, \\\"in madame\\nolenska's interest if you did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"dearest mother, i really don't see how we're concerned in the matter.\\nthe duke took madame olenska to mrs. struthers's--in fact he brought\\nmrs. struthers to call on her.  i was there when they came.  if the van\\nder luydens want to quarrel with anybody, the real culprit is under\\ntheir own roof.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"quarrel?  newland, did you ever know of cousin henry's quarrelling?\\nbesides, the duke's his guest; and a stranger too.  strangers don't\\ndiscriminate: how should they?  countess olenska is a new yorker, and\\nshould have respected the feelings of new york.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, then, if they must have a victim, you have my leave to throw\\nmadame olenska to them,\\\" cried her son, exasperated.  \\\"i don't see\\nmyself--or you either--offering ourselves up to expiate her crimes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, of course you see only the mingott side,\\\" his mother answered, in\\nthe sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger.\\n\\nthe sad butler drew back the drawing-room portieres and announced:\\n\\\"mr. henry van der luyden.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an\\nagitated hand.\\n\\n\\\"another lamp,\\\" she cried to the retreating servant, while janey bent\\nover to straighten her mother's cap.\\n\\nmr. van der luyden's figure loomed on the threshold, and newland archer\\nwent forward to greet his cousin.\\n\\n\\\"we were just talking about you, sir,\\\" he said.\\n\\nmr. van der luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement.  he drew off\\nhis glove to shake hands with the ladies, and smoothed his tall hat\\nshyly, while janey pushed an arm-chair forward, and archer continued:\\n\\\"and the countess olenska.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer paled.\\n\\n\\\"ah--a charming woman.  i have just been to see her,\\\" said mr. van der\\nluyden, complacency restored to his brow.  he sank into the chair, laid\\nhis hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the old-fashioned way,\\nand went on:  \\\"she has a real gift for arranging flowers.  i had sent\\nher a few carnations from skuytercliff, and i was astonished.  instead\\nof massing them in big bunches as our head-gardener does, she had\\nscattered them about loosely, here and there ... i can't say how.  the\\nduke had told me: he said:  'go and see how cleverly she's arranged her\\ndrawing-room.'  and she has.  i should really like to take louisa to\\nsee her, if the neighbourhood were not so--unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\na dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from mr. van der\\nluyden.  mrs. archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which\\nshe had nervously tumbled it, and newland, leaning against the\\nchimney-place and twisting a humming-bird-feather screen in his hand,\\nsaw janey's gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp.\\n\\n\\\"the fact is,\\\" mr. van der luyden continued, stroking his long grey leg\\nwith a bloodless hand weighed down by the patroon's great signet-ring,\\n\\\"the fact is, i dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she\\nwrote me about my flowers; and also--but this is between ourselves, of\\ncourse--to give her a friendly warning about allowing the duke to carry\\nher off to parties with him.  i don't know if you've heard--\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer produced an indulgent smile.  \\\"has the duke been carrying\\nher off to parties?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you know what these english grandees are.  they're all alike.  louisa\\nand i are very fond of our cousin--but it's hopeless to expect people\\nwho are accustomed to the european courts to trouble themselves about\\nour little republican distinctions.  the duke goes where he's amused.\\\"\\nmr. van der luyden paused, but no one spoke.  \\\"yes--it seems he took\\nher with him last night to mrs. lemuel struthers's.  sillerton jackson\\nhas just been to us with the foolish story, and louisa was rather\\ntroubled.  so i thought the shortest way was to go straight to countess\\nolenska and explain--by the merest hint, you know--how we feel in new\\nyork about certain things.  i felt i might, without indelicacy, because\\nthe evening she dined with us she rather suggested ... rather let me\\nsee that she would be grateful for guidance.  and she was.\\\"\\n\\nmr. van der luyden looked about the room with what would have been\\nself-satisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions.  on\\nhis face it became a mild benevolence which mrs. archer's countenance\\ndutifully reflected.\\n\\n\\\"how kind you both are, dear henry--always!  newland will particularly\\nappreciate what you have done because of dear may and his new\\nrelations.\\\"\\n\\nshe shot an admonitory glance at her son, who said: \\\"immensely, sir.\\nbut i was sure you'd like madame olenska.\\\"\\n\\nmr. van der luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness.  \\\"i never ask\\nto my house, my dear newland,\\\" he said, \\\"any one whom i do not like.\\nand so i have just told sillerton jackson.\\\"  with a glance at the clock\\nhe rose and added:  \\\"but louisa will be waiting.  we are dining early,\\nto take the duke to the opera.\\\"\\n\\nafter the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence\\nfell upon the archer family.\\n\\n\\\"gracious--how romantic!\\\" at last broke explosively from janey.  no one\\nknew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments, and her relations had\\nlong since given up trying to interpret them.\\n\\nmrs. archer shook her head with a sigh.  \\\"provided it all turns out for\\nthe best,\\\" she said, in the tone of one who knows how surely it will\\nnot.  \\\"newland, you must stay and see sillerton jackson when he comes\\nthis evening: i really shan't know what to say to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"poor mother!  but he won't come--\\\" her son laughed, stooping to kiss\\naway her frown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsome two weeks later, newland archer, sitting in abstracted idleness in\\nhis private compartment of the office of letterblair, lamson and low,\\nattorneys at law, was summoned by the head of the firm.\\n\\nold mr. letterblair, the accredited legal adviser of three generations\\nof new york gentility, throned behind his mahogany desk in evident\\nperplexity.  as he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his\\nhand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows, his\\ndisrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the family\\nphysician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified.\\n\\n\\\"my dear sir--\\\" he always addressed archer as \\\"sir\\\"--\\\"i have sent for\\nyou to go into a little matter; a matter which, for the moment, i\\nprefer not to mention either to mr. skipworth or mr. redwood.\\\"  the\\ngentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm; for,\\nas was always the case with legal associations of old standing in new\\nyork, all the partners named on the office letter-head were long since\\ndead; and mr. letterblair, for example, was, professionally speaking,\\nhis own grandson.\\n\\nhe leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow.  \\\"for family\\nreasons--\\\" he continued.\\n\\narcher looked up.\\n\\n\\\"the mingott family,\\\" said mr. letterblair with an explanatory smile\\nand bow.  \\\"mrs. manson mingott sent for me yesterday.  her\\ngrand-daughter the countess olenska wishes to sue her husband for\\ndivorce.  certain papers have been placed in my hands.\\\"  he paused and\\ndrummed on his desk.  \\\"in view of your prospective alliance with the\\nfamily i should like to consult you--to consider the case with\\nyou--before taking any farther steps.\\\"\\n\\narcher felt the blood in his temples.  he had seen the countess olenska\\nonly once since his visit to her, and then at the opera, in the mingott\\nbox.  during this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate\\nimage, receding from his foreground as may welland resumed her rightful\\nplace in it.  he had not heard her divorce spoken of since janey's\\nfirst random allusion to it, and had dismissed the tale as unfounded\\ngossip.  theoretically, the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful\\nto him as to his mother; and he was annoyed that mr. letterblair (no\\ndoubt prompted by old catherine mingott) should be so evidently\\nplanning to draw him into the affair.  after all, there were plenty of\\nmingott men for such jobs, and as yet he was not even a mingott by\\nmarriage.\\n\\nhe waited for the senior partner to continue.  mr. letterblair unlocked\\na drawer and drew out a packet.  \\\"if you will run your eye over these\\npapers--\\\"\\n\\narcher frowned.  \\\"i beg your pardon, sir; but just because of the\\nprospective relationship, i should prefer your consulting mr. skipworth\\nor mr. redwood.\\\"\\n\\nmr. letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended.  it was unusual\\nfor a junior to reject such an opening.\\n\\nhe bowed.  \\\"i respect your scruple, sir; but in this case i believe\\ntrue delicacy requires you to do as i ask.  indeed, the suggestion is\\nnot mine but mrs. manson mingott's and her son's.  i have seen lovell\\nmingott; and also mr. welland.  they all named you.\\\"\\n\\narcher felt his temper rising.  he had been somewhat languidly drifting\\nwith events for the last fortnight, and letting may's fair looks and\\nradiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the\\nmingott claims.  but this behest of old mrs. mingott's roused him to a\\nsense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a\\nprospective son-in-law; and he chafed at the role.\\n\\n\\\"her uncles ought to deal with this,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"they have.  the matter has been gone into by the family.  they are\\nopposed to the countess's idea; but she is firm, and insists on a legal\\nopinion.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man was silent: he had not opened the packet in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"does she want to marry again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i believe it is suggested; but she denies it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"then--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"will you oblige me, mr. archer, by first looking through these papers?\\nafterward, when we have talked the case over, i will give you my\\nopinion.\\\"\\n\\narcher withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents.  since their\\nlast meeting he had half-unconsciously collaborated with events in\\nridding himself of the burden of madame olenska.  his hour alone with\\nher by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which\\nthe duke of st. austrey's intrusion with mrs. lemuel struthers, and the\\ncountess's joyous greeting of them, had rather providentially broken.\\ntwo days later archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement\\nin the van der luydens' favour, and had said to himself, with a touch\\nof tartness, that a lady who knew how to thank all-powerful elderly\\ngentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need\\neither the private consolations or the public championship of a young\\nman of his small compass.  to look at the matter in this light\\nsimplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim\\ndomestic virtues.  he could not picture may welland, in whatever\\nconceivable emergency, hawking about her private difficulties and\\nlavishing her confidences on strange men; and she had never seemed to\\nhim finer or fairer than in the week that followed.  he had even\\nyielded to her wish for a long engagement, since she had found the one\\ndisarming answer to his plea for haste.\\n\\n\\\"you know, when it comes to the point, your parents have always let you\\nhave your way ever since you were a little girl,\\\" he argued; and she\\nhad answered, with her clearest look:  \\\"yes; and that's what makes it\\nso hard to refuse the very last thing they'll ever ask of me as a\\nlittle girl.\\\"\\n\\nthat was the old new york note; that was the kind of answer he would\\nlike always to be sure of his wife's making.  if one had habitually\\nbreathed the new york air there were times when anything less\\ncrystalline seemed stifling.\\n\\n\\nthe papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact; but\\nthey plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered.\\nthey consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between count olenski's\\nsolicitors and a french legal firm to whom the countess had applied for\\nthe settlement of her financial situation.  there was also a short\\nletter from the count to his wife: after reading it, newland archer\\nrose, jammed the papers back into their envelope, and reentered mr.\\nletterblair's office.\\n\\n\\\"here are the letters, sir.  if you wish, i'll see madame olenska,\\\" he\\nsaid in a constrained voice.\\n\\n\\\"thank you--thank you, mr. archer.  come and dine with me tonight if\\nyou're free, and we'll go into the matter afterward: in case you wish\\nto call on our client tomorrow.\\\"\\n\\nnewland archer walked straight home again that afternoon.  it was a\\nwinter evening of transparent clearness, with an innocent young moon\\nabove the house-tops; and he wanted to fill his soul's lungs with the\\npure radiance, and not exchange a word with any one till he and mr.\\nletterblair were closeted together after dinner.  it was impossible to\\ndecide otherwise than he had done: he must see madame olenska himself\\nrather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes.  a great wave of\\ncompassion had swept away his indifference and impatience: she stood\\nbefore him as an exposed and pitiful figure, to be saved at all costs\\nfrom farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate.\\n\\nhe remembered what she had told him of mrs. welland's request to be\\nspared whatever was \\\"unpleasant\\\" in her history, and winced at the\\nthought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the new\\nyork air so pure.  \\\"are we only pharisees after all?\\\" he wondered,\\npuzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human\\nvileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty.\\n\\nfor the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had\\nalways been.  he passed for a young man who had not been afraid of\\nrisks, and he knew that his secret love-affair with poor silly mrs.\\nthorley rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming\\nair of adventure.  but mrs. rushworth was \\\"that kind of woman\\\";\\nfoolish, vain, clandestine by nature, and far more attracted by the\\nsecrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he\\npossessed.  when the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart, but\\nnow it seemed the redeeming feature of the case.  the affair, in short,\\nhad been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been\\nthrough, and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed\\nbelief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and\\nrespected and those one enjoyed--and pitied.  in this view they were\\nsedulously abetted by their mothers, aunts and other elderly female\\nrelatives, who all shared mrs. archer's belief that when \\\"such things\\nhappened\\\" it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always\\ncriminal of the woman.  all the elderly ladies whom archer knew\\nregarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous\\nand designing, and mere simple-minded man as powerless in her clutches.\\nthe only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to\\nmarry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him.\\n\\nin the complicated old european communities, archer began to guess,\\nlove-problems might be less simple and less easily classified.  rich\\nand idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such\\nsituations; and there might even be one in which a woman naturally\\nsensitive and aloof would yet, from the force of circumstances, from\\nsheer defencelessness and loneliness, be drawn into a tie inexcusable\\nby conventional standards.\\n\\non reaching home he wrote a line to the countess olenska, asking at\\nwhat hour of the next day she could receive him, and despatched it by a\\nmessenger-boy, who returned presently with a word to the effect that\\nshe was going to skuytercliff the next morning to stay over sunday with\\nthe van der luydens, but that he would find her alone that evening\\nafter dinner.  the note was written on a rather untidy half-sheet,\\nwithout date or address, but her hand was firm and free.  he was amused\\nat the idea of her week-ending in the stately solitude of skuytercliff,\\nbut immediately afterward felt that there, of all places, she would\\nmost feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the \\\"unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\n\\nhe was at mr. letterblair's punctually at seven, glad of the pretext\\nfor excusing himself soon after dinner.  he had formed his own opinion\\nfrom the papers entrusted to him, and did not especially want to go\\ninto the matter with his senior partner.  mr. letterblair was a\\nwidower, and they dined alone, copiously and slowly, in a dark shabby\\nroom hung with yellowing prints of \\\"the death of chatham\\\" and \\\"the\\ncoronation of napoleon.\\\"  on the sideboard, between fluted sheraton\\nknife-cases, stood a decanter of haut brion, and another of the old\\nlanning port (the gift of a client), which the wastrel tom lanning had\\nsold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in\\nsan francisco--an incident less publicly humiliating to the family than\\nthe sale of the cellar.\\n\\nafter a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers, then a young\\nbroiled turkey with corn fritters, followed by a canvas-back with\\ncurrant jelly and a celery mayonnaise.  mr. letterblair, who lunched on\\na sandwich and tea, dined deliberately and deeply, and insisted on his\\nguest's doing the same.  finally, when the closing rites had been\\naccomplished, the cloth was removed, cigars were lit, and mr.\\nletterblair, leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward,\\nsaid, spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him:  \\\"the\\nwhole family are against a divorce.  and i think rightly.\\\"\\n\\narcher instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument.  \\\"but\\nwhy, sir?  if there ever was a case--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--what's the use?  she's here--he's there; the atlantic's between\\nthem.  she'll never get back a dollar more of her money than what he's\\nvoluntarily returned to her: their damned heathen marriage settlements\\ntake precious good care of that.  as things go over there, olenski's\\nacted generously: he might have turned her out without a penny.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man knew this and was silent.\\n\\n\\\"i understand, though,\\\" mr. letterblair continued, \\\"that she attaches\\nno importance to the money.  therefore, as the family say, why not let\\nwell enough alone?\\\"\\n\\narcher had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with mr.\\nletterblair's view; but put into words by this selfish, well-fed and\\nsupremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the pharisaic voice of\\na society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant.\\n\\n\\\"i think that's for her to decide.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"h'm--have you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you mean the threat in her husband's letter?  what weight would that\\ncarry?  it's no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the\\nsuit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"unpleasant--!\\\" said archer explosively.\\n\\nmr. letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows, and the\\nyoung man, aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in\\nhis mind, bowed acquiescently while his senior continued:  \\\"divorce is\\nalways unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you agree with me?\\\" mr. letterblair resumed, after a waiting silence.\\n\\n\\\"naturally,\\\" said archer.\\n\\n\\\"well, then, i may count on you; the mingotts may count on you; to use\\nyour influence against the idea?\\\"\\n\\narcher hesitated.  \\\"i can't pledge myself till i've seen the countess\\nolenska,\\\" he said at length.\\n\\n\\\"mr. archer, i don't understand you.  do you want to marry into a\\nfamily with a scandalous divorce-suit hanging over it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i don't think that has anything to do with the case.\\\"\\n\\nmr. letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young\\npartner a cautious and apprehensive gaze.\\n\\narcher understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn,\\nand for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect.  now that the job\\nhad been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it; and, to\\nguard against the possibility, he saw that he must reassure the\\nunimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the mingotts.\\n\\n\\\"you may be sure, sir, that i shan't commit myself till i've reported\\nto you; what i meant was that i'd rather not give an opinion till i've\\nheard what madame olenska has to say.\\\"\\n\\nmr. letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of\\nthe best new york tradition, and the young man, glancing at his watch,\\npleaded an engagement and took leave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nold-fashioned new york dined at seven, and the habit of after-dinner\\ncalls, though derided in archer's set, still generally prevailed.  as\\nthe young man strolled up fifth avenue from waverley place, the long\\nthoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before\\nthe reggie chiverses' (where there was a dinner for the duke), and the\\noccasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler\\nascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas-lit hall.\\nthus, as archer crossed washington square, he remarked that old mr. du\\nlac was calling on his cousins the dagonets, and turning down the\\ncorner of west tenth street he saw mr. skipworth, of his own firm,\\nobviously bound on a visit to the miss lannings.  a little farther up\\nfifth avenue, beaufort appeared on his doorstep, darkly projected\\nagainst a blaze of light, descended to his private brougham, and rolled\\naway to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination.  it was\\nnot an opera night, and no one was giving a party, so that beaufort's\\nouting was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature.  archer connected it in\\nhis mind with a little house beyond lexington avenue in which\\nberibboned window curtains and flower-boxes had recently appeared, and\\nbefore whose newly painted door the canary-coloured brougham of miss\\nfanny ring was frequently seen to wait.\\n\\nbeyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed mrs. archer's\\nworld lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists, musicians\\nand \\\"people who wrote.\\\"  these scattered fragments of humanity had\\nnever shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure.  in\\nspite of odd ways they were said to be, for the most part, quite\\nrespectable; but they preferred to keep to themselves.  medora manson,\\nin her prosperous days, had inaugurated a \\\"literary salon\\\"; but it had\\nsoon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it.\\n\\nothers had made the same attempt, and there was a household of\\nblenkers--an intense and voluble mother, and three blowsy daughters who\\nimitated her--where one met edwin booth and patti and william winter,\\nand the new shakespearian actor george rignold, and some of the\\nmagazine editors and musical and literary critics.\\n\\nmrs. archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these\\npersons.  they were odd, they were uncertain, they had things one\\ndidn't know about in the background of their lives and minds.\\nliterature and art were deeply respected in the archer set, and mrs.\\narcher was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable\\nand cultivated society had been when it included such figures as\\nwashington irving, fitz-greene halleck and the poet of \\\"the culprit\\nfay.\\\" the most celebrated authors of that generation had been\\n\\\"gentlemen\\\"; perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had\\ngentlemanly sentiments, but their origin, their appearance, their hair,\\ntheir intimacy with the stage and the opera, made any old new york\\ncriterion inapplicable to them.\\n\\n\\\"when i was a girl,\\\" mrs. archer used to say, \\\"we knew everybody\\nbetween the battery and canal street; and only the people one knew had\\ncarriages.  it was perfectly easy to place any one then; now one can't\\ntell, and i prefer not to try.\\\"\\n\\nonly old catherine mingott, with her absence of moral prejudices and\\nalmost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions, might have\\nbridged the abyss; but she had never opened a book or looked at a\\npicture, and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala\\nnights at the italiens, in the days of her triumph at the tuileries.\\npossibly beaufort, who was her match in daring, would have succeeded in\\nbringing about a fusion; but his grand house and silk-stockinged\\nfootmen were an obstacle to informal sociability.  moreover, he was as\\nilliterate as old mrs. mingott, and considered \\\"fellows who wrote\\\" as\\nthe mere paid purveyors of rich men's pleasures; and no one rich enough\\nto influence his opinion had ever questioned it.\\n\\nnewland archer had been aware of these things ever since he could\\nremember, and had accepted them as part of the structure of his\\nuniverse.  he knew that there were societies where painters and poets\\nand novelists and men of science, and even great actors, were as sought\\nafter as dukes; he had often pictured to himself what it would have\\nbeen to live in the intimacy of drawing-rooms dominated by the talk of\\nmerimee (whose \\\"lettres a une inconnue\\\" was one of his inseparables),\\nof thackeray, browning or william morris.  but such things were\\ninconceivable in new york, and unsettling to think of.  archer knew\\nmost of the \\\"fellows who wrote,\\\" the musicians and the painters: he met\\nthem at the century, or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that\\nwere beginning to come into existence.  he enjoyed them there, and was\\nbored with them at the blenkers', where they were mingled with fervid\\nand dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities; and\\neven after his most exciting talks with ned winsett he always came away\\nwith the feeling that if his world was small, so was theirs, and that\\nthe only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where\\nthey would naturally merge.\\n\\nhe was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the\\ncountess olenska had lived and suffered, and also--perhaps--tasted\\nmysterious joys.  he remembered with what amusement she had told him\\nthat her grandmother mingott and the wellands objected to her living in\\na \\\"bohemian\\\" quarter given over to \\\"people who wrote.\\\"  it was not the\\nperil but the poverty that her family disliked; but that shade escaped\\nher, and she supposed they considered literature compromising.\\n\\nshe herself had no fears of it, and the books scattered about her\\ndrawing-room (a part of the house in which books were usually supposed\\nto be \\\"out of place\\\"), though chiefly works of fiction, had whetted\\narcher's interest with such new names as those of paul bourget,\\nhuysmans, and the goncourt brothers.  ruminating on these things as he\\napproached her door, he was once more conscious of the curious way in\\nwhich she reversed his values, and of the need of thinking himself into\\nconditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be\\nof use in her present difficulty.\\n\\n\\nnastasia opened the door, smiling mysteriously.  on the bench in the\\nhall lay a sable-lined overcoat, a folded opera hat of dull silk with a\\ngold j. b. on the lining, and a white silk muffler: there was no\\nmistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of\\njulius beaufort.\\n\\narcher was angry: so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his\\ncard and going away; then he remembered that in writing to madame\\nolenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he\\nwished to see her privately.  he had therefore no one but himself to\\nblame if she had opened her doors to other visitors; and he entered the\\ndrawing-room with the dogged determination to make beaufort feel\\nhimself in the way, and to outstay him.\\n\\nthe banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf, which was draped with\\nan old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church\\ncandles of yellowish wax.  he had thrust his chest out, supporting his\\nshoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large\\npatent-leather foot.  as archer entered he was smiling and looking down\\non his hostess, who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the\\nchimney.  a table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it, and\\nagainst the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as\\ntributes from the beaufort hot-houses, madame olenska sat\\nhalf-reclined, her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving\\nthe arm bare to the elbow.\\n\\nit was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were\\ncalled \\\"simple dinner dresses\\\": a close-fitting armour of whale-boned\\nsilk, slightly open in the neck, with lace ruffles filling in the\\ncrack, and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to\\nshow an etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band.  but madame olenska,\\nheedless of tradition, was attired in a long robe of red velvet\\nbordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur.\\narcher remembered, on his last visit to paris, seeing a portrait by the\\nnew painter, carolus duran, whose pictures were the sensation of the\\nsalon, in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath-like robes with\\nher chin nestling in fur.  there was something perverse and provocative\\nin the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing-room, and\\nin the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms; but the effect\\nwas undeniably pleasing.\\n\\n\\\"lord love us--three whole days at skuytercliff!\\\" beaufort was saying\\nin his loud sneering voice as archer entered.  \\\"you'd better take all\\nyour furs, and a hot-water-bottle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"why?  is the house so cold?\\\" she asked, holding out her left hand to\\narcher in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss\\nit.\\n\\n\\\"no; but the missus is,\\\" said beaufort, nodding carelessly to the young\\nman.\\n\\n\\\"but i thought her so kind.  she came herself to invite me. granny says\\ni must certainly go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"granny would, of course.  and i say it's a shame you're going to miss\\nthe little oyster supper i'd planned for you at delmonico's next\\nsunday, with campanini and scalchi and a lot of jolly people.\\\"\\n\\nshe looked doubtfully from the banker to archer.\\n\\n\\\"ah--that does tempt me!  except the other evening at mrs. struthers's\\ni've not met a single artist since i've been here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what kind of artists?  i know one or two painters, very good fellows,\\nthat i could bring to see you if you'd allow me,\\\" said archer boldly.\\n\\n\\\"painters?  are there painters in new york?\\\" asked beaufort, in a tone\\nimplying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures;\\nand madame olenska said to archer, with her grave smile:  \\\"that would\\nbe charming.  but i was really thinking of dramatic artists, singers,\\nactors, musicians.  my husband's house was always full of them.\\\"\\n\\nshe said the words \\\"my husband\\\" as if no sinister associations were\\nconnected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the\\nlost delights of her married life.  archer looked at her perplexedly,\\nwondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to\\ntouch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her\\nreputation in order to break with it.\\n\\n\\\"i do think,\\\" she went on, addressing both men, \\\"that the imprevu adds\\nto one's enjoyment.  it's perhaps a mistake to see the same people\\nevery day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's confoundedly dull, anyhow; new york is dying of dullness,\\\"\\nbeaufort grumbled.  \\\"and when i try to liven it up for you, you go back\\non me.  come--think better of it!  sunday is your last chance, for\\ncampanini leaves next week for baltimore and philadelphia; and i've a\\nprivate room, and a steinway, and they'll sing all night for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"how delicious!  may i think it over, and write to you tomorrow\\nmorning?\\\"\\n\\nshe spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice.\\nbeaufort evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood\\nstaring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"why not now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's too serious a question to decide at this late hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"do you call it late?\\\"\\n\\nshe returned his glance coolly.  \\\"yes; because i have still to talk\\nbusiness with mr. archer for a little while.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah,\\\" beaufort snapped.  there was no appeal from her tone, and with a\\nslight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed\\nwith a practised air, and calling out from the threshold:  \\\"i say,\\nnewland, if you can persuade the countess to stop in town of course\\nyou're included in the supper,\\\" left the room with his heavy important\\nstep.\\n\\nfor a moment archer fancied that mr. letterblair must have told her of\\nhis coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his\\nmind.\\n\\n\\\"you know painters, then?  you live in their milieu?\\\" she asked, her\\neyes full of interest.\\n\\n\\\"oh, not exactly.  i don't know that the arts have a milieu here, any\\nof them; they're more like a very thinly settled outskirt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but you care for such things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"immensely.  when i'm in paris or london i never miss an exhibition.  i\\ntry to keep up.\\\"\\n\\nshe looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from\\nher long draperies.\\n\\n\\\"i used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things.  but\\nnow i want to try not to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you want to try not to?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes: i want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody\\nelse here.\\\"\\n\\narcher reddened.  \\\"you'll never be like everybody else,\\\" he said.\\n\\nshe raised her straight eyebrows a little.  \\\"ah, don't say that.  if\\nyou knew how i hate to be different!\\\"\\n\\nher face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask.  she leaned forward,\\nclasping her knee in her thin hands, and looking away from him into\\nremote dark distances.\\n\\n\\\"i want to get away from it all,\\\" she insisted.\\n\\nhe waited a moment and cleared his throat.  \\\"i know.  mr. letterblair\\nhas told me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"that's the reason i've come.  he asked me to--you see i'm in the firm.\\\"\\n\\nshe looked slightly surprised, and then her eyes brightened.  \\\"you mean\\nyou can manage it for me?  i can talk to you instead of mr.\\nletterblair?  oh, that will be so much easier!\\\"\\n\\nher tone touched him, and his confidence grew with his\\nself-satisfaction.  he perceived that she had spoken of business to\\nbeaufort simply to get rid of him; and to have routed beaufort was\\nsomething of a triumph.\\n\\n\\\"i am here to talk about it,\\\" he repeated.\\n\\nshe sat silent, her head still propped by the arm that rested on the\\nback of the sofa.  her face looked pale and extinguished, as if dimmed\\nby the rich red of her dress.  she struck archer, of a sudden, as a\\npathetic and even pitiful figure.\\n\\n\\\"now we're coming to hard facts,\\\" he thought, conscious in himself of\\nthe same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his\\nmother and her contemporaries.  how little practice he had had in\\ndealing with unusual situations!  their very vocabulary was unfamiliar\\nto him, and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage.  in face of what\\nwas coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy.\\n\\nafter a pause madame olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence:  \\\"i\\nwant to be free; i want to wipe out all the past.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i understand that.\\\"\\n\\nher face warmed.  \\\"then you'll help me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"first--\\\" he hesitated--\\\"perhaps i ought to know a little more.\\\"\\n\\nshe seemed surprised.  \\\"you know about my husband--my life with him?\\\"\\n\\nhe made a sign of assent.\\n\\n\\\"well--then--what more is there?  in this country are such things\\ntolerated?  i'm a protestant--our church does not forbid divorce in\\nsuch cases.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"certainly not.\\\"\\n\\nthey were both silent again, and archer felt the spectre of count\\nolenski's letter grimacing hideously between them.  the letter filled\\nonly half a page, and was just what he had described it to be in\\nspeaking of it to mr. letterblair: the vague charge of an angry\\nblackguard.  but how much truth was behind it?  only count olenski's\\nwife could tell.\\n\\n\\\"i've looked through the papers you gave to mr. letterblair,\\\" he said\\nat length.\\n\\n\\\"well--can there be anything more abominable?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no.\\\"\\n\\nshe changed her position slightly, screening her eyes with her lifted\\nhand.\\n\\n\\\"of course you know,\\\" archer continued, \\\"that if your husband chooses\\nto fight the case--as he threatens to--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"he can say things--things that might be unpl--might be disagreeable to\\nyou: say them publicly, so that they would get about, and harm you even\\nif--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"if--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i mean: no matter how unfounded they were.\\\"\\n\\nshe paused for a long interval; so long that, not wishing to keep his\\neyes on her shaded face, he had time to imprint on his mind the exact\\nshape of her other hand, the one on her knee, and every detail of the\\nthree rings on her fourth and fifth fingers; among which, he noticed, a\\nwedding ring did not appear.\\n\\n\\\"what harm could such accusations, even if he made them publicly, do me\\nhere?\\\"\\n\\nit was on his lips to exclaim:  \\\"my poor child--far more harm than\\nanywhere else!\\\"  instead, he answered, in a voice that sounded in his\\nears like mr. letterblair's: \\\"new york society is a very small world\\ncompared with the one you've lived in.  and it's ruled, in spite of\\nappearances, by a few people with--well, rather old-fashioned ideas.\\\"\\n\\nshe said nothing, and he continued:  \\\"our ideas about marriage and\\ndivorce are particularly old-fashioned.  our legislation favours\\ndivorce--our social customs don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"never?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--not if the woman, however injured, however irreproachable, has\\nappearances in the least degree against her, has exposed herself by any\\nunconventional action to--to offensive insinuations--\\\"\\n\\nshe drooped her head a little lower, and he waited again, intensely\\nhoping for a flash of indignation, or at least a brief cry of denial.\\nnone came.\\n\\na little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow, and a log\\nbroke in two and sent up a shower of sparks.  the whole hushed and\\nbrooding room seemed to be waiting silently with archer.\\n\\n\\\"yes,\\\" she murmured at length, \\\"that's what my family tell me.\\\"\\n\\nhe winced a little.  \\\"it's not unnatural--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"our family,\\\" she corrected herself; and archer coloured.  \\\"for you'll\\nbe my cousin soon,\\\" she continued gently.\\n\\n\\\"i hope so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and you take their view?\\\"\\n\\nhe stood up at this, wandered across the room, stared with void eyes at\\none of the pictures against the old red damask, and came back\\nirresolutely to her side.  how could he say:  \\\"yes, if what your\\nhusband hints is true, or if you've no way of disproving it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"sincerely--\\\" she interjected, as he was about to speak.\\n\\nhe looked down into the fire.  \\\"sincerely, then--what should you gain\\nthat would compensate for the possibility--the certainty--of a lot of\\nbeastly talk?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but my freedom--is that nothing?\\\"\\n\\nit flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was\\ntrue, and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt.  how was he\\nto tell her that, if she really cherished such a plan, the laws of the\\nstate were inexorably opposed to it?  the mere suspicion that the\\nthought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward\\nher.  \\\"but aren't you as free as air as it is?\\\" he returned.  \\\"who can\\ntouch you?  mr. letterblair tells me the financial question has been\\nsettled--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, yes,\\\" she said indifferently.\\n\\n\\\"well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely\\ndisagreeable and painful?  think of the newspapers--their vileness!\\nit's all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can't make over society.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no,\\\" she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he\\nfelt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts.\\n\\n\\\"the individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is\\nsupposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention\\nthat keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are\\nany,\\\" he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his\\nlips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her\\nsilence seemed to have laid bare.  since she would not or could not say\\nthe one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let\\nher feel that he was trying to probe into her secret.  better keep on\\nthe surface, in the prudent old new york way, than risk uncovering a\\nwound he could not heal.\\n\\n\\\"it's my business, you know,\\\" he went on, \\\"to help you to see these\\nthings as the people who are fondest of you see them.  the mingotts,\\nthe wellands, the van der luydens, all your friends and relations: if i\\ndidn't show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn't be\\nfair of me, would it?\\\"  he spoke insistently, almost pleading with her\\nin his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence.\\n\\nshe said slowly:  \\\"no; it wouldn't be fair.\\\"\\n\\nthe fire had crumbled down to greyness, and one of the lamps made a\\ngurgling appeal for attention.  madame olenska rose, wound it up and\\nreturned to the fire, but without resuming her seat.\\n\\nher remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more\\nfor either of them to say, and archer stood up also.\\n\\n\\\"very well; i will do what you wish,\\\" she said abruptly.  the blood\\nrushed to his forehead; and, taken aback by the suddenness of her\\nsurrender, he caught her two hands awkwardly in his.\\n\\n\\\"i--i do want to help you,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"you do help me.  good night, my cousin.\\\"\\n\\nhe bent and laid his lips on her hands, which were cold and lifeless.\\nshe drew them away, and he turned to the door, found his coat and hat\\nunder the faint gas-light of the hall, and plunged out into the winter\\nnight bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was a crowded night at wallack's theatre.\\n\\nthe play was \\\"the shaughraun,\\\" with dion boucicault in the title role\\nand harry montague and ada dyas as the lovers.  the popularity of the\\nadmirable english company was at its height, and the shaughraun always\\npacked the house.  in the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved; in\\nthe stalls and boxes, people smiled a little at the hackneyed\\nsentiments and clap-trap situations, and enjoyed the play as much as\\nthe galleries did.\\n\\nthere was one episode, in particular, that held the house from floor to\\nceiling.  it was that in which harry montague, after a sad, almost\\nmonosyllabic scene of parting with miss dyas, bade her good-bye, and\\nturned to go.  the actress, who was standing near the mantelpiece and\\nlooking down into the fire, wore a gray cashmere dress without\\nfashionable loopings or trimmings, moulded to her tall figure and\\nflowing in long lines about her feet.  around her neck was a narrow\\nblack velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back.\\n\\nwhen her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the\\nmantel-shelf and bowed her face in her hands.  on the threshold he\\npaused to look at her; then he stole back, lifted one of the ends of\\nvelvet ribbon, kissed it, and left the room without her hearing him or\\nchanging her attitude.  and on this silent parting the curtain fell.\\n\\nit was always for the sake of that particular scene that newland archer\\nwent to see \\\"the shaughraun.\\\" he thought the adieux of montague and ada\\ndyas as fine as anything he had ever seen croisette and bressant do in\\nparis, or madge robertson and kendal in london; in its reticence, its\\ndumb sorrow, it moved him more than the most famous histrionic\\noutpourings.\\n\\non the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy\\nby reminding him--he could not have said why--of his leave-taking from\\nmadame olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier.\\n\\nit would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the\\ntwo situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned.\\nnewland archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young\\nenglish actor's romantic good looks, and miss dyas was a tall\\nred-haired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly\\nface was utterly unlike ellen olenska's vivid countenance.  nor were\\narcher and madame olenska two lovers parting in heart-broken silence;\\nthey were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the\\nlawyer the worst possible impression of the client's case.  wherein,\\nthen, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a\\nkind of retrospective excitement?  it seemed to be in madame olenska's\\nmysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities\\noutside the daily run of experience.  she had hardly ever said a word\\nto him to produce this impression, but it was a part of her, either a\\nprojection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something\\ninherently dramatic, passionate and unusual in herself.  archer had\\nalways been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a\\nsmall part in shaping people's lots compared with their innate tendency\\nto have things happen to them.  this tendency he had felt from the\\nfirst in madame olenska.  the quiet, almost passive young woman struck\\nhim as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen,\\nno matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to\\navoid them.  the exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so\\nthick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently\\npassed unperceived.  it was precisely the odd absence of surprise in\\nher that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very\\nmaelstrom: the things she took for granted gave the measure of those\\nshe had rebelled against.\\n\\narcher had left her with the conviction that count olenski's accusation\\nwas not unfounded.  the mysterious person who figured in his wife's\\npast as \\\"the secretary\\\" had probably not been unrewarded for his share\\nin her escape.  the conditions from which she had fled were\\nintolerable, past speaking of, past believing: she was young, she was\\nfrightened, she was desperate--what more natural than that she should\\nbe grateful to her rescuer?  the pity was that her gratitude put her,\\nin the law's eyes and the world's, on a par with her abominable\\nhusband.  archer had made her understand this, as he was bound to do;\\nhe had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly new york, on\\nwhose larger charity she had apparently counted, was precisely the\\nplace where she could least hope for indulgence.\\n\\nto have to make this fact plain to her--and to witness her resigned\\nacceptance of it--had been intolerably painful to him.  he felt himself\\ndrawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity, as if her\\ndumbly-confessed error had put her at his mercy, humbling yet endearing\\nher.  he was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret, rather\\nthan to the cold scrutiny of mr. letterblair, or the embarrassed gaze\\nof her family.  he immediately took it upon himself to assure them both\\nthat she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce, basing her\\ndecision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the\\nproceeding; and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes\\nfrom the \\\"unpleasantness\\\" she had spared them.\\n\\n\\\"i was sure newland would manage it,\\\" mrs. welland had said proudly of\\nher future son-in-law; and old mrs. mingott, who had summoned him for a\\nconfidential interview, had congratulated him on his cleverness, and\\nadded impatiently:  \\\"silly goose!  i told her myself what nonsense it\\nwas.  wanting to pass herself off as ellen mingott and an old maid,\\nwhen she has the luck to be a married woman and a countess!\\\"\\n\\nthese incidents had made the memory of his last talk with madame\\nolenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the\\nparting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears, and he stood up\\nto leave the theatre.\\n\\nin doing so, he turned to the side of the house behind him, and saw the\\nlady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the beauforts,\\nlawrence lefferts and one or two other men.  he had not spoken with her\\nalone since their evening together, and had tried to avoid being with\\nher in company; but now their eyes met, and as mrs. beaufort recognised\\nhim at the same time, and made her languid little gesture of\\ninvitation, it was impossible not to go into the box.\\n\\nbeaufort and lefferts made way for him, and after a few words with mrs.\\nbeaufort, who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk,\\narcher seated himself behind madame olenska.  there was no one else in\\nthe box but mr. sillerton jackson, who was telling mrs. beaufort in a\\nconfidential undertone about mrs. lemuel struthers's last sunday\\nreception (where some people reported that there had been dancing).\\nunder cover of this circumstantial narrative, to which mrs. beaufort\\nlistened with her perfect smile, and her head at just the right angle\\nto be seen in profile from the stalls, madame olenska turned and spoke\\nin a low voice.\\n\\n\\\"do you think,\\\" she asked, glancing toward the stage, \\\"he will send her\\na bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning?\\\"\\n\\narcher reddened, and his heart gave a leap of surprise.  he had called\\nonly twice on madame olenska, and each time he had sent her a box of\\nyellow roses, and each time without a card.  she had never before made\\nany allusion to the flowers, and he supposed she had never thought of\\nhim as the sender.  now her sudden recognition of the gift, and her\\nassociating it with the tender leave-taking on the stage, filled him\\nwith an agitated pleasure.\\n\\n\\\"i was thinking of that too--i was going to leave the theatre in order\\nto take the picture away with me,\\\" he said.\\n\\nto his surprise her colour rose, reluctantly and duskily.  she looked\\ndown at the mother-of-pearl opera-glass in her smoothly gloved hands,\\nand said, after a pause: \\\"what do you do while may is away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i stick to my work,\\\" he answered, faintly annoyed by the question.\\n\\nin obedience to a long-established habit, the wellands had left the\\nprevious week for st. augustine, where, out of regard for the supposed\\nsusceptibility of mr. welland's bronchial tubes, they always spent the\\nlatter part of the winter.  mr. welland was a mild and silent man, with\\nno opinions but with many habits.  with these habits none might\\ninterfere; and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should\\nalways go with him on his annual journey to the south.  to preserve an\\nunbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind; he would not\\nhave known where his hair-brushes were, or how to provide stamps for\\nhis letters, if mrs. welland had not been there to tell him.\\n\\nas all the members of the family adored each other, and as mr. welland\\nwas the central object of their idolatry, it never occurred to his wife\\nand may to let him go to st. augustine alone; and his sons, who were\\nboth in the law, and could not leave new york during the winter, always\\njoined him for easter and travelled back with him.\\n\\nit was impossible for archer to discuss the necessity of may's\\naccompanying her father.  the reputation of the mingotts' family\\nphysician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which mr.\\nwelland had never had; and his insistence on st. augustine was\\ntherefore inflexible.  originally, it had been intended that may's\\nengagement should not be announced till her return from florida, and\\nthe fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to\\nalter mr. welland's plans.  archer would have liked to join the\\ntravellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his\\nbetrothed; but he too was bound by custom and conventions.  little\\narduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted\\nof frivolity by the whole mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a\\nholiday in mid-winter; and he accepted may's departure with the\\nresignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal\\nconstituents of married life.\\n\\nhe was conscious that madame olenska was looking at him under lowered\\nlids.  \\\"i have done what you wished--what you advised,\\\" she said\\nabruptly.\\n\\n\\\"ah--i'm glad,\\\" he returned, embarrassed by her broaching the subject\\nat such a moment.\\n\\n\\\"i understand--that you were right,\\\" she went on a little breathlessly;\\n\\\"but sometimes life is difficult ...  perplexing...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and i wanted to tell you that i do feel you were right; and that i'm\\ngrateful to you,\\\" she ended, lifting her opera-glass quickly to her\\neyes as the door of the box opened and beaufort's resonant voice broke\\nin on them.\\n\\narcher stood up, and left the box and the theatre.\\n\\nonly the day before he had received a letter from may welland in which,\\nwith characteristic candour, she had asked him to \\\"be kind to ellen\\\" in\\ntheir absence.  \\\"she likes you and admires you so much--and you know,\\nthough she doesn't show it, she's still very lonely and unhappy.  i\\ndon't think granny understands her, or uncle lovell mingott either;\\nthey really think she's much worldlier and fonder of society than she\\nis.  and i can quite see that new york must seem dull to her, though\\nthe family won't admit it.  i think she's been used to lots of things\\nwe haven't got; wonderful music, and picture shows, and\\ncelebrities--artists and authors and all the clever people you admire.\\ngranny can't understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and\\nclothes--but i can see that you're almost the only person in new york\\nwho can talk to her about what she really cares for.\\\"\\n\\nhis wise may--how he had loved her for that letter!  but he had not\\nmeant to act on it; he was too busy, to begin with, and he did not\\ncare, as an engaged man, to play too conspicuously the part of madame\\nolenska's champion.  he had an idea that she knew how to take care of\\nherself a good deal better than the ingenuous may imagined.  she had\\nbeaufort at her feet, mr. van der luyden hovering above her like a\\nprotecting deity, and any number of candidates (lawrence lefferts among\\nthem) waiting their opportunity in the middle distance.  yet he never\\nsaw her, or exchanged a word with her, without feeling that, after all,\\nmay's ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination.  ellen\\nolenska was lonely and she was unhappy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas he came out into the lobby archer ran across his friend ned winsett,\\nthe only one among what janey called his \\\"clever people\\\" with whom he\\ncared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of\\nclub and chop-house banter.\\n\\nhe had caught sight, across the house, of winsett's shabby\\nround-shouldered back, and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the\\nbeaufort box.  the two men shook hands, and winsett proposed a bock at\\na little german restaurant around the corner.  archer, who was not in\\nthe mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there, declined\\non the plea that he had work to do at home; and winsett said:  \\\"oh,\\nwell so have i for that matter, and i'll be the industrious apprentice\\ntoo.\\\"\\n\\nthey strolled along together, and presently winsett said:  \\\"look here,\\nwhat i'm really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of\\nyours--with the beauforts, wasn't she?  the one your friend lefferts\\nseems so smitten by.\\\"\\n\\narcher, he could not have said why, was slightly annoyed.  what the\\ndevil did ned winsett want with ellen olenska's name?  and above all,\\nwhy did he couple it with lefferts's?  it was unlike winsett to\\nmanifest such curiosity; but after all, archer remembered, he was a\\njournalist.\\n\\n\\\"it's not for an interview, i hope?\\\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\\"well--not for the press; just for myself,\\\" winsett rejoined.  \\\"the\\nfact is she's a neighbour of mine--queer quarter for such a beauty to\\nsettle in--and she's been awfully kind to my little boy, who fell down\\nher area chasing his kitten, and gave himself a nasty cut.  she rushed\\nin bareheaded, carrying him in her arms, with his knee all beautifully\\nbandaged, and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too\\ndazzled to ask her name.\\\"\\n\\na pleasant glow dilated archer's heart.  there was nothing\\nextraordinary in the tale: any woman would have done as much for a\\nneighbour's child.  but it was just like ellen, he felt, to have rushed\\nin bareheaded, carrying the boy in her arms, and to have dazzled poor\\nmrs. winsett into forgetting to ask who she was.\\n\\n\\\"that is the countess olenska--a granddaughter of old mrs. mingott's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"whew--a countess!\\\" whistled ned winsett.  \\\"well, i didn't know\\ncountesses were so neighbourly.  mingotts ain't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"they would be, if you'd let them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, well--\\\"  it was their old interminable argument as to the\\nobstinate unwillingness of the \\\"clever people\\\" to frequent the\\nfashionable, and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it.\\n\\n\\\"i wonder,\\\" winsett broke off, \\\"how a countess happens to live in our\\nslum?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"because she doesn't care a hang about where she lives--or about any of\\nour little social sign-posts,\\\" said archer, with a secret pride in his\\nown picture of her.\\n\\n\\\"h'm--been in bigger places, i suppose,\\\" the other commented.  \\\"well,\\nhere's my corner.\\\"\\n\\nhe slouched off across broadway, and archer stood looking after him and\\nmusing on his last words.\\n\\nned winsett had those flashes of penetration; they were the most\\ninteresting thing about him, and always made archer wonder why they had\\nallowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are\\nstill struggling.\\n\\narcher had known that winsett had a wife and child, but he had never\\nseen them.  the two men always met at the century, or at some haunt of\\njournalists and theatrical people, such as the restaurant where winsett\\nhad proposed to go for a bock.  he had given archer to understand that\\nhis wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might\\nmerely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes,\\nor in both.  winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social\\nobservances: archer, who dressed in the evening because he thought it\\ncleaner and more comfortable to do so, and who had never stopped to\\nconsider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in\\na modest budget, regarded winsett's attitude as part of the boring\\n\\\"bohemian\\\" pose that always made fashionable people, who changed their\\nclothes without talking about it, and were not forever harping on the\\nnumber of servants one kept, seem so much simpler and less\\nself-conscious than the others.  nevertheless, he was always stimulated\\nby winsett, and whenever he caught sight of the journalist's lean\\nbearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner\\nand carry him off for a long talk.\\n\\nwinsett was not a journalist by choice.  he was a pure man of letters,\\nuntimely born in a world that had no need of letters; but after\\npublishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations, of\\nwhich one hundred and twenty copies were sold, thirty given away, and\\nthe balance eventually destroyed by the publishers (as per contract) to\\nmake room for more marketable material, he had abandoned his real\\ncalling, and taken a sub-editorial job on a women's weekly, where\\nfashion-plates and paper patterns alternated with new england\\nlove-stories and advertisements of temperance drinks.\\n\\non the subject of \\\"hearth-fires\\\" (as the paper was called) he was\\ninexhaustibly entertaining; but beneath his fun lurked the sterile\\nbitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up.  his\\nconversation always made archer take the measure of his own life, and\\nfeel how little it contained; but winsett's, after all, contained still\\nless, and though their common fund of intellectual interests and\\ncuriosities made their talks exhilarating, their exchange of views\\nusually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism.\\n\\n\\\"the fact is, life isn't much a fit for either of us,\\\" winsett had once\\nsaid.  \\\"i'm down and out; nothing to be done about it.  i've got only\\none ware to produce, and there's no market for it here, and won't be in\\nmy time.  but you're free and you're well-off.  why don't you get into\\ntouch?  there's only one way to do it: to go into politics.\\\"\\n\\narcher threw his head back and laughed.  there one saw at a flash the\\nunbridgeable difference between men like winsett and the\\nothers--archer's kind.  every one in polite circles knew that, in\\namerica, \\\"a gentleman couldn't go into politics.\\\"  but, since he could\\nhardly put it in that way to winsett, he answered evasively: \\\"look at\\nthe career of the honest man in american politics!  they don't want us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"who's 'they'?  why don't you all get together and be 'they'\\nyourselves?\\\"\\n\\narcher's laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile.\\nit was useless to prolong the discussion: everybody knew the melancholy\\nfate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal\\nor state politics in new york.  the day was past when that sort of\\nthing was possible: the country was in possession of the bosses and the\\nemigrant, and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture.\\n\\n\\\"culture!  yes--if we had it!  but there are just a few little local\\npatches, dying out here and there for lack of--well, hoeing and\\ncross-fertilising: the last remnants of the old european tradition that\\nyour forebears brought with them.  but you're in a pitiful little\\nminority: you've got no centre, no competition, no audience.  you're\\nlike the pictures on the walls of a deserted house:  'the portrait of a\\ngentleman.'  you'll never amount to anything, any of you, till you roll\\nup your sleeves and get right down into the muck.  that, or emigrate\\n... god!  if i could emigrate ...\\\"\\n\\narcher mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back\\nto books, where winsett, if uncertain, was always interesting.\\nemigrate!  as if a gentleman could abandon his own country!  one could\\nno more do that than one could roll up one's sleeves and go down into\\nthe muck.  a gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained.  but you\\ncouldn't make a man like winsett see that; and that was why the new\\nyork of literary clubs and exotic restaurants, though a first shake\\nmade it seem more of a kaleidoscope, turned out, in the end, to be a\\nsmaller box, with a more monotonous pattern, than the assembled atoms\\nof fifth avenue.\\n\\n\\nthe next morning archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses.\\nin consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived\\nthat his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was\\nfilled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.\\nwhy should he not be, at that moment, on the sands of st. augustine\\nwith may welland?  no one was deceived by his pretense of professional\\nactivity.  in old-fashioned legal firms like that of which mr.\\nletterblair was the head, and which were mainly engaged in the\\nmanagement of large estates and \\\"conservative\\\" investments, there were\\nalways two or three young men, fairly well-off, and without\\nprofessional ambition, who, for a certain number of hours of each day,\\nsat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks, or simply reading the\\nnewspapers.  though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an\\noccupation, the crude fact of money-making was still regarded as\\nderogatory, and the law, being a profession, was accounted a more\\ngentlemanly pursuit than business.  but none of these young men had\\nmuch hope of really advancing in his profession, or any earnest desire\\nto do so; and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was\\nalready perceptibly spreading.\\n\\nit made archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too.\\nhe had, to be sure, other tastes and interests; he spent his vacations\\nin european travel, cultivated the \\\"clever people\\\" may spoke of, and\\ngenerally tried to \\\"keep up,\\\" as he had somewhat wistfully put it to\\nmadame olenska.  but once he was married, what would become of this\\nnarrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?  he had\\nseen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream, though\\nperhaps less ardently, and who had gradually sunk into the placid and\\nluxurious routine of their elders.\\n\\nfrom the office he sent a note by messenger to madame olenska, asking\\nif he might call that afternoon, and begging her to let him find a\\nreply at his club; but at the club he found nothing, nor did he receive\\nany letter the following day.  this unexpected silence mortified him\\nbeyond reason, and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of\\nyellow roses behind a florist's window-pane, he left it there.  it was\\nonly on the third morning that he received a line by post from the\\ncountess olenska.  to his surprise it was dated from skuytercliff,\\nwhither the van der luydens had promptly retreated after putting the\\nduke on board his steamer.\\n\\n\\\"i ran away,\\\" the writer began abruptly (without the usual\\npreliminaries), \\\"the day after i saw you at the play, and these kind\\nfriends have taken me in.  i wanted to be quiet, and think things over.\\nyou were right in telling me how kind they were; i feel myself so safe\\nhere.  i wish that you were with us.\\\"  she ended with a conventional\\n\\\"yours sincerely,\\\" and without any allusion to the date of her return.\\n\\nthe tone of the note surprised the young man.  what was madame olenska\\nrunning away from, and why did she feel the need to be safe?  his first\\nthought was of some dark menace from abroad; then he reflected that he\\ndid not know her epistolary style, and that it might run to picturesque\\nexaggeration.  women always exaggerated; and moreover she was not\\nwholly at her ease in english, which she often spoke as if she were\\ntranslating from the french.  \\\"je me suis evadee--\\\" put in that way,\\nthe opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have\\nwanted to escape from a boring round of engagements; which was very\\nlikely true, for he judged her to be capricious, and easily wearied of\\nthe pleasure of the moment.\\n\\nit amused him to think of the van der luydens' having carried her off\\nto skuytercliff on a second visit, and this time for an indefinite\\nperiod.  the doors of skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to\\nvisitors, and a chilly week-end was the most ever offered to the few\\nthus privileged.  but archer had seen, on his last visit to paris, the\\ndelicious play of labiche, \\\"le voyage de m. perrichon,\\\" and he\\nremembered m.  perrichon's dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the\\nyoung man whom he had pulled out of the glacier.  the van der luydens\\nhad rescued madame olenska from a doom almost as icy; and though there\\nwere many other reasons for being attracted to her, archer knew that\\nbeneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on\\nrescuing her.\\n\\nhe felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away; and\\nalmost immediately remembered that, only the day before, he had refused\\nan invitation to spend the following sunday with the reggie chiverses\\nat their house on the hudson, a few miles below skuytercliff.\\n\\nhe had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at highbank,\\nwith coasting, ice-boating, sleighing, long tramps in the snow, and a\\ngeneral flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes.  he had\\njust received a box of new books from his london book-seller, and had\\npreferred the prospect of a quiet sunday at home with his spoils.  but\\nhe now went into the club writing-room, wrote a hurried telegram, and\\ntold the servant to send it immediately.  he knew that mrs. reggie\\ndidn't object to her visitors' suddenly changing their minds, and that\\nthere was always a room to spare in her elastic house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnewland archer arrived at the chiverses' on friday evening, and on\\nsaturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a\\nweek-end at highbank.\\n\\nin the morning he had a spin in the ice-boat with his hostess and a few\\nof the hardier guests; in the afternoon he \\\"went over the farm\\\" with\\nreggie, and listened, in the elaborately appointed stables, to long and\\nimpressive disquisitions on the horse; after tea he talked in a corner\\nof the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself\\nbroken-hearted when his engagement was announced, but was now eager to\\ntell him of her own matrimonial hopes; and finally, about midnight, he\\nassisted in putting a gold-fish in one visitor's bed, dressed up a\\nburglar in the bath-room of a nervous aunt, and saw in the small hours\\nby joining in a pillow-fight that ranged from the nurseries to the\\nbasement.  but on sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter, and drove\\nover to skuytercliff.\\n\\npeople had always been told that the house at skuytercliff was an\\nitalian villa.  those who had never been to italy believed it; so did\\nsome who had.  the house had been built by mr. van der luyden in his\\nyouth, on his return from the \\\"grand tour,\\\" and in anticipation of his\\napproaching marriage with miss louisa dagonet.  it was a large square\\nwooden structure, with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and\\nwhite, a corinthian portico, and fluted pilasters between the windows.\\nfrom the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by\\nbalustrades and urns descended in the steel-engraving style to a small\\nirregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers.\\nto the right and left, the famous weedless lawns studded with\\n\\\"specimen\\\" trees (each of a different variety) rolled away to long\\nranges of grass crested with elaborate cast-iron ornaments; and below,\\nin a hollow, lay the four-roomed stone house which the first patroon\\nhad built on the land granted him in 1612.\\n\\nagainst the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the\\nitalian villa loomed up rather grimly; even in summer it kept its\\ndistance, and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than\\nthirty feet from its awful front.  now, as archer rang the bell, the\\nlong tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum; and the surprise of the\\nbutler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he\\nhad been summoned from his final sleep.\\n\\nhappily archer was of the family, and therefore, irregular though his\\narrival was, entitled to be informed that the countess olenska was out,\\nhaving driven to afternoon service with mrs. van der luyden exactly\\nthree quarters of an hour earlier.\\n\\n\\\"mr. van der luyden,\\\" the butler continued, \\\"is in, sir; but my\\nimpression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading\\nyesterday's evening post.  i heard him say, sir, on his return from\\nchurch this morning, that he intended to look through the evening post\\nafter luncheon; if you like, sir, i might go to the library door and\\nlisten--\\\"\\n\\nbut archer, thanking him, said that he would go and meet the ladies;\\nand the butler, obviously relieved, closed the door on him majestically.\\n\\na groom took the cutter to the stables, and archer struck through the\\npark to the high-road.  the village of skuytercliff was only a mile and\\na half away, but he knew that mrs. van der luyden never walked, and\\nthat he must keep to the road to meet the carriage.  presently,\\nhowever, coming down a foot-path that crossed the highway, he caught\\nsight of a slight figure in a red cloak, with a big dog running ahead.\\nhe hurried forward, and madame olenska stopped short with a smile of\\nwelcome.\\n\\n\\\"ah, you've come!\\\" she said, and drew her hand from her muff.\\n\\nthe red cloak made her look gay and vivid, like the ellen mingott of\\nold days; and he laughed as he took her hand, and answered:  \\\"i came to\\nsee what you were running away from.\\\"\\n\\nher face clouded over, but she answered:  \\\"ah, well--you will see,\\npresently.\\\"\\n\\nthe answer puzzled him.  \\\"why--do you mean that you've been overtaken?\\\"\\n\\nshe shrugged her shoulders, with a little movement like nastasia's, and\\nrejoined in a lighter tone:  \\\"shall we walk on?  i'm so cold after the\\nsermon.  and what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?\\\"\\n\\nthe blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak.\\n\\\"ellen--what is it?  you must tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, presently--let's run a race first: my feet are freezing to the\\nground,\\\" she cried; and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the\\nsnow, the dog leaping about her with challenging barks.  for a moment\\narcher stood watching, his gaze delighted by the flash of the red\\nmeteor against the snow; then he started after her, and they met,\\npanting and laughing, at a wicket that led into the park.\\n\\nshe looked up at him and smiled.  \\\"i knew you'd come!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"that shows you wanted me to,\\\" he returned, with a disproportionate joy\\nin their nonsense.  the white glitter of the trees filled the air with\\nits own mysterious brightness, and as they walked on over the snow the\\nground seemed to sing under their feet.\\n\\n\\\"where did you come from?\\\" madame olenska asked.\\n\\nhe told her, and added:  \\\"it was because i got your note.\\\"\\n\\nafter a pause she said, with a just perceptible chill in her voice:\\n\\\"may asked you to take care of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i didn't need any asking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you mean--i'm so evidently helpless and defenceless?  what a poor\\nthing you must all think me!  but women here seem not--seem never to\\nfeel the need: any more than the blessed in heaven.\\\"\\n\\nhe lowered his voice to ask:  \\\"what sort of a need?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, don't ask me!  i don't speak your language,\\\" she retorted\\npetulantly.\\n\\nthe answer smote him like a blow, and he stood still in the path,\\nlooking down at her.\\n\\n\\\"what did i come for, if i don't speak yours?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, my friend--!\\\"  she laid her hand lightly on his arm, and he\\npleaded earnestly:  \\\"ellen--why won't you tell me what's happened?\\\"\\n\\nshe shrugged again.  \\\"does anything ever happen in heaven?\\\"\\n\\nhe was silent, and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a\\nword.  finally she said:  \\\"i will tell you--but where, where, where?\\none can't be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house, with\\nall the doors wide open, and always a servant bringing tea, or a log\\nfor the fire, or the newspaper!  is there nowhere in an american house\\nwhere one may be by one's self?  you're so shy, and yet you're so\\npublic.  i always feel as if i were in the convent again--or on the\\nstage, before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, you don't like us!\\\" archer exclaimed.\\n\\nthey were walking past the house of the old patroon, with its squat\\nwalls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central\\nchimney.  the shutters stood wide, and through one of the newly-washed\\nwindows archer caught the light of a fire.\\n\\n\\\"why--the house is open!\\\" he said.\\n\\nshe stood still.  \\\"no; only for today, at least.  i wanted to see it,\\nand mr. van der luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened, so that\\nwe might stop there on the way back from church this morning.\\\"  she ran\\nup the steps and tried the door.  \\\"it's still unlocked--what luck!\\ncome in and we can have a quiet talk.  mrs. van der luyden has driven\\nover to see her old aunts at rhinebeck and we shan't be missed at the\\nhouse for another hour.\\\"\\n\\nhe followed her into the narrow passage.  his spirits, which had\\ndropped at her last words, rose with an irrational leap.  the homely\\nlittle house stood there, its panels and brasses shining in the\\nfirelight, as if magically created to receive them.  a big bed of\\nembers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney, under an iron pot hung\\nfrom an ancient crane.  rush-bottomed arm-chairs faced each other\\nacross the tiled hearth, and rows of delft plates stood on shelves\\nagainst the walls.  archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers.\\n\\nmadame olenska, dropping her cloak, sat down in one of the chairs.\\narcher leaned against the chimney and looked at her.\\n\\n\\\"you're laughing now; but when you wrote me you were unhappy,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"  she paused.  \\\"but i can't feel unhappy when you're here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i sha'n't be here long,\\\" he rejoined, his lips stiffening with the\\neffort to say just so much and no more.\\n\\n\\\"no; i know.  but i'm improvident: i live in the moment when i'm happy.\\\"\\n\\nthe words stole through him like a temptation, and to close his senses\\nto it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black\\ntree-boles against the snow.  but it was as if she too had shifted her\\nplace, and he still saw her, between himself and the trees, drooping\\nover the fire with her indolent smile.  archer's heart was beating\\ninsubordinately.  what if it were from him that she had been running\\naway, and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone\\ntogether in this secret room?\\n\\n\\\"ellen, if i'm really a help to you--if you really wanted me to\\ncome--tell me what's wrong, tell me what it is you're running away\\nfrom,\\\" he insisted.\\n\\nhe spoke without shifting his position, without even turning to look at\\nher: if the thing was to happen, it was to happen in this way, with the\\nwhole width of the room between them, and his eyes still fixed on the\\nouter snow.\\n\\nfor a long moment she was silent; and in that moment archer imagined\\nher, almost heard her, stealing up behind him to throw her light arms\\nabout his neck.  while he waited, soul and body throbbing with the\\nmiracle to come, his eyes mechanically received the image of a\\nheavily-coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing\\nalong the path to the house.  the man was julius beaufort.\\n\\n\\\"ah--!\\\" archer cried, bursting into a laugh.\\n\\nmadame olenska had sprung up and moved to his side, slipping her hand\\ninto his; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she\\nshrank back.\\n\\n\\\"so that was it?\\\" archer said derisively.\\n\\n\\\"i didn't know he was here,\\\" madame olenska murmured.  her hand still\\nclung to archer's; but he drew away from her, and walking out into the\\npassage threw open the door of the house.\\n\\n\\\"hallo, beaufort--this way!  madame olenska was expecting you,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\nduring his journey back to new york the next morning, archer relived\\nwith a fatiguing vividness his last moments at skuytercliff.\\n\\nbeaufort, though clearly annoyed at finding him with madame olenska,\\nhad, as usual, carried off the situation high-handedly.  his way of\\nignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them,\\nif they were sensitive to it, a feeling of invisibility, of\\nnonexistence.  archer, as the three strolled back through the park, was\\naware of this odd sense of disembodiment; and humbling as it was to his\\nvanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved.\\n\\nbeaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance;\\nbut he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes.  it was\\nfairly clear that madame olenska had not known that he was coming,\\nthough her words to archer had hinted at the possibility; at any rate,\\nshe had evidently not told him where she was going when she left new\\nyork, and her unexplained departure had exasperated him.  the\\nostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery, the very night\\nbefore, of a \\\"perfect little house,\\\" not in the market, which was\\nreally just the thing for her, but would be snapped up instantly if she\\ndidn't take it; and he was loud in mock-reproaches for the dance she\\nhad led him in running away just as he had found it.\\n\\n\\\"if only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit\\nnearer perfection i might have told you all this from town, and been\\ntoasting my toes before the club fire at this minute, instead of\\ntramping after you through the snow,\\\" he grumbled, disguising a real\\nirritation under the pretence of it; and at this opening madame olenska\\ntwisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one\\nday actually converse with each other from street to street, or\\neven--incredible dream!--from one town to another.  this struck from\\nall three allusions to edgar poe and jules verne, and such platitudes\\nas naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are\\ntalking against time, and dealing with a new invention in which it\\nwould seem ingenuous to believe too soon; and the question of the\\ntelephone carried them safely back to the big house.\\n\\nmrs. van der luyden had not yet returned; and archer took his leave and\\nwalked off to fetch the cutter, while beaufort followed the countess\\nolenska indoors.  it was probable that, little as the van der luydens\\nencouraged unannounced visits, he could count on being asked to dine,\\nand sent back to the station to catch the nine o'clock train; but more\\nthan that he would certainly not get, for it would be inconceivable to\\nhis hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to\\nspend the night, and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with\\nwhom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as beaufort.\\n\\nbeaufort knew all this, and must have foreseen it; and his taking the\\nlong journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience.\\nhe was undeniably in pursuit of the countess olenska; and beaufort had\\nonly one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women.  his dull and\\nchildless home had long since palled on him; and in addition to more\\npermanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in\\nhis own set.  this was the man from whom madame olenska was avowedly\\nflying: the question was whether she had fled because his importunities\\ndispleased her, or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist\\nthem; unless, indeed, all her talk of flight had been a blind, and her\\ndeparture no more than a manoeuvre.\\n\\narcher did not really believe this.  little as he had actually seen of\\nmadame olenska, he was beginning to think that he could read her face,\\nand if not her face, her voice; and both had betrayed annoyance, and\\neven dismay, at beaufort's sudden appearance.  but, after all, if this\\nwere the case, was it not worse than if she had left new york for the\\nexpress purpose of meeting him?  if she had done that, she ceased to be\\nan object of interest, she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of\\ndissemblers: a woman engaged in a love affair with beaufort \\\"classed\\\"\\nherself irretrievably.\\n\\nno, it was worse a thousand times if, judging beaufort, and probably\\ndespising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an\\nadvantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and\\ntwo societies, his familiar association with artists and actors and\\npeople generally in the world's eye, and his careless contempt for\\nlocal prejudices.  beaufort was vulgar, he was uneducated, he was\\npurse-proud; but the circumstances of his life, and a certain native\\nshrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and\\nsocially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the battery and the\\ncentral park.  how should any one coming from a wider world not feel\\nthe difference and be attracted by it?\\n\\nmadame olenska, in a burst of irritation, had said to archer that he\\nand she did not talk the same language; and the young man knew that in\\nsome respects this was true.  but beaufort understood every turn of her\\ndialect, and spoke it fluently: his view of life, his tone, his\\nattitude, were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in count\\nolenski's letter.  this might seem to be to his disadvantage with count\\nolenski's wife; but archer was too intelligent to think that a young\\nwoman like ellen olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that\\nreminded her of her past.  she might believe herself wholly in revolt\\nagainst it; but what had charmed her in it would still charm her, even\\nthough it were against her will.\\n\\nthus, with a painful impartiality, did the young man make out the case\\nfor beaufort, and for beaufort's victim.  a longing to enlighten her\\nwas strong in him; and there were moments when he imagined that all she\\nasked was to be enlightened.\\n\\nthat evening he unpacked his books from london.  the box was full of\\nthings he had been waiting for impatiently; a new volume of herbert\\nspencer, another collection of the prolific alphonse daudet's brilliant\\ntales, and a novel called \\\"middlemarch,\\\" as to which there had lately\\nbeen interesting things said in the reviews.  he had declined three\\ndinner invitations in favour of this feast; but though he turned the\\npages with the sensuous joy of the book-lover, he did not know what he\\nwas reading, and one book after another dropped from his hand.\\nsuddenly, among them, he lit on a small volume of verse which he had\\nordered because the name had attracted him:  \\\"the house of life.\\\"  he\\ntook it up, and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he\\nhad ever breathed in books; so warm, so rich, and yet so ineffably\\ntender, that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary\\nof human passions.  all through the night he pursued through those\\nenchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of ellen\\nolenska; but when he woke the next morning, and looked out at the\\nbrownstone houses across the street, and thought of his desk in mr.\\nletterblair's office, and the family pew in grace church, his hour in\\nthe park of skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability\\nas the visions of the night.\\n\\n\\\"mercy, how pale you look, newland!\\\" janey commented over the\\ncoffee-cups at breakfast; and his mother added:  \\\"newland, dear, i've\\nnoticed lately that you've been coughing; i do hope you're not letting\\nyourself be overworked?\\\"  for it was the conviction of both ladies\\nthat, under the iron despotism of his senior partners, the young man's\\nlife was spent in the most exhausting professional labours--and he had\\nnever thought it necessary to undeceive them.\\n\\nthe next two or three days dragged by heavily.  the taste of the usual\\nwas like cinders in his mouth, and there were moments when he felt as\\nif he were being buried alive under his future.  he heard nothing of\\nthe countess olenska, or of the perfect little house, and though he met\\nbeaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the\\nwhist-tables.  it was not till the fourth evening that he found a note\\nawaiting him on his return home.  \\\"come late tomorrow: i must explain\\nto you.  ellen.\\\"  these were the only words it contained.\\n\\nthe young man, who was dining out, thrust the note into his pocket,\\nsmiling a little at the frenchness of the \\\"to you.\\\"  after dinner he\\nwent to a play; and it was not until his return home, after midnight,\\nthat he drew madame olenska's missive out again and re-read it slowly a\\nnumber of times.  there were several ways of answering it, and he gave\\nconsiderable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated\\nnight.  that on which, when morning came, he finally decided was to\\npitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was\\nleaving that very afternoon for st. augustine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen archer walked down the sandy main street of st. augustine to the\\nhouse which had been pointed out to him as mr. welland's, and saw may\\nwelland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair, he wondered\\nwhy he had waited so long to come.\\n\\nhere was the truth, here was reality, here was the life that belonged\\nto him; and he, who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary\\nrestraints, had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what\\npeople might think of his stealing a holiday!\\n\\nher first exclamation was:  \\\"newland--has anything happened?\\\" and it\\noccurred to him that it would have been more \\\"feminine\\\" if she had\\ninstantly read in his eyes why he had come.  but when he answered:\\n\\\"yes--i found i had to see you,\\\" her happy blushes took the chill from\\nher surprise, and he saw how easily he would be forgiven, and how soon\\neven mr. letterblair's mild disapproval would be smiled away by a\\ntolerant family.\\n\\nearly as it was, the main street was no place for any but formal\\ngreetings, and archer longed to be alone with may, and to pour out all\\nhis tenderness and his impatience.  it still lacked an hour to the late\\nwelland breakfast-time, and instead of asking him to come in she\\nproposed that they should walk out to an old orange-garden beyond the\\ntown.  she had just been for a row on the river, and the sun that\\nnetted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its\\nmeshes.  across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered\\nlike silver wire; and her eyes too looked lighter, almost pale in their\\nyouthful limpidity.  as she walked beside archer with her long swinging\\ngait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete.\\n\\nto archer's strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of\\nthe blue sky and the lazy river.  they sat down on a bench under the\\norange-trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her.  it was like\\ndrinking at a cold spring with the sun on it; but his pressure may have\\nbeen more vehement than he had intended, for the blood rose to her face\\nand she drew back as if he had startled her.\\n\\n\\\"what is it?\\\" he asked, smiling; and she looked at him with surprise,\\nand answered:  \\\"nothing.\\\"\\n\\na slight embarrassment fell on them, and her hand slipped out of his.\\nit was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for\\ntheir fugitive embrace in the beaufort conservatory, and he saw that\\nshe was disturbed, and shaken out of her cool boyish composure.\\n\\n\\\"tell me what you do all day,\\\" he said, crossing his arms under his\\ntilted-back head, and pushing his hat forward to screen the sun-dazzle.\\nto let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of\\ncarrying on his own independent train of thought; and he sat listening\\nto her simple chronicle of swimming, sailing and riding, varied by an\\noccasional dance at the primitive inn when a man-of-war came in.  a few\\npleasant people from philadelphia and baltimore were picknicking at the\\ninn, and the selfridge merrys had come down for three weeks because\\nkate merry had had bronchitis.  they were planning to lay out a lawn\\ntennis court on the sands; but no one but kate and may had racquets,\\nand most of the people had not even heard of the game.\\n\\nall this kept her very busy, and she had not had time to do more than\\nlook at the little vellum book that archer had sent her the week before\\n(the \\\"sonnets from the portuguese\\\"); but she was learning by heart \\\"how\\nthey brought the good news from ghent to aix,\\\" because it was one of\\nthe first things he had ever read to her; and it amused her to be able\\nto tell him that kate merry had never even heard of a poet called\\nrobert browning.\\n\\npresently she started up, exclaiming that they would be late for\\nbreakfast; and they hurried back to the tumble-down house with its\\npointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where\\nthe wellands were installed for the winter.  mr. welland's sensitive\\ndomesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel,\\nand at immense expense, and in face of almost insuperable difficulties,\\nmrs. welland was obliged, year after year, to improvise an\\nestablishment partly made up of discontented new york servants and\\npartly drawn from the local african supply.\\n\\n\\\"the doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home;\\notherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any\\ngood,\\\" she explained, winter after winter, to the sympathising\\nphiladelphians and baltimoreans; and mr. welland, beaming across a\\nbreakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies,\\nwas presently saying to archer: \\\"you see, my dear fellow, we camp--we\\nliterally camp.  i tell my wife and may that i want to teach them how\\nto rough it.\\\"\\n\\nmr. and mrs. welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by\\nthe young man's sudden arrival; but it had occurred to him to explain\\nthat he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold, and this seemed\\nto mr. welland an all-sufficient reason for abandoning any duty.\\n\\n\\\"you can't be too careful, especially toward spring,\\\" he said, heaping\\nhis plate with straw-coloured griddle-cakes and drowning them in golden\\nsyrup.  \\\"if i'd only been as prudent at your age may would have been\\ndancing at the assemblies now, instead of spending her winters in a\\nwilderness with an old invalid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, but i love it here, papa; you know i do.  if only newland could\\nstay i should like it a thousand times better than new york.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold,\\\" said mrs.\\nwelland indulgently; and the young man laughed, and said he supposed\\nthere was such a thing as one's profession.\\n\\nhe managed, however, after an exchange of telegrams with the firm, to\\nmake his cold last a week; and it shed an ironic light on the situation\\nto know that mr. letterblair's indulgence was partly due to the\\nsatisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had\\nsettled the troublesome matter of the olenski divorce.  mr. letterblair\\nhad let mrs. welland know that mr. archer had \\\"rendered an invaluable\\nservice\\\" to the whole family, and that old mrs. manson mingott had been\\nparticularly pleased; and one day when may had gone for a drive with\\nher father in the only vehicle the place produced mrs. welland took\\noccasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter's\\npresence.\\n\\n\\\"i'm afraid ellen's ideas are not at all like ours.  she was barely\\neighteen when medora manson took her back to europe--you remember the\\nexcitement when she appeared in black at her coming-out ball?  another\\nof medora's fads--really this time it was almost prophetic!  that must\\nhave been at least twelve years ago; and since then ellen has never\\nbeen to america.  no wonder she is completely europeanised.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but european society is not given to divorce: countess olenska thought\\nshe would be conforming to american ideas in asking for her freedom.\\\"\\nit was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since\\nhe had left skuytercliff, and he felt the colour rise to his cheek.\\n\\nmrs. welland smiled compassionately.  \\\"that is just like the\\nextraordinary things that foreigners invent about us. they think we\\ndine at two o'clock and countenance divorce!  that is why it seems to\\nme so foolish to entertain them when they come to new york.  they\\naccept our hospitality, and then they go home and repeat the same\\nstupid stories.\\\"\\n\\narcher made no comment on this, and mrs. welland continued:  \\\"but we do\\nmost thoroughly appreciate your persuading ellen to give up the idea.\\nher grandmother and her uncle lovell could do nothing with her; both of\\nthem have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your\\ninfluence--in fact she said so to her grandmother.  she has an\\nunbounded admiration for you.  poor ellen--she was always a wayward\\nchild.  i wonder what her fate will be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what we've all contrived to make it,\\\" he felt like answering.  \\\"if\\nyou'd all of you rather she should be beaufort's mistress than some\\ndecent fellow's wife you've certainly gone the right way about it.\\\"\\n\\nhe wondered what mrs. welland would have said if he had uttered the\\nwords instead of merely thinking them.  he could picture the sudden\\ndecomposure of her firm placid features, to which a lifelong mastery\\nover trifles had given an air of factitious authority.  traces still\\nlingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughter's; and he asked\\nhimself if may's face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged\\nimage of invincible innocence.\\n\\nah, no, he did not want may to have that kind of innocence, the\\ninnocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against\\nexperience!\\n\\n\\\"i verily believe,\\\" mrs. welland continued, \\\"that if the horrible\\nbusiness had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husband's\\ndeath-blow.  i don't know any of the details; i only ask not to, as i\\ntold poor ellen when she tried to talk to me about it.  having an\\ninvalid to care for, i have to keep my mind bright and happy.  but mr.\\nwelland was terribly upset; he had a slight temperature every morning\\nwhile we were waiting to hear what had been decided.  it was the horror\\nof his girl's learning that such things were possible--but of course,\\ndear newland, you felt that too.  we all knew that you were thinking of\\nmay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i'm always thinking of may,\\\" the young man rejoined, rising to cut\\nshort the conversation.\\n\\nhe had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with mrs.\\nwelland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage.  but he could\\nthink of no arguments that would move her, and with a sense of relief\\nhe saw mr. welland and may driving up to the door.\\n\\nhis only hope was to plead again with may, and on the day before his\\ndeparture he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the spanish\\nmission.  the background lent itself to allusions to european scenes;\\nand may, who was looking her loveliest under a wide-brimmed hat that\\ncast a shadow of mystery over her too-clear eyes, kindled into\\neagerness as he spoke of granada and the alhambra.\\n\\n\\\"we might be seeing it all this spring--even the easter ceremonies at\\nseville,\\\" he urged, exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger\\nconcession.\\n\\n\\\"easter in seville?  and it will be lent next week!\\\" she laughed.\\n\\n\\\"why shouldn't we be married in lent?\\\" he rejoined; but she looked so\\nshocked that he saw his mistake.\\n\\n\\\"of course i didn't mean that, dearest; but soon after easter--so that\\nwe could sail at the end of april.  i know i could arrange it at the\\noffice.\\\"\\n\\nshe smiled dreamily upon the possibility; but he perceived that to\\ndream of it sufficed her.  it was like hearing him read aloud out of\\nhis poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in\\nreal life.\\n\\n\\\"oh, do go on, newland; i do love your descriptions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but why should they be only descriptions?  why shouldn't we make them\\nreal?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"we shall, dearest, of course; next year.\\\"  her voice lingered over it.\\n\\n\\\"don't you want them to be real sooner?  can't i persuade you to break\\naway now?\\\"\\n\\nshe bowed her head, vanishing from him under her conniving hat-brim.\\n\\n\\\"why should we dream away another year?  look at me, dear!  don't you\\nunderstand how i want you for my wife?\\\"\\n\\nfor a moment she remained motionless; then she raised on him eyes of\\nsuch despairing dearness that he half-released her waist from his hold.\\nbut suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably.  \\\"i'm not sure\\nif i do understand,\\\" she said.  \\\"is it--is it because you're not\\ncertain of continuing to care for me?\\\"\\n\\narcher sprang up from his seat.  \\\"my god--perhaps--i don't know,\\\" he\\nbroke out angrily.\\n\\nmay welland rose also; as they faced each other she seemed to grow in\\nwomanly stature and dignity.  both were silent for a moment, as if\\ndismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words: then she said in a low\\nvoice: \\\"if that is it--is there some one else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"some one else--between you and me?\\\"  he echoed her words slowly, as\\nthough they were only half-intelligible and he wanted time to repeat\\nthe question to himself.  she seemed to catch the uncertainty of his\\nvoice, for she went on in a deepening tone:  \\\"let us talk frankly,\\nnewland.  sometimes i've felt a difference in you; especially since our\\nengagement has been announced.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"dear--what madness!\\\" he recovered himself to exclaim.\\n\\nshe met his protest with a faint smile.  \\\"if it is, it won't hurt us to\\ntalk about it.\\\"  she paused, and added, lifting her head with one of\\nher noble movements:  \\\"or even if it's true: why shouldn't we speak of\\nit?  you might so easily have made a mistake.\\\"\\n\\nhe lowered his head, staring at the black leaf-pattern on the sunny\\npath at their feet.  \\\"mistakes are always easy to make; but if i had\\nmade one of the kind you suggest, is it likely that i should be\\nimploring you to hasten our marriage?\\\"\\n\\nshe looked downward too, disturbing the pattern with the point of her\\nsunshade while she struggled for expression.  \\\"yes,\\\" she said at\\nlength.  \\\"you might want--once for all--to settle the question: it's\\none way.\\\"\\n\\nher quiet lucidity startled him, but did not mislead him into thinking\\nher insensible.  under her hat-brim he saw the pallor of her profile,\\nand a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips.\\n\\n\\\"well--?\\\" he questioned, sitting down on the bench, and looking up at\\nher with a frown that he tried to make playful.\\n\\nshe dropped back into her seat and went on:  \\\"you mustn't think that a\\ngirl knows as little as her parents imagine.  one hears and one\\nnotices--one has one's feelings and ideas.  and of course, long before\\nyou told me that you cared for me, i'd known that there was some one\\nelse you were interested in; every one was talking about it two years\\nago at newport.  and once i saw you sitting together on the verandah at\\na dance--and when she came back into the house her face was sad, and i\\nfelt sorry for her; i remembered it afterward, when we were engaged.\\\"\\n\\nher voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and she sat clasping and\\nunclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade.  the young man\\nlaid his upon them with a gentle pressure; his heart dilated with an\\ninexpressible relief.\\n\\n\\\"my dear child--was that it?  if you only knew the truth!\\\"\\n\\nshe raised her head quickly.  \\\"then there is a truth i don't know?\\\"\\n\\nhe kept his hand over hers.  \\\"i meant, the truth about the old story\\nyou speak of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but that's what i want to know, newland--what i ought to know.  i\\ncouldn't have my happiness made out of a wrong--an unfairness--to\\nsomebody else.  and i want to believe that it would be the same with\\nyou.  what sort of a life could we build on such foundations?\\\"\\n\\nher face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like\\nbowing himself down at her feet.  \\\"i've wanted to say this for a long\\ntime,\\\" she went on.  \\\"i've wanted to tell you that, when two people\\nreally love each other, i understand that there may be situations which\\nmake it right that they should--should go against public opinion.  and\\nif you feel yourself in any way pledged ... pledged to the person we've\\nspoken of ...  and if there is any way ... any way in which you can\\nfulfill your pledge ... even by her getting a divorce ...  newland,\\ndon't give her up because of me!\\\"\\n\\nhis surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode\\nso remote and so completely of the past as his love-affair with mrs.\\nthorley rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view.\\nthere was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox,\\nand if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in\\nwonder at the prodigy of the wellands' daughter urging him to marry his\\nformer mistress.  but he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the\\nprecipice they had skirted, and full of a new awe at the mystery of\\nyoung-girlhood.\\n\\nfor a moment he could not speak; then he said: \\\"there is no pledge--no\\nobligation whatever--of the kind you think.  such cases don't\\nalways--present themselves quite as simply as ... but that's no matter\\n... i love your generosity, because i feel as you do about those things\\n... i feel that each case must be judged individually, on its own\\nmerits ... irrespective of stupid conventionalities ... i mean, each\\nwoman's right to her liberty--\\\"  he pulled himself up, startled by the\\nturn his thoughts had taken, and went on, looking at her with a smile:\\n\\\"since you understand so many things, dearest, can't you go a little\\nfarther, and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another\\nform of the same foolish conventionalities?  if there's no one and\\nnothing between us, isn't that an argument for marrying quickly, rather\\nthan for more delay?\\\"\\n\\nshe flushed with joy and lifted her face to his; as he bent to it he\\nsaw that her eyes were full of happy tears.  but in another moment she\\nseemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and\\ntimorous girlhood; and he understood that her courage and initiative\\nwere all for others, and that she had none for herself.  it was evident\\nthat the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied\\ncomposure betrayed, and that at his first word of reassurance she had\\ndropped back into the usual, as a too-adventurous child takes refuge in\\nits mother's arms.\\n\\narcher had no heart to go on pleading with her; he was too much\\ndisappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one\\ndeep look at him from her transparent eyes.  may seemed to be aware of\\nhis disappointment, but without knowing how to alleviate it; and they\\nstood up and walked silently home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"your cousin the countess called on mother while you were away,\\\" janey\\narcher announced to her brother on the evening of his return.\\n\\nthe young man, who was dining alone with his mother and sister, glanced\\nup in surprise and saw mrs. archer's gaze demurely bent on her plate.\\nmrs. archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for\\nbeing forgotten by it; and newland guessed that she was slightly\\nannoyed that he should be surprised by madame olenska's visit.\\n\\n\\\"she had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons, and a tiny green\\nmonkey muff; i never saw her so stylishly dressed,\\\" janey continued.\\n\\\"she came alone, early on sunday afternoon; luckily the fire was lit in\\nthe drawing-room.  she had one of those new card-cases.  she said she\\nwanted to know us because you'd been so good to her.\\\"\\n\\nnewland laughed.  \\\"madame olenska always takes that tone about her\\nfriends.  she's very happy at being among her own people again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes, so she told us,\\\" said mrs. archer.  \\\"i must say she seems\\nthankful to be here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i hope you liked her, mother.\\\"\\n\\nmrs. archer drew her lips together.  \\\"she certainly lays herself out to\\nplease, even when she is calling on an old lady.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"mother doesn't think her simple,\\\" janey interjected, her eyes screwed\\nupon her brother's face.\\n\\n\\\"it's just my old-fashioned feeling; dear may is my ideal,\\\" said mrs.\\narcher.\\n\\n\\\"ah,\\\" said her son, \\\"they're not alike.\\\"\\n\\n\\narcher had left st. augustine charged with many messages for old mrs.\\nmingott; and a day or two after his return to town he called on her.\\n\\nthe old lady received him with unusual warmth; she was grateful to him\\nfor persuading the countess olenska to give up the idea of a divorce;\\nand when he told her that he had deserted the office without leave, and\\nrushed down to st. augustine simply because he wanted to see may, she\\ngave an adipose chuckle and patted his knee with her puff-ball hand.\\n\\n\\\"ah, ah--so you kicked over the traces, did you?  and i suppose augusta\\nand welland pulled long faces, and behaved as if the end of the world\\nhad come?  but little may--she knew better, i'll be bound?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i hoped she did; but after all she wouldn't agree to what i'd gone\\ndown to ask for.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"wouldn't she indeed?  and what was that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in april.\\nwhat's the use of our wasting another year?\\\"\\n\\nmrs. manson mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic\\nprudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids.  \\\"'ask mamma,' i\\nsuppose--the usual story.  ah, these mingotts--all alike!  born in a\\nrut, and you can't root 'em out of it.  when i built this house you'd\\nhave thought i was moving to california!  nobody ever had built above\\nfortieth street--no, says i, nor above the battery either, before\\nchristopher columbus discovered america.  no, no; not one of them wants\\nto be different; they're as scared of it as the small-pox.  ah, my dear\\nmr. archer, i thank my stars i'm nothing but a vulgar spicer; but\\nthere's not one of my own children that takes after me but my little\\nellen.\\\"  she broke off, still twinkling at him, and asked, with the\\ncasual irrelevance of old age:  \\\"now, why in the world didn't you marry\\nmy little ellen?\\\"\\n\\narcher laughed.  \\\"for one thing, she wasn't there to be married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no--to be sure; more's the pity.  and now it's too late; her life is\\nfinished.\\\"  she spoke with the cold-blooded complacency of the aged\\nthrowing earth into the grave of young hopes.  the young man's heart\\ngrew chill, and he said hurriedly:  \\\"can't i persuade you to use your\\ninfluence with the wellands, mrs. mingott?  i wasn't made for long\\nengagements.\\\"\\n\\nold catherine beamed on him approvingly.  \\\"no; i can see that.  you've\\ngot a quick eye.  when you were a little boy i've no doubt you liked to\\nbe helped first.\\\" she threw back her head with a laugh that made her\\nchins ripple like little waves.  \\\"ah, here's my ellen now!\\\" she\\nexclaimed, as the portieres parted behind her.\\n\\nmadame olenska came forward with a smile.  her face looked vivid and\\nhappy, and she held out her hand gaily to archer while she stooped to\\nher grandmother's kiss.\\n\\n\\\"i was just saying to him, my dear:  'now, why didn't you marry my\\nlittle ellen?'\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska looked at archer, still smiling.  \\\"and what did he\\nanswer?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, my darling, i leave you to find that out!  he's been down to\\nflorida to see his sweetheart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes, i know.\\\"  she still looked at him.  \\\"i went to see your mother,\\nto ask where you'd gone.  i sent a note that you never answered, and i\\nwas afraid you were ill.\\\"\\n\\nhe muttered something about leaving unexpectedly, in a great hurry, and\\nhaving intended to write to her from st. augustine.\\n\\n\\\"and of course once you were there you never thought of me again!\\\"  she\\ncontinued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied\\nassumption of indifference.\\n\\n\\\"if she still needs me, she's determined not to let me see it,\\\" he\\nthought, stung by her manner.  he wanted to thank her for having been\\nto see his mother, but under the ancestress's malicious eye he felt\\nhimself tongue-tied and constrained.\\n\\n\\\"look at him--in such hot haste to get married that he took french\\nleave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees!  that's\\nsomething like a lover--that's the way handsome bob spicer carried off\\nmy poor mother; and then got tired of her before i was weaned--though\\nthey only had to wait eight months for me!  but there--you're not a\\nspicer, young man; luckily for you and for may.  it's only my poor\\nellen that has kept any of their wicked blood; the rest of them are all\\nmodel mingotts,\\\" cried the old lady scornfully.\\n\\narcher was aware that madame olenska, who had seated herself at her\\ngrandmother's side, was still thoughtfully scrutinising him.  the\\ngaiety had faded from her eyes, and she said with great gentleness:\\n\\\"surely, granny, we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes.\\\"\\n\\narcher rose to go, and as his hand met madame olenska's he felt that\\nshe was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter.\\n\\n\\\"when can i see you?\\\" he asked, as she walked with him to the door of\\nthe room.\\n\\n\\\"whenever you like; but it must be soon if you want to see the little\\nhouse again.  i am moving next week.\\\"\\n\\na pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the\\nlow-studded drawing-room.  few as they had been, they were thick with\\nmemories.\\n\\n\\\"tomorrow evening?\\\"\\n\\nshe nodded.  \\\"tomorrow; yes; but early.  i'm going out.\\\"\\n\\nthe next day was a sunday, and if she were \\\"going out\\\" on a sunday\\nevening it could, of course, be only to mrs. lemuel struthers's.  he\\nfelt a slight movement of annoyance, not so much at her going there\\n(for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van\\nder luydens), but because it was the kind of house at which she was\\nsure to meet beaufort, where she must have known beforehand that she\\nwould meet him--and where she was probably going for that purpose.\\n\\n\\\"very well; tomorrow evening,\\\" he repeated, inwardly resolved that he\\nwould not go early, and that by reaching her door late he would either\\nprevent her from going to mrs. struthers's, or else arrive after she\\nhad started--which, all things considered, would no doubt be the\\nsimplest solution.\\n\\n\\nit was only half-past eight, after all, when he rang the bell under the\\nwisteria; not as late as he had intended by half an hour--but a\\nsingular restlessness had driven him to her door.  he reflected,\\nhowever, that mrs. struthers's sunday evenings were not like a ball,\\nand that her guests, as if to minimise their delinquency, usually went\\nearly.\\n\\nthe one thing he had not counted on, in entering madame olenska's hall,\\nwas to find hats and overcoats there.  why had she bidden him to come\\nearly if she was having people to dine?  on a closer inspection of the\\ngarments besides which nastasia was laying his own, his resentment gave\\nway to curiosity.  the overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had\\never seen under a polite roof; and it took but a glance to assure\\nhimself that neither of them belonged to julius beaufort.  one was a\\nshaggy yellow ulster of \\\"reach-me-down\\\" cut, the other a very old and\\nrusty cloak with a cape--something like what the french called a\\n\\\"macfarlane.\\\" this garment, which appeared to be made for a person of\\nprodigious size, had evidently seen long and hard wear, and its\\ngreenish-black folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of\\nprolonged sessions against bar-room walls.  on it lay a ragged grey\\nscarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape.\\n\\narcher raised his eyebrows enquiringly at nastasia, who raised hers in\\nreturn with a fatalistic \\\"gia!\\\" as she threw open the drawing-room door.\\n\\nthe young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room; then,\\nwith surprise, he discovered another lady standing by the fire.  this\\nlady, who was long, lean and loosely put together, was clad in raiment\\nintricately looped and fringed, with plaids and stripes and bands of\\nplain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing.\\nher hair, which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading,\\nwas surmounted by a spanish comb and black lace scarf, and silk\\nmittens, visibly darned, covered her rheumatic hands.\\n\\nbeside her, in a cloud of cigar-smoke, stood the owners of the two\\novercoats, both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken\\noff since morning.  in one of the two, archer, to his surprise,\\nrecognised ned winsett; the other and older, who was unknown to him,\\nand whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the\\n\\\"macfarlane,\\\" had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair, and\\nmoved his arms with large pawing gestures, as though he were\\ndistributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude.\\n\\nthese three persons stood together on the hearth-rug, their eyes fixed\\non an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses, with a knot of\\npurple pansies at their base, that lay on the sofa where madame olenska\\nusually sat.\\n\\n\\\"what they must have cost at this season--though of course it's the\\nsentiment one cares about!\\\" the lady was saying in a sighing staccato\\nas archer came in.\\n\\nthe three turned with surprise at his appearance, and the lady,\\nadvancing, held out her hand.\\n\\n\\\"dear mr. archer--almost my cousin newland!\\\" she said.  \\\"i am the\\nmarchioness manson.\\\"\\n\\narcher bowed, and she continued:  \\\"my ellen has taken me in for a few\\ndays.  i came from cuba, where i have been spending the winter with\\nspanish friends--such delightful distinguished people: the highest\\nnobility of old castile--how i wish you could know them!  but i was\\ncalled away by our dear great friend here, dr. carver.  you don't know\\ndr. agathon carver, founder of the valley of love community?\\\"\\n\\ndr. carver inclined his leonine head, and the marchioness continued:\\n\\\"ah, new york--new york--how little the life of the spirit has reached\\nit!  but i see you do know mr. winsett.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, yes--i reached him some time ago; but not by that route,\\\" winsett\\nsaid with his dry smile.\\n\\nthe marchioness shook her head reprovingly.  \\\"how do you know, mr.\\nwinsett?  the spirit bloweth where it listeth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"list--oh, list!\\\" interjected dr. carver in a stentorian murmur.\\n\\n\\\"but do sit down, mr. archer.  we four have been having a delightful\\nlittle dinner together, and my child has gone up to dress.  she expects\\nyou; she will be down in a moment.  we were just admiring these\\nmarvellous flowers, which will surprise her when she reappears.\\\"\\n\\nwinsett remained on his feet.  \\\"i'm afraid i must be off.  please tell\\nmadame olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our\\nstreet.  this house has been an oasis.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, but she won't abandon you.  poetry and art are the breath of life\\nto her.  it is poetry you write, mr. winsett?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, no; but i sometimes read it,\\\" said winsett, including the group\\nin a general nod and slipping out of the room.\\n\\n\\\"a caustic spirit--un peu sauvage.  but so witty; dr. carver, you do\\nthink him witty?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i never think of wit,\\\" said dr. carver severely.\\n\\n\\\"ah--ah--you never think of wit!  how merciless he is to us weak\\nmortals, mr. archer!  but he lives only in the life of the spirit; and\\ntonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently\\nat mrs. blenker's.  dr. carver, would there be time, before you start\\nfor the blenkers' to explain to mr. archer your illuminating discovery\\nof the direct contact?  but no; i see it is nearly nine o'clock, and we\\nhave no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message.\\\"\\n\\ndr. carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion, but, having\\ncompared his ponderous gold time-piece with madame olenska's little\\ntravelling-clock, he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for\\ndeparture.\\n\\n\\\"i shall see you later, dear friend?\\\" he suggested to the marchioness,\\nwho replied with a smile:  \\\"as soon as ellen's carriage comes i will\\njoin you; i do hope the lecture won't have begun.\\\"\\n\\ndr. carver looked thoughtfully at archer.  \\\"perhaps, if this young\\ngentleman is interested in my experiences, mrs. blenker might allow you\\nto bring him with you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, dear friend, if it were possible--i am sure she would be too\\nhappy.  but i fear my ellen counts on mr. archer herself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"that,\\\" said dr. carver, \\\"is unfortunate--but here is my card.\\\"  he\\nhanded it to archer, who read on it, in gothic characters:\\n\\n  +---------------------------+\\n  |      agathon carver       |\\n  |    the valley of love     |\\n  |   kittasquattamy, n. y.   |\\n  +---------------------------+\\n\\n\\ndr. carver bowed himself out, and mrs. manson, with a sigh that might\\nhave been either of regret or relief, again waved archer to a seat.\\n\\n\\\"ellen will be down in a moment; and before she comes, i am so glad of\\nthis quiet moment with you.\\\"\\n\\narcher murmured his pleasure at their meeting, and the marchioness\\ncontinued, in her low sighing accents: \\\"i know everything, dear mr.\\narcher--my child has told me all you have done for her.  your wise\\nadvice: your courageous firmness--thank heaven it was not too late!\\\"\\n\\nthe young man listened with considerable embarrassment.  was there any\\none, he wondered, to whom madame olenska had not proclaimed his\\nintervention in her private affairs?\\n\\n\\\"madame olenska exaggerates; i simply gave her a legal opinion, as she\\nasked me to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, but in doing it--in doing it you were the unconscious instrument\\nof--of--what word have we moderns for providence, mr. archer?\\\" cried\\nthe lady, tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids\\nmysteriously.  \\\"little did you know that at that very moment i was\\nbeing appealed to: being approached, in fact--from the other side of\\nthe atlantic!\\\"\\n\\nshe glanced over her shoulder, as though fearful of being overheard,\\nand then, drawing her chair nearer, and raising a tiny ivory fan to her\\nlips, breathed behind it:  \\\"by the count himself--my poor, mad, foolish\\nolenski; who asks only to take her back on her own terms.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"good god!\\\" archer exclaimed, springing up.\\n\\n\\\"you are horrified?  yes, of course; i understand.  i don't defend poor\\nstanislas, though he has always called me his best friend.  he does not\\ndefend himself--he casts himself at her feet: in my person.\\\"  she\\ntapped her emaciated bosom.  \\\"i have his letter here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"a letter?--has madame olenska seen it?\\\" archer stammered, his brain\\nwhirling with the shock of the announcement.\\n\\nthe marchioness manson shook her head softly.  \\\"time--time; i must have\\ntime.  i know my ellen--haughty, intractable; shall i say, just a shade\\nunforgiving?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but, good heavens, to forgive is one thing; to go back into that\\nhell--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, yes,\\\" the marchioness acquiesced.  \\\"so she describes it--my\\nsensitive child!  but on the material side, mr. archer, if one may\\nstoop to consider such things; do you know what she is giving up?\\nthose roses there on the sofa--acres like them, under glass and in the\\nopen, in his matchless terraced gardens at nice!  jewels--historic\\npearls: the sobieski emeralds--sables,--but she cares nothing for all\\nthese!  art and beauty, those she does care for, she lives for, as i\\nalways have; and those also surrounded her.  pictures, priceless\\nfurniture, music, brilliant conversation--ah, that, my dear young man,\\nif you'll excuse me, is what you've no conception of here!  and she had\\nit all; and the homage of the greatest.  she tells me she is not\\nthought handsome in new york--good heavens!  her portrait has been\\npainted nine times; the greatest artists in europe have begged for the\\nprivilege.  are these things nothing?  and the remorse of an adoring\\nhusband?\\\"\\n\\nas the marchioness manson rose to her climax her face assumed an\\nexpression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved archer's\\nmirth had he not been numb with amazement.\\n\\nhe would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first\\nsight of poor medora manson would have been in the guise of a messenger\\nof satan; but he was in no mood for laughing now, and she seemed to him\\nto come straight out of the hell from which ellen olenska had just\\nescaped.\\n\\n\\\"she knows nothing yet--of all this?\\\" he asked abruptly.\\n\\nmrs. manson laid a purple finger on her lips.  \\\"nothing directly--but\\ndoes she suspect?  who can tell?  the truth is, mr. archer, i have been\\nwaiting to see you.  from the moment i heard of the firm stand you had\\ntaken, and of your influence over her, i hoped it might be possible to\\ncount on your support--to convince you ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"that she ought to go back?  i would rather see her dead!\\\" cried the\\nyoung man violently.\\n\\n\\\"ah,\\\" the marchioness murmured, without visible resentment.  for a\\nwhile she sat in her arm-chair, opening and shutting the absurd ivory\\nfan between her mittened fingers; but suddenly she lifted her head and\\nlistened.\\n\\n\\\"here she comes,\\\" she said in a rapid whisper; and then, pointing to\\nthe bouquet on the sofa:  \\\"am i to understand that you prefer that, mr.\\narcher?  after all, marriage is marriage ... and my niece is still a\\nwife...\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"what are you two plotting together, aunt medora?\\\" madame olenska cried\\nas she came into the room.\\n\\nshe was dressed as if for a ball.  everything about her shimmered and\\nglimmered softly, as if her dress had been woven out of candle-beams;\\nand she carried her head high, like a pretty woman challenging a\\nroomful of rivals.\\n\\n\\\"we were saying, my dear, that here was something beautiful to surprise\\nyou with,\\\" mrs. manson rejoined, rising to her feet and pointing archly\\nto the flowers.\\n\\nmadame olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet.  her colour did\\nnot change, but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like\\nsummer lightning.  \\\"ah,\\\" she exclaimed, in a shrill voice that the\\nyoung man had never heard, \\\"who is ridiculous enough to send me a\\nbouquet?  why a bouquet?  and why tonight of all nights?  i am not\\ngoing to a ball; i am not a girl engaged to be married.  but some\\npeople are always ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\nshe turned back to the door, opened it, and called out:  \\\"nastasia!\\\"\\n\\nthe ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared, and archer heard madame\\nolenska say, in an italian that she seemed to pronounce with\\nintentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it:\\n\\\"here--throw this into the dustbin!\\\" and then, as nastasia stared\\nprotestingly:  \\\"but no--it's not the fault of the poor flowers.  tell\\nthe boy to carry them to the house three doors away, the house of mr.\\nwinsett, the dark gentleman who dined here.  his wife is ill--they may\\ngive her pleasure ... the boy is out, you say?  then, my dear one, run\\nyourself; here, put my cloak over you and fly.  i want the thing out of\\nthe house immediately!  and, as you live, don't say they come from me!\\\"\\n\\nshe flung her velvet opera cloak over the maid's shoulders and turned\\nback into the drawing-room, shutting the door sharply.  her bosom was\\nrising high under its lace, and for a moment archer thought she was\\nabout to cry; but she burst into a laugh instead, and looking from the\\nmarchioness to archer, asked abruptly: \\\"and you two--have you made\\nfriends!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's for mr. archer to say, darling; he has waited patiently while you\\nwere dressing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes--i gave you time enough: my hair wouldn't go,\\\" madame olenska\\nsaid, raising her hand to the heaped-up curls of her chignon.  \\\"but\\nthat reminds me: i see dr. carver is gone, and you'll be late at the\\nblenkers'.  mr. archer, will you put my aunt in the carriage?\\\"\\n\\nshe followed the marchioness into the hall, saw her fitted into a\\nmiscellaneous heap of overshoes, shawls and tippets, and called from\\nthe doorstep:  \\\"mind, the carriage is to be back for me at ten!\\\"  then\\nshe returned to the drawing-room, where archer, on re-entering it,\\nfound her standing by the mantelpiece, examining herself in the mirror.\\nit was not usual, in new york society, for a lady to address her\\nparlour-maid as \\\"my dear one,\\\" and send her out on an errand wrapped in\\nher own opera-cloak; and archer, through all his deeper feelings,\\ntasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action\\nfollowed on emotion with such olympian speed.\\n\\nmadame olenska did not move when he came up behind her, and for a\\nsecond their eyes met in the mirror; then she turned, threw herself\\ninto her sofa-corner, and sighed out:  \\\"there's time for a cigarette.\\\"\\n\\nhe handed her the box and lit a spill for her; and as the flame flashed\\nup into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said:  \\\"what\\ndo you think of me in a temper?\\\"\\n\\narcher paused a moment; then he answered with sudden resolution:  \\\"it\\nmakes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i knew she'd been talking about me.  well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"she said you were used to all kinds of things--splendours and\\namusements and excitements--that we could never hope to give you here.\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips.\\n\\n\\\"medora is incorrigibly romantic.  it has made up to her for so many\\nthings!\\\"\\n\\narcher hesitated again, and again took his risk.  \\\"is your aunt's\\nromanticism always consistent with accuracy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you mean: does she speak the truth?\\\"  her niece considered.  \\\"well,\\ni'll tell you: in almost everything she says, there's something true\\nand something untrue.  but why do you ask?  what has she been telling\\nyou?\\\"\\n\\nhe looked away into the fire, and then back at her shining presence.\\nhis heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening\\nby that fireside, and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry\\nher away.\\n\\n\\\"she says--she pretends that count olenski has asked her to persuade\\nyou to go back to him.\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska made no answer.  she sat motionless, holding her\\ncigarette in her half-lifted hand.  the expression of her face had not\\nchanged; and archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent\\nincapacity for surprise.\\n\\n\\\"you knew, then?\\\" he broke out.\\n\\nshe was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette.\\nshe brushed it to the floor.  \\\"she has hinted about a letter: poor\\ndarling!  medora's hints--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"is it at your husband's request that she has arrived here suddenly?\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska seemed to consider this question also.  \\\"there again:\\none can't tell.  she told me she had had a 'spiritual summons,'\\nwhatever that is, from dr. carver.  i'm afraid she's going to marry dr.\\ncarver ...  poor medora, there's always some one she wants to marry.\\nbut perhaps the people in cuba just got tired of her!  i think she was\\nwith them as a sort of paid companion.  really, i don't know why she\\ncame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but you do believe she has a letter from your husband?\\\"\\n\\nagain madame olenska brooded silently; then she said:  \\\"after all, it\\nwas to be expected.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace.  a sudden\\nrestlessness possessed him, and he was tongue-tied by the sense that\\ntheir minutes were numbered, and that at any moment he might hear the\\nwheels of the returning carriage.\\n\\n\\\"you know that your aunt believes you will go back?\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska raised her head quickly.  a deep blush rose to her face\\nand spread over her neck and shoulders.  she blushed seldom and\\npainfully, as if it hurt her like a burn.\\n\\n\\\"many cruel things have been believed of me,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"oh, ellen--forgive me; i'm a fool and a brute!\\\"\\n\\nshe smiled a little.  \\\"you are horribly nervous; you have your own\\ntroubles.  i know you think the wellands are unreasonable about your\\nmarriage, and of course i agree with you.  in europe people don't\\nunderstand our long american engagements; i suppose they are not as\\ncalm as we are.\\\"  she pronounced the \\\"we\\\" with a faint emphasis that\\ngave it an ironic sound.\\n\\narcher felt the irony but did not dare to take it up.  after all, she\\nhad perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs,\\nand after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that\\nall he could do was to follow her lead.  but the sense of the waning\\nhour made him desperate: he could not bear the thought that a barrier\\nof words should drop between them again.\\n\\n\\\"yes,\\\" he said abruptly; \\\"i went south to ask may to marry me after\\neaster.  there's no reason why we shouldn't be married then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and may adores you--and yet you couldn't convince her?  i thought her\\ntoo intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"she is too intelligent--she's not their slave.\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska looked at him.  \\\"well, then--i don't understand.\\\"\\n\\narcher reddened, and hurried on with a rush.  \\\"we had a frank\\ntalk--almost the first.  she thinks my impatience a bad sign.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"merciful heavens--a bad sign?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"she thinks it means that i can't trust myself to go on caring for her.\\nshe thinks, in short, i want to marry her at once to get away from some\\none that i--care for more.\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska examined this curiously.  \\\"but if she thinks that--why\\nisn't she in a hurry too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"because she's not like that: she's so much nobler.  she insists all\\nthe more on the long engagement, to give me time--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"time to give her up for the other woman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"if i want to.\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed\\neyes.  down the quiet street archer heard the approaching trot of her\\nhorses.\\n\\n\\\"that is noble,\\\" she said, with a slight break in her voice.\\n\\n\\\"yes.  but it's ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ridiculous?  because you don't care for any one else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"because i don't mean to marry any one else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah.\\\"  there was another long interval.  at length she looked up at him\\nand asked:  \\\"this other woman--does she love you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, there's no other woman; i mean, the person that may was thinking\\nof is--was never--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"then, why, after all, are you in such haste?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"there's your carriage,\\\" said archer.\\n\\nshe half-rose and looked about her with absent eyes.  her fan and\\ngloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically.\\n\\n\\\"yes; i suppose i must be going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you're going to mrs. struthers's?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"  she smiled and added:  \\\"i must go where i am invited, or i\\nshould be too lonely.  why not come with me?\\\"\\n\\narcher felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him, must make her\\ngive him the rest of her evening.  ignoring her question, he continued\\nto lean against the chimney-piece, his eyes fixed on the hand in which\\nshe held her gloves and fan, as if watching to see if he had the power\\nto make her drop them.\\n\\n\\\"may guessed the truth,\\\" he said.  \\\"there is another woman--but not the\\none she thinks.\\\"\\n\\nellen olenska made no answer, and did not move.  after a moment he sat\\ndown beside her, and, taking her hand, softly unclasped it, so that the\\ngloves and fan fell on the sofa between them.\\n\\nshe started up, and freeing herself from him moved away to the other\\nside of the hearth.  \\\"ah, don't make love to me!  too many people have\\ndone that,\\\" she said, frowning.\\n\\narcher, changing colour, stood up also: it was the bitterest rebuke she\\ncould have given him.  \\\"i have never made love to you,\\\" he said, \\\"and i\\nnever shall.  but you are the woman i would have married if it had been\\npossible for either of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"possible for either of us?\\\"  she looked at him with unfeigned\\nastonishment.  \\\"and you say that--when it's you who've made it\\nimpossible?\\\"\\n\\nhe stared at her, groping in a blackness through which a single arrow\\nof light tore its blinding way.\\n\\n\\\"i've made it impossible--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you, you, you!\\\" she cried, her lip trembling like a child's on the\\nverge of tears.  \\\"isn't it you who made me give up divorcing--give it\\nup because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was, how one must\\nsacrifice one's self to preserve the dignity of marriage ... and to\\nspare one's family the publicity, the scandal?  and because my family\\nwas going to be your family--for may's sake and for yours--i did what\\nyou told me, what you proved to me that i ought to do.  ah,\\\" she broke\\nout with a sudden laugh, \\\"i've made no secret of having done it for\\nyou!\\\"\\n\\nshe sank down on the sofa again, crouching among the festive ripples of\\nher dress like a stricken masquerader; and the young man stood by the\\nfireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving.\\n\\n\\\"good god,\\\" he groaned.  \\\"when i thought--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you thought?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, don't ask me what i thought!\\\"\\n\\nstill looking at her, he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck\\nto her face.  she sat upright, facing him with a rigid dignity.\\n\\n\\\"i do ask you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, then: there were things in that letter you asked me to read--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"my husband's letter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i had nothing to fear from that letter: absolutely nothing!  all i\\nfeared was to bring notoriety, scandal, on the family--on you and may.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"good god,\\\" he groaned again, bowing his face in his hands.\\n\\nthe silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final\\nand irrevocable.  it seemed to archer to be crushing him down like his\\nown grave-stone; in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever\\nlift that load from his heart.  he did not move from his place, or\\nraise his head from his hands; his hidden eyeballs went on staring into\\nutter darkness.\\n\\n\\\"at least i loved you--\\\" he brought out.\\n\\non the other side of the hearth, from the sofa-corner where he supposed\\nthat she still crouched, he heard a faint stifled crying like a\\nchild's.  he started up and came to her side.\\n\\n\\\"ellen!  what madness!  why are you crying?  nothing's done that can't\\nbe undone.  i'm still free, and you're going to be.\\\"  he had her in his\\narms, her face like a wet flower at his lips, and all their vain\\nterrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise.  the one thing that\\nastonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes\\narguing with her across the width of the room, when just touching her\\nmade everything so simple.\\n\\nshe gave him back all his kiss, but after a moment he felt her\\nstiffening in his arms, and she put him aside and stood up.\\n\\n\\\"ah, my poor newland--i suppose this had to be.  but it doesn't in the\\nleast alter things,\\\" she said, looking down at him in her turn from the\\nhearth.\\n\\n\\\"it alters the whole of life for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no, no--it mustn't, it can't.  you're engaged to may welland; and i'm\\nmarried.\\\"\\n\\nhe stood up too, flushed and resolute.  \\\"nonsense!  it's too late for\\nthat sort of thing.  we've no right to lie to other people or to\\nourselves.  we won't talk of your marriage; but do you see me marrying\\nmay after this?\\\"\\n\\nshe stood silent, resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece, her\\nprofile reflected in the glass behind her.  one of the locks of her\\nchignon had become loosened and hung on her neck; she looked haggard\\nand almost old.\\n\\n\\\"i don't see you,\\\" she said at length, \\\"putting that question to may.\\ndo you?\\\"\\n\\nhe gave a reckless shrug.  \\\"it's too late to do anything else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you say that because it's the easiest thing to say at this moment--not\\nbecause it's true.  in reality it's too late to do anything but what\\nwe'd both decided on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, i don't understand you!\\\"\\n\\nshe forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing\\nit.  \\\"you don't understand because you haven't yet guessed how you've\\nchanged things for me: oh, from the first--long before i knew all you'd\\ndone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"all i'd done?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.  i was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy\\nof me--that they thought i was a dreadful sort of person.  it seems\\nthey had even refused to meet me at dinner.  i found that out\\nafterward; and how you'd made your mother go with you to the van der\\nluydens'; and how you'd insisted on announcing your engagement at the\\nbeaufort ball, so that i might have two families to stand by me instead\\nof one--\\\"\\n\\nat that he broke into a laugh.\\n\\n\\\"just imagine,\\\" she said, \\\"how stupid and unobservant i was!  i knew\\nnothing of all this till granny blurted it out one day.  new york\\nsimply meant peace and freedom to me: it was coming home.  and i was so\\nhappy at being among my own people that every one i met seemed kind and\\ngood, and glad to see me.  but from the very beginning,\\\" she continued,\\n\\\"i felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons\\nthat i understood for doing what at first seemed so hard\\nand--unnecessary.  the very good people didn't convince me; i felt\\nthey'd never been tempted.  but you knew; you understood; you had felt\\nthe world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands--and yet you\\nhated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by\\ndisloyalty and cruelty and indifference.  that was what i'd never known\\nbefore--and it's better than anything i've known.\\\"\\n\\nshe spoke in a low even voice, without tears or visible agitation; and\\neach word, as it dropped from her, fell into his breast like burning\\nlead.  he sat bowed over, his head between his hands, staring at the\\nhearthrug, and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her\\ndress.  suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe.\\n\\nshe bent over him, laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking at\\nhim with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze.\\n\\n\\\"ah, don't let us undo what you've done!\\\" she cried.  \\\"i can't go back\\nnow to that other way of thinking.  i can't love you unless i give you\\nup.\\\"\\n\\nhis arms were yearning up to her; but she drew away, and they remained\\nfacing each other, divided by the distance that her words had created.\\nthen, abruptly, his anger overflowed.\\n\\n\\\"and beaufort?  is he to replace me?\\\"\\n\\nas the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of\\nanger; and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own.  but madame\\nolenska only grew a shade paler, and stood with her arms hanging down\\nbefore her, and her head slightly bent, as her way was when she\\npondered a question.\\n\\n\\\"he's waiting for you now at mrs. struthers's; why don't you go to\\nhim?\\\" archer sneered.\\n\\nshe turned to ring the bell.  \\\"i shall not go out this evening; tell\\nthe carriage to go and fetch the signora marchesa,\\\" she said when the\\nmaid came.\\n\\nafter the door had closed again archer continued to look at her with\\nbitter eyes.  \\\"why this sacrifice?  since you tell me that you're\\nlonely i've no right to keep you from your friends.\\\"\\n\\nshe smiled a little under her wet lashes.  \\\"i shan't be lonely now.  i\\nwas lonely; i was afraid.  but the emptiness and the darkness are gone;\\nwhen i turn back into myself now i'm like a child going at night into a\\nroom where there's always a light.\\\"\\n\\nher tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility,\\nand archer groaned out again:  \\\"i don't understand you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yet you understand may!\\\"\\n\\nhe reddened under the retort, but kept his eyes on her.  \\\"may is ready\\nto give me up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what!  three days after you've entreated her on your knees to hasten\\nyour marriage?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"she's refused; that gives me the right--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, you've taught me what an ugly word that is,\\\" she said.\\n\\nhe turned away with a sense of utter weariness.  he felt as though he\\nhad been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice, and\\nnow, just as he had fought his way to the top, his hold had given way\\nand he was pitching down headlong into darkness.\\n\\nif he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her\\narguments; but she still held him at a distance by something\\ninscrutably aloof in her look and attitude, and by his own awed sense\\nof her sincerity.  at length he began to plead again.\\n\\n\\\"if we do this now it will be worse afterward--worse for every one--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no--no--no!\\\" she almost screamed, as if he frightened her.\\n\\nat that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house.  they had\\nheard no carriage stopping at the door, and they stood motionless,\\nlooking at each other with startled eyes.\\n\\noutside, nastasia's step crossed the hall, the outer door opened, and a\\nmoment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the\\ncountess olenska.\\n\\n\\\"the lady was very happy at the flowers,\\\" nastasia said, smoothing her\\napron.  \\\"she thought it was her signor marito who had sent them, and\\nshe cried a little and said it was a folly.\\\"\\n\\nher mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope.  she tore it open and\\ncarried it to the lamp; then, when the door had closed again, she\\nhanded the telegram to archer.\\n\\nit was dated from st. augustine, and addressed to the countess olenska.\\nin it he read:  \\\"granny's telegram successful.  papa and mamma agree\\nmarriage after easter.  am telegraphing newland.  am too happy for\\nwords and love you dearly.  your grateful may.\\\"\\n\\n\\nhalf an hour later, when archer unlocked his own front-door, he found a\\nsimilar envelope on the hall-table on top of his pile of notes and\\nletters.  the message inside the envelope was also from may welland,\\nand ran as follows:  \\\"parents consent wedding tuesday after easter at\\ntwelve grace church eight bridesmaids please see rector so happy love\\nmay.\\\"\\n\\narcher crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate\\nthe news it contained.  then he pulled out a small pocket-diary and\\nturned over the pages with trembling fingers; but he did not find what\\nhe wanted, and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the\\nstairs.\\n\\na light was shining through the door of the little hall-room which\\nserved janey as a dressing-room and boudoir, and her brother rapped\\nimpatiently on the panel.  the door opened, and his sister stood before\\nhim in her immemorial purple flannel dressing-gown, with her hair \\\"on\\npins.\\\"  her face looked pale and apprehensive.\\n\\n\\\"newland!  i hope there's no bad news in that telegram?  i waited on\\npurpose, in case--\\\"  (no item of his correspondence was safe from\\njaney.)\\n\\nhe took no notice of her question.  \\\"look here--what day is easter this\\nyear?\\\"\\n\\nshe looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance.  \\\"easter?  newland!\\nwhy, of course, the first week in april.  why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the first week?\\\"  he turned again to the pages of his diary,\\ncalculating rapidly under his breath.  \\\"the first week, did you say?\\\"\\nhe threw back his head with a long laugh.\\n\\n\\\"for mercy's sake what's the matter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"nothing's the matter, except that i'm going to be married in a month.\\\"\\n\\njaney fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast.\\n\\\"oh newland, how wonderful!  i'm so glad!  but, dearest, why do you\\nkeep on laughing?  do hush, or you'll wake mamma.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbook ii\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full of dust.  all the old\\nladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing\\nermines, and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered\\nthe faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar.\\n\\nnewland archer, at a signal from the sexton, had come out of the vestry\\nand placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of grace\\nchurch.\\n\\nthe signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was\\nin sight; but there was sure to be a considerable interval of\\nadjustment and consultation in the lobby, where the bridesmaids were\\nalready hovering like a cluster of easter blossoms.  during this\\nunavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom, in proof of his eagerness,\\nwas expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled\\ncompany; and archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as\\nthrough all the others which made of a nineteenth century new york\\nwedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history.\\neverything was equally easy--or equally painful, as one chose to put\\nit--in the path he was committed to tread, and he had obeyed the\\nflurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms\\nhad obeyed his own, in the days when he had guided them through the\\nsame labyrinth.\\n\\nso far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations.\\nthe bridesmaids' eight bouquets of white lilac and lilies-of-the-valley\\nhad been sent in due time, as well as the gold and sapphire\\nsleeve-links of the eight ushers and the best man's cat's-eye\\nscarf-pin; archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording\\nof his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and\\nex-lady-loves; the fees for the bishop and the rector were safely in\\nthe pocket of his best man; his own luggage was already at mrs. manson\\nmingott's, where the wedding-breakfast was to take place, and so were\\nthe travelling clothes into which he was to change; and a private\\ncompartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young\\ncouple to their unknown destination--concealment of the spot in which\\nthe bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of\\nthe prehistoric ritual.\\n\\n\\\"got the ring all right?\\\" whispered young van der luyden newland, who\\nwas inexperienced in the duties of a best man, and awed by the weight\\nof his responsibility.\\n\\narcher made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make:\\nwith his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey\\nwaistcoat, and assured himself that the little gold circlet (engraved\\ninside: newland to may, april ---, 187-) was in its place; then,\\nresuming his former attitude, his tall hat and pearl-grey gloves with\\nblack stitchings grasped in his left hand, he stood looking at the door\\nof the church.\\n\\noverhead, handel's march swelled pompously through the imitation stone\\nvaulting, carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at\\nwhich, with cheerful indifference, he had stood on the same chancel\\nstep watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms.\\n\\n\\\"how like a first night at the opera!\\\" he thought, recognising all the\\nsame faces in the same boxes (no, pews), and wondering if, when the\\nlast trump sounded, mrs. selfridge merry would be there with the same\\ntowering ostrich feathers in her bonnet, and mrs. beaufort with the\\nsame diamond earrings and the same smile--and whether suitable\\nproscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world.\\n\\nafter that there was still time to review, one by one, the familiar\\ncountenances in the first rows; the women's sharp with curiosity and\\nexcitement, the men's sulky with the obligation of having to put on\\ntheir frock-coats before luncheon, and fight for food at the\\nwedding-breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"too bad the breakfast is at old catherine's,\\\" the bridegroom could\\nfancy reggie chivers saying.  \\\"but i'm told that lovell mingott\\ninsisted on its being cooked by his own chef, so it ought to be good if\\none can only get at it.\\\"  and he could imagine sillerton jackson adding\\nwith authority:  \\\"my dear fellow, haven't you heard?  it's to be served\\nat small tables, in the new english fashion.\\\"\\n\\narcher's eyes lingered a moment on the left-hand pew, where his mother,\\nwho had entered the church on mr. henry van der luyden's arm, sat\\nweeping softly under her chantilly veil, her hands in her grandmother's\\nermine muff.\\n\\n\\\"poor janey!\\\" he thought, looking at his sister, \\\"even by screwing her\\nhead around she can see only the people in the few front pews; and\\nthey're mostly dowdy newlands and dagonets.\\\"\\n\\non the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved\\nfor the families he saw beaufort, tall and redfaced, scrutinising the\\nwomen with his arrogant stare.  beside him sat his wife, all silvery\\nchinchilla and violets; and on the far side of the ribbon, lawrence\\nlefferts's sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the\\ninvisible deity of \\\"good form\\\" who presided at the ceremony.\\n\\narcher wondered how many flaws lefferts's keen eyes would discover in\\nthe ritual of his divinity; then he suddenly recalled that he too had\\nonce thought such questions important.  the things that had filled his\\ndays seemed now like a nursery parody of life, or like the wrangles of\\nmediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever\\nunderstood.  a stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents\\nshould be \\\"shown\\\" had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and\\nit seemed inconceivable to archer that grown-up people should work\\nthemselves into a state of agitation over such trifles, and that the\\nmatter should have been decided (in the negative) by mrs. welland's\\nsaying, with indignant tears:  \\\"i should as soon turn the reporters\\nloose in my house.\\\"  yet there was a time when archer had had definite\\nand rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when\\neverything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had\\nseemed to him fraught with world-wide significance.\\n\\n\\\"and all the while, i suppose,\\\" he thought, \\\"real people were living\\nsomewhere, and real things happening to them ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"there they come!\\\" breathed the best man excitedly; but the bridegroom\\nknew better.\\n\\nthe cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that mr.\\nbrown the livery-stable keeper (gowned in black in his intermittent\\ncharacter of sexton) was taking a preliminary survey of the scene\\nbefore marshalling his forces.  the door was softly shut again; then\\nafter another interval it swung majestically open, and a murmur ran\\nthrough the church:  \\\"the family!\\\"\\n\\nmrs. welland came first, on the arm of her eldest son.  her large pink\\nface was appropriately solemn, and her plum-coloured satin with pale\\nblue side-panels, and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met\\nwith general approval; but before she had settled herself with a\\nstately rustle in the pew opposite mrs. archer's the spectators were\\ncraning their necks to see who was coming after her.  wild rumours had\\nbeen abroad the day before to the effect that mrs. manson mingott, in\\nspite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on being present at\\nthe ceremony; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting\\ncharacter that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk\\nup the nave and squeeze into a seat.  it was known that she had\\ninsisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of\\ntaking down the end panel of the front pew, and to measure the space\\nbetween the seat and the front; but the result had been discouraging,\\nand for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the\\nplan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous bath chair and\\nsitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel.\\n\\nthe idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her\\nrelations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person\\nwho suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the\\niron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the\\ncurbstone.  the idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the\\nbride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood\\noutside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even\\nold catherine's courage, though for a moment she had weighed the\\npossibility.  \\\"why, they might take a photograph of my child and put it\\nin the papers!\\\" mrs. welland exclaimed when her mother's last plan was\\nhinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled\\nwith a collective shudder.  the ancestress had had to give in; but her\\nconcession was bought only by the promise that the wedding-breakfast\\nshould take place under her roof, though (as the washington square\\nconnection said) with the wellands' house in easy reach it was hard to\\nhave to make a special price with brown to drive one to the other end\\nof nowhere.\\n\\nthough all these transactions had been widely reported by the jacksons\\na sporting minority still clung to the belief that old catherine would\\nappear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature\\nwhen she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law.  mrs.\\nlovell mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies\\nof her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress; but\\nonce the disappointment occasioned by her mother-in-law's\\nnon-appearance had subsided, it was agreed that her black chantilly\\nover lilac satin, with a bonnet of parma violets, formed the happiest\\ncontrast to mrs. welland's blue and plum-colour.  far different was the\\nimpression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on mr.\\nmingott's arm, in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and\\nfloating scarves; and as this last apparition glided into view archer's\\nheart contracted and stopped beating.\\n\\nhe had taken it for granted that the marchioness manson was still in\\nwashington, where she had gone some four weeks previously with her\\nniece, madame olenska.  it was generally understood that their abrupt\\ndeparture was due to madame olenska's desire to remove her aunt from\\nthe baleful eloquence of dr. agathon carver, who had nearly succeeded\\nin enlisting her as a recruit for the valley of love; and in the\\ncircumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for\\nthe wedding.  for a moment archer stood with his eyes fixed on medora's\\nfantastic figure, straining to see who came behind her; but the little\\nprocession was at an end, for all the lesser members of the family had\\ntaken their seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselves\\ntogether like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre,\\nwere already slipping through the side doors into the lobby.\\n\\n\\\"newland--i say: she's here!\\\" the best man whispered.\\n\\narcher roused himself with a start.\\n\\na long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating,\\nfor the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave, the\\nbishop, the rector and two white-winged assistants were hovering about\\nthe flower-banked altar, and the first chords of the spohr symphony\\nwere strewing their flower-like notes before the bride.\\n\\narcher opened his eyes (but could they really have been shut, as he\\nimagined?), and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task.  the\\nmusic, the scent of the lilies on the altar, the vision of the cloud of\\ntulle and orange-blossoms floating nearer and nearer, the sight of mrs.\\narcher's face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs, the low benedictory\\nmurmur of the rector's voice, the ordered evolutions of the eight pink\\nbridesmaids and the eight black ushers: all these sights, sounds and\\nsensations, so familiar in themselves, so unutterably strange and\\nmeaningless in his new relation to them, were confusedly mingled in his\\nbrain.\\n\\n\\\"my god,\\\" he thought, \\\"have i got the ring?\\\"--and once more he went\\nthrough the bridegroom's convulsive gesture.\\n\\nthen, in a moment, may was beside him, such radiance streaming from her\\nthat it sent a faint warmth through his numbness, and he straightened\\nhimself and smiled into her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"dearly beloved, we are gathered together here,\\\" the rector began ...\\n\\nthe ring was on her hand, the bishop's benediction had been given, the\\nbridesmaids were a-poise to resume their place in the procession, and\\nthe organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the\\nmendelssohn march, without which no newly-wedded couple had ever\\nemerged upon new york.\\n\\n\\\"your arm--i say, give her your arm!\\\" young newland nervously hissed;\\nand once more archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the\\nunknown.  what was it that had sent him there, he wondered?  perhaps\\nthe glimpse, among the anonymous spectators in the transept, of a dark\\ncoil of hair under a hat which, a moment later, revealed itself as\\nbelonging to an unknown lady with a long nose, so laughably unlike the\\nperson whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were\\nbecoming subject to hallucinations.\\n\\nand now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave, carried\\nforward on the light mendelssohn ripples, the spring day beckoning to\\nthem through widely opened doors, and mrs. welland's chestnuts, with\\nbig white favours on their frontlets, curvetting and showing off at the\\nfar end of the canvas tunnel.\\n\\nthe footman, who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel, wrapped\\nmay's white cloak about her, and archer jumped into the brougham at her\\nside.  she turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands\\nclasped under her veil.\\n\\n\\\"darling!\\\" archer said--and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before\\nhim and he felt himself sinking into it, deeper and deeper, while his\\nvoice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully:  \\\"yes, of course i thought\\ni'd lost the ring; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a\\nbridegroom didn't go through that.  but you did keep me waiting, you\\nknow!  i had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen.\\\"\\n\\nshe surprised him by turning, in full fifth avenue, and flinging her\\narms about his neck.  \\\"but none ever can happen now, can it, newland,\\nas long as we two are together?\\\"\\n\\n\\nevery detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the\\nyoung couple, after the wedding-breakfast, had ample time to put on\\ntheir travelling-clothes, descend the wide mingott stairs between\\nlaughing bridesmaids and weeping parents, and get into the brougham\\nunder the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers; and there was\\nstill half an hour left in which to drive to the station, buy the last\\nweeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers, and\\nsettle themselves in the reserved compartment in which may's maid had\\nalready placed her dove-coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new\\ndressing-bag from london.\\n\\nthe old du lac aunts at rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal\\nof the bridal couple, with a readiness inspired by the prospect of\\nspending a week in new york with mrs. archer; and archer, glad to\\nescape the usual \\\"bridal suite\\\" in a philadelphia or baltimore hotel,\\nhad accepted with an equal alacrity.\\n\\nmay was enchanted at the idea of going to the country, and childishly\\namused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where\\ntheir mysterious retreat was situated.  it was thought \\\"very english\\\"\\nto have a country-house lent to one, and the fact gave a last touch of\\ndistinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant\\nwedding of the year; but where the house was no one was permitted to\\nknow, except the parents of bride and groom, who, when taxed with the\\nknowledge, pursed their lips and said mysteriously:  \\\"ah, they didn't\\ntell us--\\\" which was manifestly true, since there was no need to.\\n\\nonce they were settled in their compartment, and the train, shaking off\\nthe endless wooden suburbs, had pushed out into the pale landscape of\\nspring, talk became easier than archer had expected.  may was still, in\\nlook and tone, the simple girl of yesterday, eager to compare notes\\nwith him as to the incidents of the wedding, and discussing them as\\nimpartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher.  at\\nfirst archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an\\ninward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil\\nunawareness.  she was alone for the first time with her husband; but\\nher husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday.  there was no\\none whom she liked as much, no one whom she trusted as completely, and\\nthe culminating \\\"lark\\\" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement\\nand marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey, like a grownup\\nperson, like a \\\"married woman,\\\" in fact.\\n\\nit was wonderful that--as he had learned in the mission garden at st.\\naugustine--such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of\\nimagination.  but he remembered how, even then, she had surprised him\\nby dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience\\nhad been eased of its burden; and he saw that she would probably go\\nthrough life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as\\nit came, but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance.\\n\\nperhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their\\ntransparency, and her face the look of representing a type rather than\\na person; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a civic virtue\\nor a greek goddess.  the blood that ran so close to her fair skin might\\nhave been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element; yet her\\nlook of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor\\ndull, but only primitive and pure.  in the thick of this meditation\\narcher suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a\\nstranger, and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding-breakfast and\\nof granny mingott's immense and triumphant pervasion of it.\\n\\nmay settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject.  \\\"i was surprised,\\nthough--weren't you?--that aunt medora came after all.  ellen wrote\\nthat they were neither of them well enough to take the journey; i do\\nwish it had been she who had recovered!  did you see the exquisite old\\nlace she sent me?\\\"\\n\\nhe had known that the moment must come sooner or later, but he had\\nsomewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay.\\n\\n\\\"yes--i--no: yes, it was beautiful,\\\" he said, looking at her blindly,\\nand wondering if, whenever he heard those two syllables, all his\\ncarefully built-up world would tumble about him like a house of cards.\\n\\n\\\"aren't you tired?  it will be good to have some tea when we\\narrive--i'm sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready,\\\" he\\nrattled on, taking her hand in his; and her mind rushed away instantly\\nto the magnificent tea and coffee service of baltimore silver which the\\nbeauforts had sent, and which \\\"went\\\" so perfectly with uncle lovell\\nmingott's trays and side-dishes.\\n\\nin the spring twilight the train stopped at the rhinebeck station, and\\nthey walked along the platform to the waiting carriage.\\n\\n\\\"ah, how awfully kind of the van der luydens--they've sent their man\\nover from skuytercliff to meet us,\\\" archer exclaimed, as a sedate\\nperson out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags.\\n\\n\\\"i'm extremely sorry, sir,\\\" said this emissary, \\\"that a little accident\\nhas occurred at the miss du lacs': a leak in the water-tank.  it\\nhappened yesterday, and mr. van der luyden, who heard of it this\\nmorning, sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the patroon's\\nhouse ready.  it will be quite comfortable, i think you'll find, sir;\\nand the miss du lacs have sent their cook over, so that it will be\\nexactly the same as if you'd been at rhinebeck.\\\"\\n\\narcher stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more\\napologetic accents:  \\\"it'll be exactly the same, sir, i do assure\\nyou--\\\" and may's eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed\\nsilence:  \\\"the same as rhinebeck?  the patroon's house?  but it will be\\na hundred thousand times better--won't it, newland?  it's too dear and\\nkind of mr. van der luyden to have thought of it.\\\"\\n\\nand as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their\\nshining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly:\\n\\\"only fancy, i've never been inside it--have you?  the van der luydens\\nshow it to so few people.  but they opened it for ellen, it seems, and\\nshe told me what a darling little place it was: she says it's the only\\nhouse she's seen in america that she could imagine being perfectly\\nhappy in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--that's what we're going to be, isn't it?\\\" cried her husband\\ngaily; and she answered with her boyish smile:  \\\"ah, it's just our luck\\nbeginning--the wonderful luck we're always going to have together!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"of course we must dine with mrs. carfry, dearest,\\\" archer said; and\\nhis wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental\\nbritannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table.\\n\\nin all the rainy desert of autumnal london there were only two people\\nwhom the newland archers knew; and these two they had sedulously\\navoided, in conformity with the old new york tradition that it was not\\n\\\"dignified\\\" to force one's self on the notice of one's acquaintances in\\nforeign countries.\\n\\nmrs. archer and janey, in the course of their visits to europe, had so\\nunflinchingly lived up to this principle, and met the friendly advances\\nof their fellow-travellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve,\\nthat they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a\\nword with a \\\"foreigner\\\" other than those employed in hotels and\\nrailway-stations.  their own compatriots--save those previously known\\nor properly accredited--they treated with an even more pronounced\\ndisdain; so that, unless they ran across a chivers, a dagonet or a\\nmingott, their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete-a-tete.\\nbut the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing; and one night at\\nbotzen one of the two english ladies in the room across the passage\\n(whose names, dress and social situation were already intimately known\\nto janey) had knocked on the door and asked if mrs. archer had a bottle\\nof liniment.  the other lady--the intruder's sister, mrs. carfry--had\\nbeen seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis; and mrs. archer, who\\nnever travelled without a complete family pharmacy, was fortunately\\nable to produce the required remedy.\\n\\nmrs. carfry was very ill, and as she and her sister miss harle were\\ntravelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the archer ladies,\\nwho supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid\\nhelped to nurse the invalid back to health.\\n\\nwhen the archers left botzen they had no idea of ever seeing mrs.\\ncarfry and miss harle again.  nothing, to mrs. archer's mind, would\\nhave been more \\\"undignified\\\" than to force one's self on the notice of\\na \\\"foreigner\\\" to whom one had happened to render an accidental service.\\nbut mrs. carfry and her sister, to whom this point of view was unknown,\\nand who would have found it utterly incomprehensible, felt themselves\\nlinked by an eternal gratitude to the \\\"delightful americans\\\" who had\\nbeen so kind at botzen.  with touching fidelity they seized every\\nchance of meeting mrs. archer and janey in the course of their\\ncontinental travels, and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding\\nout when they were to pass through london on their way to or from the\\nstates.  the intimacy became indissoluble, and mrs. archer and janey,\\nwhenever they alighted at brown's hotel, found themselves awaited by\\ntwo affectionate friends who, like themselves, cultivated ferns in\\nwardian cases, made macrame lace, read the memoirs of the baroness\\nbunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading london pulpits.\\nas mrs. archer said, it made \\\"another thing of london\\\" to know mrs.\\ncarfry and miss harle; and by the time that newland became engaged the\\ntie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought\\n\\\"only right\\\" to send a wedding invitation to the two english ladies,\\nwho sent, in return, a pretty bouquet of pressed alpine flowers under\\nglass.  and on the dock, when newland and his wife sailed for england,\\nmrs. archer's last word had been:  \\\"you must take may to see mrs.\\ncarfry.\\\"\\n\\nnewland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction; but\\nmrs. carfry, with her usual acuteness, had run them down and sent them\\nan invitation to dine; and it was over this invitation that may archer\\nwas wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins.\\n\\n\\\"it's all very well for you, newland; you know them.  but i shall feel\\nso shy among a lot of people i've never met.  and what shall i wear?\\\"\\n\\nnewland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her.  she looked\\nhandsomer and more diana-like than ever.  the moist english air seemed\\nto have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight\\nhardness of her virginal features; or else it was simply the inner glow\\nof happiness, shining through like a light under ice.\\n\\n\\\"wear, dearest?  i thought a trunkful of things had come from paris\\nlast week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes, of course.  i meant to say that i shan't know which to wear.\\\"\\nshe pouted a little.  \\\"i've never dined out in london; and i don't want\\nto be ridiculous.\\\"\\n\\nhe tried to enter into her perplexity.  \\\"but don't englishwomen dress\\njust like everybody else in the evening?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"newland!  how can you ask such funny questions?  when they go to the\\ntheatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, perhaps they wear new ball-dresses at home; but at any rate mrs.\\ncarfry and miss harle won't.  they'll wear caps like my mother's--and\\nshawls; very soft shawls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes; but how will the other women be dressed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"not as well as you, dear,\\\" he rejoined, wondering what had suddenly\\ndeveloped in her janey's morbid interest in clothes.\\n\\nshe pushed back her chair with a sigh.  \\\"that's dear of you, newland;\\nbut it doesn't help me much.\\\"\\n\\nhe had an inspiration.  \\\"why not wear your wedding-dress?  that can't\\nbe wrong, can it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, dearest!  if i only had it here!  but it's gone to paris to be\\nmade over for next winter, and worth hasn't sent it back.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, well--\\\" said archer, getting up.  \\\"look here--the fog's lifting.\\nif we made a dash for the national gallery we might manage to catch a\\nglimpse of the pictures.\\\"\\n\\n\\nthe newland archers were on their way home, after a three months'\\nwedding-tour which may, in writing to her girl friends, vaguely\\nsummarised as \\\"blissful.\\\"\\n\\nthey had not gone to the italian lakes: on reflection, archer had not\\nbeen able to picture his wife in that particular setting.  her own\\ninclination (after a month with the paris dressmakers) was for\\nmountaineering in july and swimming in august.  this plan they\\npunctually fulfilled, spending july at interlaken and grindelwald, and\\naugust at a little place called etretat, on the normandy coast, which\\nsome one had recommended as quaint and quiet.  once or twice, in the\\nmountains, archer had pointed southward and said: \\\"there's italy\\\"; and\\nmay, her feet in a gentian-bed, had smiled cheerfully, and replied:\\n\\\"it would be lovely to go there next winter, if only you didn't have to\\nbe in new york.\\\"\\n\\nbut in reality travelling interested her even less than he had\\nexpected.  she regarded it (once her clothes were ordered) as merely an\\nenlarged opportunity for walking, riding, swimming, and trying her hand\\nat the fascinating new game of lawn tennis; and when they finally got\\nback to london (where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered\\nhis clothes) she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she\\nlooked forward to sailing.\\n\\nin london nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops; and\\nshe found the theatres less exciting than the paris cafes chantants\\nwhere, under the blossoming horse-chestnuts of the champs elysees, she\\nhad had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant\\nterrace on an audience of \\\"cocottes,\\\" and having her husband interpret\\nto her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears.\\n\\narcher had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage.  it\\nwas less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat may exactly as\\nall his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice\\nthe theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied.\\nthere was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest\\nnotion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that\\nmay's only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be\\nto lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.  her innate dignity\\nwould always keep her from making the gift abjectly; and a day might\\neven come (as it once had) when she would find strength to take it\\naltogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good.  but\\nwith a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers\\nsuch a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly\\noutrageous in his own conduct; and the fineness of her feeling for him\\nmade that unthinkable.  whatever happened, he knew, she would always be\\nloyal, gallant and unresentful; and that pledged him to the practice of\\nthe same virtues.\\n\\nall this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind.  if her\\nsimplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed\\nand rebelled; but since the lines of her character, though so few, were\\non the same fine mould as her face, she became the tutelary divinity of\\nall his old traditions and reverences.\\n\\nsuch qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel,\\nthough they made her so easy and pleasant a companion; but he saw at\\nonce how they would fall into place in their proper setting.  he had no\\nfear of being oppressed by them, for his artistic and intellectual life\\nwould go on, as it always had, outside the domestic circle; and within\\nit there would be nothing small and stifling--coming back to his wife\\nwould never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open.\\nand when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would\\nbe filled.\\n\\nall these things went through his mind during their long slow drive\\nfrom mayfair to south kensington, where mrs. carfry and her sister\\nlived.  archer too would have preferred to escape their friends'\\nhospitality: in conformity with the family tradition he had always\\ntravelled as a sight-seer and looker-on, affecting a haughty\\nunconsciousness of the presence of his fellow-beings.  once only, just\\nafter harvard, he had spent a few gay weeks at florence with a band of\\nqueer europeanised americans, dancing all night with titled ladies in\\npalaces, and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the\\nfashionable club; but it had all seemed to him, though the greatest fun\\nin the world, as unreal as a carnival.  these queer cosmopolitan women,\\ndeep in complicated love-affairs which they appeared to feel the need\\nof retailing to every one they met, and the magnificent young officers\\nand elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their\\nconfidences, were too different from the people archer had grown up\\namong, too much like expensive and rather malodorous hot-house exotics,\\nto detain his imagination long.  to introduce his wife into such a\\nsociety was out of the question; and in the course of his travels no\\nother had shown any marked eagerness for his company.\\n\\nnot long after their arrival in london he had run across the duke of\\nst. austrey, and the duke, instantly and cordially recognising him, had\\nsaid:  \\\"look me up, won't you?\\\"--but no proper-spirited american would\\nhave considered that a suggestion to be acted on, and the meeting was\\nwithout a sequel.  they had even managed to avoid may's english aunt,\\nthe banker's wife, who was still in yorkshire; in fact, they had\\npurposely postponed going to london till the autumn in order that their\\narrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to\\nthese unknown relatives.\\n\\n\\\"probably there'll be nobody at mrs. carfry's--london's a desert at\\nthis season, and you've made yourself much too beautiful,\\\" archer said\\nto may, who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her\\nsky-blue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her\\nto the london grime.\\n\\n\\\"i don't want them to think that we dress like savages,\\\" she replied,\\nwith a scorn that pocahontas might have resented; and he was struck\\nagain by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly american\\nwomen for the social advantages of dress.\\n\\n\\\"it's their armour,\\\" he thought, \\\"their defence against the unknown,\\nand their defiance of it.\\\"  and he understood for the first time the\\nearnestness with which may, who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her\\nhair to charm him, had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and\\nordering her extensive wardrobe.\\n\\nhe had been right in expecting the party at mrs. carfry's to be a small\\none.  besides their hostess and her sister, they found, in the long\\nchilly drawing-room, only another shawled lady, a genial vicar who was\\nher husband, a silent lad whom mrs. carfry named as her nephew, and a\\nsmall dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor,\\npronouncing a french name as she did so.\\n\\ninto this dimly-lit and dim-featured group may archer floated like a\\nswan with the sunset on her: she seemed larger, fairer, more\\nvoluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her; and he\\nperceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an\\nextreme and infantile shyness.\\n\\n\\\"what on earth will they expect me to talk about?\\\" her helpless eyes\\nimplored him, at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was\\ncalling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms.  but beauty, even\\nwhen distrustful of itself, awakens confidence in the manly heart; and\\nthe vicar and the french-named tutor were soon manifesting to may their\\ndesire to put her at her ease.\\n\\nin spite of their best efforts, however, the dinner was a languishing\\naffair.  archer noticed that his wife's way of showing herself at her\\nease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her\\nreferences, so that, though her loveliness was an encouragement to\\nadmiration, her conversation was a chill to repartee.  the vicar soon\\nabandoned the struggle; but the tutor, who spoke the most fluent and\\naccomplished english, gallantly continued to pour it out to her until\\nthe ladies, to the manifest relief of all concerned, went up to the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nthe vicar, after a glass of port, was obliged to hurry away to a\\nmeeting, and the shy nephew, who appeared to be an invalid, was packed\\noff to bed.  but archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine,\\nand suddenly archer found himself talking as he had not done since his\\nlast symposium with ned winsett.  the carfry nephew, it turned out, had\\nbeen threatened with consumption, and had had to leave harrow for\\nswitzerland, where he had spent two years in the milder air of lake\\nleman.  being a bookish youth, he had been entrusted to m. riviere, who\\nhad brought him back to england, and was to remain with him till he\\nwent up to oxford the following spring; and m. riviere added with\\nsimplicity that he should then have to look out for another job.\\n\\nit seemed impossible, archer thought, that he should be long without\\none, so varied were his interests and so many his gifts.  he was a man\\nof about thirty, with a thin ugly face (may would certainly have called\\nhim common-looking) to which the play of his ideas gave an intense\\nexpressiveness; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his\\nanimation.\\n\\nhis father, who had died young, had filled a small diplomatic post, and\\nit had been intended that the son should follow the same career; but an\\ninsatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism,\\nthen into authorship (apparently unsuccessful), and at length--after\\nother experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener--into\\ntutoring english youths in switzerland.  before that, however, he had\\nlived much in paris, frequented the goncourt grenier, been advised by\\nmaupassant not to attempt to write (even that seemed to archer a\\ndazzling honour!), and had often talked with merimee in his mother's\\nhouse.  he had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious\\n(having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for), and it was\\napparent that his literary ambitions had failed.  his situation, in\\nfact, seemed, materially speaking, no more brilliant than ned\\nwinsett's; but he had lived in a world in which, as he said, no one who\\nloved ideas need hunger mentally.  as it was precisely of that love\\nthat poor winsett was starving to death, archer looked with a sort of\\nvicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so\\nrichly in his poverty.\\n\\n\\\"you see, monsieur, it's worth everything, isn't it, to keep one's\\nintellectual liberty, not to enslave one's powers of appreciation,\\none's critical independence?  it was because of that that i abandoned\\njournalism, and took to so much duller work: tutoring and private\\nsecretaryship.  there is a good deal of drudgery, of course; but one\\npreserves one's moral freedom, what we call in french one's quant a\\nsoi.  and when one hears good talk one can join in it without\\ncompromising any opinions but one's own; or one can listen, and answer\\nit inwardly.  ah, good conversation--there's nothing like it, is there?\\nthe air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.  and so i have never\\nregretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism--two different forms\\nof the same self-abdication.\\\"  he fixed his vivid eyes on archer as he\\nlit another cigarette.  \\\"voyez-vous, monsieur, to be able to look life\\nin the face: that's worth living in a garret for, isn't it?  but, after\\nall, one must earn enough to pay for the garret; and i confess that to\\ngrow old as a private tutor--or a 'private' anything--is almost as\\nchilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at bucharest.\\nsometimes i feel i must make a plunge: an immense plunge.  do you\\nsuppose, for instance, there would be any opening for me in america--in\\nnew york?\\\"\\n\\narcher looked at him with startled eyes.  new york, for a young man who\\nhad frequented the goncourts and flaubert, and who thought the life of\\nideas the only one worth living!  he continued to stare at m.  riviere\\nperplexedly, wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and\\nadvantages would be the surest hindrance to success.\\n\\n\\\"new york--new york--but must it be especially new york?\\\" he stammered,\\nutterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could\\noffer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only\\nnecessity.\\n\\na sudden flush rose under m. riviere's sallow skin.  \\\"i--i thought it\\nyour metropolis: is not the intellectual life more active there?\\\" he\\nrejoined; then, as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of\\nhaving asked a favour, he went on hastily:  \\\"one throws out random\\nsuggestions--more to one's self than to others.  in reality, i see no\\nimmediate prospect--\\\" and rising from his seat he added, without a\\ntrace of constraint:  \\\"but mrs. carfry will think that i ought to be\\ntaking you upstairs.\\\"\\n\\nduring the homeward drive archer pondered deeply on this episode.  his\\nhour with m. riviere had put new air into his lungs, and his first\\nimpulse had been to invite him to dine the next day; but he was\\nbeginning to understand why married men did not always immediately\\nyield to their first impulses.\\n\\n\\\"that young tutor is an interesting fellow: we had some awfully good\\ntalk after dinner about books and things,\\\" he threw out tentatively in\\nthe hansom.\\n\\nmay roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had\\nread so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the\\nkey to them.\\n\\n\\\"the little frenchman?  wasn't he dreadfully common?\\\" she questioned\\ncoldly; and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at\\nhaving been invited out in london to meet a clergyman and a french\\ntutor.  the disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment\\nordinarily defined as snobbishness, but by old new york's sense of what\\nwas due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands.  if may's\\nparents had entertained the carfrys in fifth avenue they would have\\noffered them something more substantial than a parson and a\\nschoolmaster.\\n\\nbut archer was on edge, and took her up.\\n\\n\\\"common--common where?\\\" he queried; and she returned with unusual\\nreadiness:  \\\"why, i should say anywhere but in his school-room.  those\\npeople are always awkward in society.  but then,\\\" she added\\ndisarmingly, \\\"i suppose i shouldn't have known if he was clever.\\\"\\n\\narcher disliked her use of the word \\\"clever\\\" almost as much as her use\\nof the word \\\"common\\\"; but he was beginning to fear his tendency to\\ndwell on the things he disliked in her.  after all, her point of view\\nhad always been the same.  it was that of all the people he had grown\\nup among, and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible.\\nuntil a few months ago he had never known a \\\"nice\\\" woman who looked at\\nlife differently; and if a man married it must necessarily be among the\\nnice.\\n\\n\\\"ah--then i won't ask him to dine!\\\" he concluded with a laugh; and may\\nechoed, bewildered:  \\\"goodness--ask the carfrys' tutor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, not on the same day with the carfrys, if you prefer i shouldn't.\\nbut i did rather want another talk with him.  he's looking for a job in\\nnew york.\\\"\\n\\nher surprise increased with her indifference: he almost fancied that\\nshe suspected him of being tainted with \\\"foreignness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"a job in new york?  what sort of a job?  people don't have french\\ntutors: what does he want to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"chiefly to enjoy good conversation, i understand,\\\" her husband\\nretorted perversely; and she broke into an appreciative laugh.  \\\"oh,\\nnewland, how funny!  isn't that french?\\\"\\n\\non the whole, he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her\\nrefusing to take seriously his wish to invite m. riviere.  another\\nafter-dinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of\\nnew york; and the more archer considered it the less he was able to fit\\nm. riviere into any conceivable picture of new york as he knew it.\\n\\nhe perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many\\nproblems would be thus negatively solved for him; but as he paid the\\nhansom and followed his wife's long train into the house he took refuge\\nin the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the\\nmost difficult in marriage.  \\\"after that i suppose we shall have pretty\\nnearly finished rubbing off each other's angles,\\\" he reflected; but the\\nworst of it was that may's pressure was already bearing on the very\\nangles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.\\n\\n\\nthe small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea.\\n\\nthe turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus, and\\ncast-iron vases painted in chocolate colour, standing at intervals\\nalong the winding path that led to the sea, looped their garlands of\\npetunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel.\\n\\nhalf way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house\\n(which was also chocolate-coloured, but with the tin roof of the\\nverandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning) two large\\ntargets had been placed against a background of shrubbery.  on the\\nother side of the lawn, facing the targets, was pitched a real tent,\\nwith benches and garden-seats about it.  a number of ladies in summer\\ndresses and gentlemen in grey frock-coats and tall hats stood on the\\nlawn or sat upon the benches; and every now and then a slender girl in\\nstarched muslin would step from the tent, bow in hand, and speed her\\nshaft at one of the targets, while the spectators interrupted their\\ntalk to watch the result.\\n\\nnewland archer, standing on the verandah of the house, looked curiously\\ndown upon this scene.  on each side of the shiny painted steps was a\\nlarge blue china flower-pot on a bright yellow china stand.  a spiky\\ngreen plant filled each pot, and below the verandah ran a wide border\\nof blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums.  behind him, the\\nfrench windows of the drawing-rooms through which he had passed gave\\nglimpses, between swaying lace curtains, of glassy parquet floors\\nislanded with chintz poufs, dwarf armchairs, and velvet tables covered\\nwith trifles in silver.\\n\\nthe newport archery club always held its august meeting at the\\nbeauforts'.  the sport, which had hitherto known no rival but croquet,\\nwas beginning to be discarded in favour of lawn-tennis; but the latter\\ngame was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions,\\nand as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes\\nthe bow and arrow held their own.\\n\\narcher looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle.  it surprised\\nhim that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions\\nto it had so completely changed.  it was newport that had first brought\\nhome to him the extent of the change.  in new york, during the previous\\nwinter, after he and may had settled down in the new greenish-yellow\\nhouse with the bow-window and the pompeian vestibule, he had dropped\\nback with relief into the old routine of the office, and the renewal of\\nthis daily activity had served as a link with his former self.  then\\nthere had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey\\nstepper for may's brougham (the wellands had given the carriage), and\\nthe abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library,\\nwhich, in spite of family doubts and disapprovals, had been carried out\\nas he had dreamed, with a dark embossed paper, eastlake book-cases and\\n\\\"sincere\\\" arm-chairs and tables.  at the century he had found winsett\\nagain, and at the knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own\\nset; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to\\ndining out or entertaining friends at home, with an occasional evening\\nat the opera or the play, the life he was living had still seemed a\\nfairly real and inevitable sort of business.\\n\\nbut newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of\\nunmitigated holiday-making.  archer had tried to persuade may to spend\\nthe summer on a remote island off the coast of maine (called,\\nappropriately enough, mount desert), where a few hardy bostonians and\\nphiladelphians were camping in \\\"native\\\" cottages, and whence came\\nreports of enchanting scenery and a wild, almost trapper-like existence\\namid woods and waters.\\n\\nbut the wellands always went to newport, where they owned one of the\\nsquare boxes on the cliffs, and their son-in-law could adduce no good\\nreason why he and may should not join them there.  as mrs. welland\\nrather tartly pointed out, it was hardly worth while for may to have\\nworn herself out trying on summer clothes in paris if she was not to be\\nallowed to wear them; and this argument was of a kind to which archer\\nhad as yet found no answer.\\n\\nmay herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with\\nso reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer.  she reminded\\nhim that he had always liked newport in his bachelor days, and as this\\nwas indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to\\nlike it better than ever now that they were to be there together.  but\\nas he stood on the beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly\\npeopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to\\nlike it at all.\\n\\nit was not may's fault, poor dear.  if, now and then, during their\\ntravels, they had fallen slightly out of step, harmony had been\\nrestored by their return to the conditions she was used to.  he had\\nalways foreseen that she would not disappoint him; and he had been\\nright.  he had married (as most young men did) because he had met a\\nperfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless\\nsentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust; and she had\\nrepresented peace, stability, comradeship, and the steadying sense of\\nan unescapable duty.\\n\\nhe could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice, for she had\\nfulfilled all that he had expected.  it was undoubtedly gratifying to\\nbe the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married\\nwomen in new york, especially when she was also one of the\\nsweetest-tempered and most reasonable of wives; and archer had never\\nbeen insensible to such advantages.  as for the momentary madness which\\nhad fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage, he had trained himself\\nto regard it as the last of his discarded experiments.  the idea that\\nhe could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying the countess\\nolenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory\\nsimply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.\\n\\nbut all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather\\nempty and echoing place, and he supposed that was one of the reasons\\nwhy the busy animated people on the beaufort lawn shocked him as if\\nthey had been children playing in a grave-yard.\\n\\nhe heard a murmur of skirts beside him, and the marchioness manson\\nfluttered out of the drawing-room window.  as usual, she was\\nextraordinarily festooned and bedizened, with a limp leghorn hat\\nanchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze, and a little\\nblack velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over\\nher much larger hatbrim.\\n\\n\\\"my dear newland, i had no idea that you and may had arrived!  you\\nyourself came only yesterday, you say?  ah,\\nbusiness--business--professional duties ... i understand.  many\\nhusbands, i know, find it impossible to join their wives here except\\nfor the week-end.\\\"  she cocked her head on one side and languished at\\nhim through screwed-up eyes.  \\\"but marriage is one long sacrifice, as i\\nused often to remind my ellen--\\\"\\n\\narcher's heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once\\nbefore, and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and\\nthe outer world; but this break of continuity must have been of the\\nbriefest, for he presently heard medora answering a question he had\\napparently found voice to put.\\n\\n\\\"no, i am not staying here, but with the blenkers, in their delicious\\nsolitude at portsmouth.  beaufort was kind enough to send his famous\\ntrotters for me this morning, so that i might have at least a glimpse\\nof one of regina's garden-parties; but this evening i go back to rural\\nlife.  the blenkers, dear original beings, have hired a primitive old\\nfarm-house at portsmouth where they gather about them representative\\npeople ...\\\"  she drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim, and\\nadded with a faint blush:  \\\"this week dr. agathon carver is holding a\\nseries of inner thought meetings there.  a contrast indeed to this gay\\nscene of worldly pleasure--but then i have always lived on contrasts!\\nto me the only death is monotony.  i always say to ellen: beware of\\nmonotony; it's the mother of all the deadly sins.  but my poor child is\\ngoing through a phase of exaltation, of abhorrence of the world.  you\\nknow, i suppose, that she has declined all invitations to stay at\\nnewport, even with her grandmother mingott?  i could hardly persuade\\nher to come with me to the blenkers', if you will believe it!  the life\\nshe leads is morbid, unnatural.  ah, if she had only listened to me\\nwhen it was still possible ... when the door was still open ... but\\nshall we go down and watch this absorbing match?  i hear your may is\\none of the competitors.\\\"\\n\\nstrolling toward them from the tent beaufort advanced over the lawn,\\ntall, heavy, too tightly buttoned into a london frock-coat, with one of\\nhis own orchids in its buttonhole.  archer, who had not seen him for\\ntwo or three months, was struck by the change in his appearance.  in\\nthe hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but\\nfor his erect square-shouldered walk he would have looked like an\\nover-fed and over-dressed old man.\\n\\nthere were all sorts of rumours afloat about beaufort.  in the spring\\nhe had gone off on a long cruise to the west indies in his new\\nsteam-yacht, and it was reported that, at various points where he had\\ntouched, a lady resembling miss fanny ring had been seen in his\\ncompany.  the steam-yacht, built in the clyde, and fitted with tiled\\nbath-rooms and other unheard-of luxuries, was said to have cost him\\nhalf a million; and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his\\nwife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are\\napt to be.  beaufort's fortune was substantial enough to stand the\\nstrain; and yet the disquieting rumours persisted, not only in fifth\\navenue but in wall street.  some people said he had speculated\\nunfortunately in railways, others that he was being bled by one of the\\nmost insatiable members of her profession; and to every report of\\nthreatened insolvency beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance: the\\nbuilding of a new row of orchid-houses, the purchase of a new string of\\nrace-horses, or the addition of a new meissonnier or cabanel to his\\npicture-gallery.\\n\\nhe advanced toward the marchioness and newland with his usual\\nhalf-sneering smile.  \\\"hullo, medora!  did the trotters do their\\nbusiness?  forty minutes, eh?  ...  well, that's not so bad,\\nconsidering your nerves had to be spared.\\\"  he shook hands with archer,\\nand then, turning back with them, placed himself on mrs. manson's other\\nside, and said, in a low voice, a few words which their companion did\\nnot catch.\\n\\nthe marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks, and a \\\"que\\nvoulez-vous?\\\" which deepened beaufort's frown; but he produced a good\\nsemblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at archer to say:\\n\\\"you know may's going to carry off the first prize.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, then it remains in the family,\\\" medora rippled; and at that moment\\nthey reached the tent and mrs. beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of\\nmauve muslin and floating veils.\\n\\nmay welland was just coming out of the tent.  in her white dress, with\\na pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat, she\\nhad the same diana-like aloofness as when she had entered the beaufort\\nball-room on the night of her engagement.  in the interval not a\\nthought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her\\nheart; and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both\\nhe marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from\\nher.\\n\\nshe had her bow and arrow in her hand, and placing herself on the\\nchalk-mark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and\\ntook aim.  the attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of\\nappreciation followed her appearance, and archer felt the glow of\\nproprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary well-being.\\nher rivals--mrs. reggie chivers, the merry girls, and divers rosy\\nthorleys, dagonets and mingotts, stood behind her in a lovely anxious\\ngroup, brown heads and golden bent above the scores, and pale muslins\\nand flower-wreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow.  all were young\\nand pretty, and bathed in summer bloom; but not one had the nymph-like\\nease of his wife, when, with tense muscles and happy frown, she bent\\nher soul upon some feat of strength.\\n\\n\\\"gad,\\\" archer heard lawrence lefferts say, \\\"not one of the lot holds\\nthe bow as she does\\\"; and beaufort retorted:  \\\"yes; but that's the only\\nkind of target she'll ever hit.\\\"\\n\\narcher felt irrationally angry.  his host's contemptuous tribute to\\nmay's \\\"niceness\\\" was just what a husband should have wished to hear\\nsaid of his wife.  the fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking\\nin attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words\\nsent a faint shiver through his heart.  what if \\\"niceness\\\" carried to\\nthat supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an\\nemptiness?  as he looked at may, returning flushed and calm from her\\nfinal bull's-eye, he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that\\ncurtain.\\n\\nshe took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the\\ncompany with the simplicity that was her crowning grace.  no one could\\never be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling\\nthat she would have been just as serene if she had missed them.  but\\nwhen her eyes met her husband's her face glowed with the pleasure she\\nsaw in his.\\n\\nmrs. welland's basket-work pony-carriage was waiting for them, and they\\ndrove off among the dispersing carriages, may handling the reins and\\narcher sitting at her side.\\n\\nthe afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and\\nshrubberies, and up and down bellevue avenue rolled a double line of\\nvictorias, dog-carts, landaus and \\\"vis-a-vis,\\\" carrying well-dressed\\nladies and gentlemen away from the beaufort garden-party, or homeward\\nfrom their daily afternoon turn along the ocean drive.\\n\\n\\\"shall we go to see granny?\\\" may suddenly proposed.  \\\"i should like to\\ntell her myself that i've won the prize.  there's lots of time before\\ndinner.\\\"\\n\\narcher acquiesced, and she turned the ponies down narragansett avenue,\\ncrossed spring street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond.\\nin this unfashionable region catherine the great, always indifferent to\\nprecedent and thrifty of purse, had built herself in her youth a\\nmany-peaked and cross-beamed cottage-orne on a bit of cheap land\\noverlooking the bay.  here, in a thicket of stunted oaks, her verandahs\\nspread themselves above the island-dotted waters.  a winding drive led\\nup between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of\\ngeraniums to a front door of highly-varnished walnut under a striped\\nverandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow\\nstar-patterned parquet floor, upon which opened four small square rooms\\nwith heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an italian\\nhouse-painter had lavished all the divinities of olympus.  one of these\\nrooms had been turned into a bedroom by mrs. mingott when the burden of\\nflesh descended on her, and in the adjoining one she spent her days,\\nenthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window, and\\nperpetually waving a palm-leaf fan which the prodigious projection of\\nher bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set\\nin motion stirred only the fringe of the anti-macassars on the\\nchair-arms.\\n\\nsince she had been the means of hastening his marriage old catherine\\nhad shown to archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites\\ntoward the person served.  she was persuaded that irrepressible passion\\nwas the cause of his impatience; and being an ardent admirer of\\nimpulsiveness (when it did not lead to the spending of money) she\\nalways received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of\\nallusion to which may seemed fortunately impervious.\\n\\nshe examined and appraised with much interest the diamond-tipped arrow\\nwhich had been pinned on may's bosom at the conclusion of the match,\\nremarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought\\nenough, but that there was no denying that beaufort did things\\nhandsomely.\\n\\n\\\"quite an heirloom, in fact, my dear,\\\" the old lady chuckled.  \\\"you\\nmust leave it in fee to your eldest girl.\\\" she pinched may's white arm\\nand watched the colour flood her face.  \\\"well, well, what have i said\\nto make you shake out the red flag?  ain't there going to be any\\ndaughters--only boys, eh?  good gracious, look at her blushing again\\nall over her blushes!  what--can't i say that either?  mercy me--when\\nmy children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out\\noverhead i always say i'm too thankful to have somebody about me that\\nnothing can shock!\\\"\\n\\narcher burst into a laugh, and may echoed it, crimson to the eyes.\\n\\n\\\"well, now tell me all about the party, please, my dears, for i shall\\nnever get a straight word about it out of that silly medora,\\\" the\\nancestress continued; and, as may exclaimed:  \\\"cousin medora?  but i\\nthought she was going back to portsmouth?\\\" she answered placidly: \\\"so\\nshe is--but she's got to come here first to pick up ellen.  ah--you\\ndidn't know ellen had come to spend the day with me?  such fol-de-rol,\\nher not coming for the summer; but i gave up arguing with young people\\nabout fifty years ago.  ellen--ellen!\\\" she cried in her shrill old\\nvoice, trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn\\nbeyond the verandah.\\n\\nthere was no answer, and mrs. mingott rapped impatiently with her stick\\non the shiny floor.  a mulatto maid-servant in a bright turban,\\nreplying to the summons, informed her mistress that she had seen \\\"miss\\nellen\\\" going down the path to the shore; and mrs. mingott turned to\\narcher.\\n\\n\\\"run down and fetch her, like a good grandson; this pretty lady will\\ndescribe the party to me,\\\" she said; and archer stood up as if in a\\ndream.\\n\\nhe had heard the countess olenska's name pronounced often enough during\\nthe year and a half since they had last met, and was even familiar with\\nthe main incidents of her life in the interval.  he knew that she had\\nspent the previous summer at newport, where she appeared to have gone a\\ngreat deal into society, but that in the autumn she had suddenly\\nsub-let the \\\"perfect house\\\" which beaufort had been at such pains to\\nfind for her, and decided to establish herself in washington.  there,\\nduring the winter, he had heard of her (as one always heard of pretty\\nwomen in washington) as shining in the \\\"brilliant diplomatic society\\\"\\nthat was supposed to make up for the social short-comings of the\\nadministration.  he had listened to these accounts, and to various\\ncontradictory reports on her appearance, her conversation, her point of\\nview and her choice of friends, with the detachment with which one\\nlistens to reminiscences of some one long since dead; not till medora\\nsuddenly spoke her name at the archery match had ellen olenska become a\\nliving presence to him again.  the marchioness's foolish lisp had\\ncalled up a vision of the little fire-lit drawing-room and the sound of\\nthe carriage-wheels returning down the deserted street.  he thought of\\na story he had read, of some peasant children in tuscany lighting a\\nbunch of straw in a wayside cavern, and revealing old silent images in\\ntheir painted tomb ...\\n\\nthe way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was\\nperched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows.\\nthrough their veil archer caught the glint of the lime rock, with its\\nwhite-washed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic light-house\\nkeeper, ida lewis, was living her last venerable years.  beyond it lay\\nthe flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of goat island, the bay\\nspreading northward in a shimmer of gold to prudence island with its\\nlow growth of oaks, and the shores of conanicut faint in the sunset\\nhaze.\\n\\nfrom the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of\\npagoda-like summer-house; and in the pagoda a lady stood, leaning\\nagainst the rail, her back to the shore.  archer stopped at the sight\\nas if he had waked from sleep.  that vision of the past was a dream,\\nand the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead:\\nwas mrs. welland's pony-carriage circling around and around the oval at\\nthe door, was may sitting under the shameless olympians and glowing\\nwith secret hopes, was the welland villa at the far end of bellevue\\navenue, and mr. welland, already dressed for dinner, and pacing the\\ndrawing-room floor, watch in hand, with dyspeptic impatience--for it\\nwas one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is\\nhappening at a given hour.\\n\\n\\\"what am i?  a son-in-law--\\\" archer thought.\\n\\nthe figure at the end of the pier had not moved.  for a long moment the\\nyoung man stood half way down the bank, gazing at the bay furrowed with\\nthe coming and going of sailboats, yacht-launches, fishing-craft and\\nthe trailing black coal-barges hauled by noisy tugs.  the lady in the\\nsummer-house seemed to be held by the same sight.  beyond the grey\\nbastions of fort adams a long-drawn sunset was splintering up into a\\nthousand fires, and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it\\nbeat out through the channel between the lime rock and the shore.\\narcher, as he watched, remembered the scene in the shaughraun, and\\nmontague lifting ada dyas's ribbon to his lips without her knowing that\\nhe was in the room.\\n\\n\\\"she doesn't know--she hasn't guessed.  shouldn't i know if she came up\\nbehind me, i wonder?\\\" he mused; and suddenly he said to himself:  \\\"if\\nshe doesn't turn before that sail crosses the lime rock light i'll go\\nback.\\\"\\n\\nthe boat was gliding out on the receding tide.  it slid before the lime\\nrock, blotted out ida lewis's little house, and passed across the\\nturret in which the light was hung.  archer waited till a wide space of\\nwater sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the\\nboat; but still the figure in the summer-house did not move.\\n\\nhe turned and walked up the hill.\\n\\n\\n\\\"i'm sorry you didn't find ellen--i should have liked to see her\\nagain,\\\" may said as they drove home through the dusk.  \\\"but perhaps she\\nwouldn't have cared--she seems so changed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"changed?\\\" echoed her husband in a colourless voice, his eyes fixed on\\nthe ponies' twitching ears.\\n\\n\\\"so indifferent to her friends, i mean; giving up new york and her\\nhouse, and spending her time with such queer people.  fancy how\\nhideously uncomfortable she must be at the blenkers'!  she says she\\ndoes it to keep cousin medora out of mischief: to prevent her marrying\\ndreadful people.  but i sometimes think we've always bored her.\\\"\\n\\narcher made no answer, and she continued, with a tinge of hardness that\\nhe had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice:  \\\"after all, i\\nwonder if she wouldn't be happier with her husband.\\\"\\n\\nhe burst into a laugh.  \\\"sancta simplicitas!\\\" he exclaimed; and as she\\nturned a puzzled frown on him he added:  \\\"i don't think i ever heard\\nyou say a cruel thing before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"cruel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a\\nfavourite sport of the angels; but i believe even they don't think\\npeople happier in hell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's a pity she ever married abroad then,\\\" said may, in the placid\\ntone with which her mother met mr. welland's vagaries; and archer felt\\nhimself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands.\\n\\nthey drove down bellevue avenue and turned in between the chamfered\\nwooden gate-posts surmounted by cast-iron lamps which marked the\\napproach to the welland villa.  lights were already shining through its\\nwindows, and archer, as the carriage stopped, caught a glimpse of his\\nfather-in-law, exactly as he had pictured him, pacing the drawing-room,\\nwatch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since\\nfound to be much more efficacious than anger.\\n\\nthe young man, as he followed his wife into the hall, was conscious of\\na curious reversal of mood.  there was something about the luxury of\\nthe welland house and the density of the welland atmosphere, so charged\\nwith minute observances and exactions, that always stole into his\\nsystem like a narcotic.  the heavy carpets, the watchful servants, the\\nperpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks, the perpetually\\nrenewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table, the whole\\nchain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next, and each\\nmember of the household to all the others, made any less systematised\\nand affluent existence seem unreal and precarious.  but now it was the\\nwelland house, and the life he was expected to lead in it, that had\\nbecome unreal and irrelevant, and the brief scene on the shore, when he\\nhad stood irresolute, halfway down the bank, was as close to him as the\\nblood in his veins.\\n\\nall night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at may's side,\\nwatching the moonlight slant along the carpet, and thinking of ellen\\nolenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind beaufort's\\ntrotters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"a party for the blenkers--the blenkers?\\\"\\n\\nmr. welland laid down his knife and fork and looked anxiously and\\nincredulously across the luncheon-table at his wife, who, adjusting her\\ngold eye-glasses, read aloud, in the tone of high comedy:\\n\\n\\\"professor and mrs. emerson sillerton request the pleasure of mr. and\\nmrs. welland's company at the meeting of the wednesday afternoon club\\non august 25th at 3 o'clock punctually.  to meet mrs. and the misses\\nblenker.\\n\\n\\\"red gables, catherine street.  r. s. v. p.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"good gracious--\\\" mr. welland gasped, as if a second reading had been\\nnecessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him.\\n\\n\\\"poor amy sillerton--you never can tell what her husband will do next,\\\"\\nmrs. welland sighed.  \\\"i suppose he's just discovered the blenkers.\\\"\\n\\nprofessor emerson sillerton was a thorn in the side of newport society;\\nand a thorn that could not be plucked out, for it grew on a venerable\\nand venerated family tree.  he was, as people said, a man who had had\\n\\\"every advantage.\\\"  his father was sillerton jackson's uncle, his\\nmother a pennilow of boston; on each side there was wealth and\\nposition, and mutual suitability.  nothing--as mrs. welland had often\\nremarked--nothing on earth obliged emerson sillerton to be an\\narchaeologist, or indeed a professor of any sort, or to live in newport\\nin winter, or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did.\\nbut at least, if he was going to break with tradition and flout society\\nin the face, he need not have married poor amy dagonet, who had a right\\nto expect \\\"something different,\\\" and money enough to keep her own\\ncarriage.\\n\\nno one in the mingott set could understand why amy sillerton had\\nsubmitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the\\nhouse with long-haired men and short-haired women, and, when he\\ntravelled, took her to explore tombs in yucatan instead of going to\\nparis or italy.  but there they were, set in their ways, and apparently\\nunaware that they were different from other people; and when they gave\\none of their dreary annual garden-parties every family on the cliffs,\\nbecause of the sillerton-pennilow-dagonet connection, had to draw lots\\nand send an unwilling representative.\\n\\n\\\"it's a wonder,\\\" mrs. welland remarked, \\\"that they didn't choose the\\ncup race day!  do you remember, two years ago, their giving a party for\\na black man on the day of julia mingott's the dansant?  luckily this\\ntime there's nothing else going on that i know of--for of course some\\nof us will have to go.\\\"\\n\\nmr. welland sighed nervously.  \\\"'some of us,' my dear--more than one?\\nthree o'clock is such a very awkward hour.  i have to be here at\\nhalf-past three to take my drops: it's really no use trying to follow\\nbencomb's new treatment if i don't do it systematically; and if i join\\nyou later, of course i shall miss my drive.\\\"  at the thought he laid\\ndown his knife and fork again, and a flush of anxiety rose to his\\nfinely-wrinkled cheek.\\n\\n\\\"there's no reason why you should go at all, my dear,\\\" his wife\\nanswered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic.  \\\"i have some\\ncards to leave at the other end of bellevue avenue, and i'll drop in at\\nabout half-past three and stay long enough to make poor amy feel that\\nshe hasn't been slighted.\\\"  she glanced hesitatingly at her daughter.\\n\\\"and if newland's afternoon is provided for perhaps may can drive you\\nout with the ponies, and try their new russet harness.\\\"\\n\\nit was a principle in the welland family that people's days and hours\\nshould be what mrs. welland called \\\"provided for.\\\"  the melancholy\\npossibility of having to \\\"kill time\\\" (especially for those who did not\\ncare for whist or solitaire) was a vision that haunted her as the\\nspectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist.  another of her\\nprinciples was that parents should never (at least visibly) interfere\\nwith the plans of their married children; and the difficulty of\\nadjusting this respect for may's independence with the exigency of mr.\\nwelland's claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity\\nwhich left not a second of mrs. welland's own time unprovided for.\\n\\n\\\"of course i'll drive with papa--i'm sure newland will find something\\nto do,\\\" may said, in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his\\nlack of response.  it was a cause of constant distress to mrs. welland\\nthat her son-in-law showed so little foresight in planning his days.\\noften already, during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof,\\nwhen she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon, he had answered\\nparadoxically:  \\\"oh, i think for a change i'll just save it instead of\\nspending it--\\\" and once, when she and may had had to go on a\\nlong-postponed round of afternoon calls, he had confessed to having\\nlain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house.\\n\\n\\\"newland never seems to look ahead,\\\" mrs. welland once ventured to\\ncomplain to her daughter; and may answered serenely:  \\\"no; but you see\\nit doesn't matter, because when there's nothing particular to do he\\nreads a book.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, yes--like his father!\\\" mrs. welland agreed, as if allowing for an\\ninherited oddity; and after that the question of newland's unemployment\\nwas tacitly dropped.\\n\\nnevertheless, as the day for the sillerton reception approached, may\\nbegan to show a natural solicitude for his welfare, and to suggest a\\ntennis match at the chiverses', or a sail on julius beaufort's cutter,\\nas a means of atoning for her temporary desertion.  \\\"i shall be back by\\nsix, you know, dear: papa never drives later than that--\\\" and she was\\nnot reassured till archer said that he thought of hiring a run-about\\nand driving up the island to a stud-farm to look at a second horse for\\nher brougham.  they had been looking for this horse for some time, and\\nthe suggestion was so acceptable that may glanced at her mother as if\\nto say:  \\\"you see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of\\nus.\\\"\\n\\nthe idea of the stud-farm and the brougham horse had germinated in\\narcher's mind on the very day when the emerson sillerton invitation had\\nfirst been mentioned; but he had kept it to himself as if there were\\nsomething clandestine in the plan, and discovery might prevent its\\nexecution.  he had, however, taken the precaution to engage in advance\\na runabout with a pair of old livery-stable trotters that could still\\ndo their eighteen miles on level roads; and at two o'clock, hastily\\ndeserting the luncheon-table, he sprang into the light carriage and\\ndrove off.\\n\\nthe day was perfect.  a breeze from the north drove little puffs of\\nwhite cloud across an ultramarine sky, with a bright sea running under\\nit.  bellevue avenue was empty at that hour, and after dropping the\\nstable-lad at the corner of mill street archer turned down the old\\nbeach road and drove across eastman's beach.\\n\\nhe had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which, on\\nhalf-holidays at school, he used to start off into the unknown.  taking\\nhis pair at an easy gait, he counted on reaching the stud-farm, which\\nwas not far beyond paradise rocks, before three o'clock; so that, after\\nlooking over the horse (and trying him if he seemed promising) he would\\nstill have four golden hours to dispose of.\\n\\nas soon as he heard of the sillerton's party he had said to himself\\nthat the marchioness manson would certainly come to newport with the\\nblenkers, and that madame olenska might again take the opportunity of\\nspending the day with her grandmother.  at any rate, the blenker\\nhabitation would probably be deserted, and he would be able, without\\nindiscretion, to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it.  he was not\\nsure that he wanted to see the countess olenska again; but ever since\\nhe had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted,\\nirrationally and indescribably, to see the place she was living in, and\\nto follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the\\nreal one in the summer-house.  the longing was with him day and night,\\nan incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man\\nfor food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten.  he could not\\nsee beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was\\nnot conscious of any wish to speak to madame olenska or to hear her\\nvoice.  he simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the\\nspot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it,\\nthe rest of the world might seem less empty.\\n\\nwhen he reached the stud-farm a glance showed him that the horse was\\nnot what he wanted; nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to\\nprove to himself that he was not in a hurry.  but at three o'clock he\\nshook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by-roads\\nleading to portsmouth.  the wind had dropped and a faint haze on the\\nhorizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the saconnet on the\\nturn of the tide; but all about him fields and woods were steeped in\\ngolden light.\\n\\nhe drove past grey-shingled farm-houses in orchards, past hay-fields\\nand groves of oak, past villages with white steeples rising sharply\\ninto the fading sky; and at last, after stopping to ask the way of some\\nmen at work in a field, he turned down a lane between high banks of\\ngoldenrod and brambles.  at the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of\\nthe river; to the left, standing in front of a clump of oaks and\\nmaples, he saw a long tumble-down house with white paint peeling from\\nits clapboards.\\n\\non the road-side facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in\\nwhich the new englander shelters his farming implements and visitors\\n\\\"hitch\\\" their \\\"teams.\\\" archer, jumping down, led his pair into the\\nshed, and after tying them to a post turned toward the house.  the\\npatch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hay-field; but to the left\\nan overgrown box-garden full of dahlias and rusty rose-bushes encircled\\na ghostly summer-house of trellis-work that had once been white,\\nsurmounted by a wooden cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but\\ncontinued to take ineffectual aim.\\n\\narcher leaned for a while against the gate.  no one was in sight, and\\nnot a sound came from the open windows of the house: a grizzled\\nnewfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as\\nthe arrowless cupid.  it was strange to think that this place of\\nsilence and decay was the home of the turbulent blenkers; yet archer\\nwas sure that he was not mistaken.\\n\\nfor a long time he stood there, content to take in the scene, and\\ngradually falling under its drowsy spell; but at length he roused\\nhimself to the sense of the passing time.  should he look his fill and\\nthen drive away?  he stood irresolute, wishing suddenly to see the\\ninside of the house, so that he might picture the room that madame\\nolenska sat in.  there was nothing to prevent his walking up to the\\ndoor and ringing the bell; if, as he supposed, she was away with the\\nrest of the party, he could easily give his name, and ask permission to\\ngo into the sitting-room to write a message.\\n\\nbut instead, he crossed the lawn and turned toward the box-garden.  as\\nhe entered it he caught sight of something bright-coloured in the\\nsummer-house, and presently made it out to be a pink parasol.  the\\nparasol drew him like a magnet: he was sure it was hers.  he went into\\nthe summer-house, and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the\\nsilken thing and looked at its carved handle, which was made of some\\nrare wood that gave out an aromatic scent.  archer lifted the handle to\\nhis lips.\\n\\nhe heard a rustle of skirts against the box, and sat motionless,\\nleaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands, and letting the\\nrustle come nearer without lifting his eyes.  he had always known that\\nthis must happen ...\\n\\n\\\"oh, mr. archer!\\\" exclaimed a loud young voice; and looking up he saw\\nbefore him the youngest and largest of the blenker girls, blonde and\\nblowsy, in bedraggled muslin.  a red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed\\nto show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow, and her\\nhalf-awakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly.\\n\\n\\\"gracious--where did you drop from?  i must have been sound asleep in\\nthe hammock.  everybody else has gone to newport.  did you ring?\\\" she\\nincoherently enquired.\\n\\narcher's confusion was greater than hers.  \\\"i--no--that is, i was just\\ngoing to.  i had to come up the island to see about a horse, and i\\ndrove over on a chance of finding mrs. blenker and your visitors.  but\\nthe house seemed empty--so i sat down to wait.\\\"\\n\\nmiss blenker, shaking off the fumes of sleep, looked at him with\\nincreasing interest.  \\\"the house is empty.  mother's not here, or the\\nmarchioness--or anybody but me.\\\"  her glance became faintly\\nreproachful.  \\\"didn't you know that professor and mrs. sillerton are\\ngiving a garden-party for mother and all of us this afternoon?  it was\\ntoo unlucky that i couldn't go; but i've had a sore throat, and mother\\nwas afraid of the drive home this evening.  did you ever know anything\\nso disappointing?  of course,\\\" she added gaily, \\\"i shouldn't have\\nminded half as much if i'd known you were coming.\\\"\\n\\nsymptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her, and archer\\nfound the strength to break in:  \\\"but madame olenska--has she gone to\\nnewport too?\\\"\\n\\nmiss blenker looked at him with surprise.  \\\"madame olenska--didn't you\\nknow she'd been called away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"called away?--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, my best parasol!  i lent it to that goose of a katie, because it\\nmatched her ribbons, and the careless thing must have dropped it here.\\nwe blenkers are all like that ... real bohemians!\\\"  recovering the\\nsunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy\\ndome above her head.  \\\"yes, ellen was called away yesterday: she lets\\nus call her ellen, you know.  a telegram came from boston: she said she\\nmight be gone for two days.  i do love the way she does her hair, don't\\nyou?\\\" miss blenker rambled on.\\n\\narcher continued to stare through her as though she had been\\ntransparent.  all he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its\\npinkness above her giggling head.\\n\\nafter a moment he ventured:  \\\"you don't happen to know why madame\\nolenska went to boston?  i hope it was not on account of bad news?\\\"\\n\\nmiss blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity.  \\\"oh, i don't\\nbelieve so.  she didn't tell us what was in the telegram.  i think she\\ndidn't want the marchioness to know.  she's so romantic-looking, isn't\\nshe?  doesn't she remind you of mrs. scott-siddons when she reads 'lady\\ngeraldine's courtship'?  did you never hear her?\\\"\\n\\narcher was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts.  his whole future\\nseemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless\\nemptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever\\nto happen.  he glanced about him at the unpruned garden, the\\ntumble-down house, and the oak-grove under which the dusk was\\ngathering.  it had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to\\nhave found madame olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink\\nsunshade was not hers ...\\n\\nhe frowned and hesitated.  \\\"you don't know, i suppose--i shall be in\\nboston tomorrow.  if i could manage to see her--\\\"\\n\\nhe felt that miss blenker was losing interest in him, though her smile\\npersisted.  \\\"oh, of course; how lovely of you!  she's staying at the\\nparker house; it must be horrible there in this weather.\\\"\\n\\nafter that archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they\\nexchanged.  he could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that\\nhe should await the returning family and have high tea with them before\\nhe drove home.  at length, with his hostess still at his side, he\\npassed out of range of the wooden cupid, unfastened his horses and\\ndrove off.  at the turn of the lane he saw miss blenker standing at the\\ngate and waving the pink parasol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe next morning, when archer got out of the fall river train, he\\nemerged upon a steaming midsummer boston.  the streets near the station\\nwere full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a\\nshirt-sleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of\\nboarders going down the passage to the bathroom.\\n\\narcher found a cab and drove to the somerset club for breakfast.  even\\nthe fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no\\nexcess of heat ever degrades the european cities.  care-takers in\\ncalico lounged on the door-steps of the wealthy, and the common looked\\nlike a pleasure-ground on the morrow of a masonic picnic.  if archer\\nhad tried to imagine ellen olenska in improbable scenes he could not\\nhave called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than\\nthis heat-prostrated and deserted boston.\\n\\nhe breakfasted with appetite and method, beginning with a slice of\\nmelon, and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and\\nscrambled eggs.  a new sense of energy and activity had possessed him\\never since he had announced to may the night before that he had\\nbusiness in boston, and should take the fall river boat that night and\\ngo on to new york the following evening.  it had always been understood\\nthat he would return to town early in the week, and when he got back\\nfrom his expedition to portsmouth a letter from the office, which fate\\nhad conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table, sufficed to\\njustify his sudden change of plan.  he was even ashamed of the ease\\nwith which the whole thing had been done: it reminded him, for an\\nuncomfortable moment, of lawrence lefferts's masterly contrivances for\\nsecuring his freedom.  but this did not long trouble him, for he was\\nnot in an analytic mood.\\n\\nafter breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the commercial\\nadvertiser.  while he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came\\nin, and the usual greetings were exchanged: it was the same world after\\nall, though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the\\nmeshes of time and space.\\n\\nhe looked at his watch, and finding that it was half-past nine got up\\nand went into the writing-room.  there he wrote a few lines, and\\nordered a messenger to take a cab to the parker house and wait for the\\nanswer.  he then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to\\ncalculate how long it would take a cab to get to the parker house.\\n\\n\\\"the lady was out, sir,\\\" he suddenly heard a waiter's voice at his\\nelbow; and he stammered:  \\\"out?--\\\" as if it were a word in a strange\\nlanguage.\\n\\nhe got up and went into the hall.  it must be a mistake: she could not\\nbe out at that hour.  he flushed with anger at his own stupidity: why\\nhad he not sent the note as soon as he arrived?\\n\\nhe found his hat and stick and went forth into the street.  the city\\nhad suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a\\ntraveller from distant lands.  for a moment he stood on the door-step\\nhesitating; then he decided to go to the parker house.  what if the\\nmessenger had been misinformed, and she were still there?\\n\\nhe started to walk across the common; and on the first bench, under a\\ntree, he saw her sitting.  she had a grey silk sunshade over her\\nhead--how could he ever have imagined her with a pink one?  as he\\napproached he was struck by her listless attitude: she sat there as if\\nshe had nothing else to do.  he saw her drooping profile, and the knot\\nof hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat, and the long\\nwrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade.  he came a step or\\ntwo nearer, and she turned and looked at him.\\n\\n\\\"oh\\\"--she said; and for the first time he noticed a startled look on\\nher face; but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder\\nand contentment.\\n\\n\\\"oh\\\"--she murmured again, on a different note, as he stood looking down\\nat her; and without rising she made a place for him on the bench.\\n\\n\\\"i'm here on business--just got here,\\\" archer explained; and, without\\nknowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her.\\n\\\"but what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?\\\"  he had really no\\nidea what he was saying: he felt as if he were shouting at her across\\nendless distances, and she might vanish again before he could overtake\\nher.\\n\\n\\\"i?  oh, i'm here on business too,\\\" she answered, turning her head\\ntoward him so that they were face to face.  the words hardly reached\\nhim: he was aware only of her voice, and of the startling fact that not\\nan echo of it had remained in his memory.  he had not even remembered\\nthat it was low-pitched, with a faint roughness on the consonants.\\n\\n\\\"you do your hair differently,\\\" he said, his heart beating as if he had\\nuttered something irrevocable.\\n\\n\\\"differently?  no--it's only that i do it as best i can when i'm\\nwithout nastasia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"nastasia; but isn't she with you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no; i'm alone.  for two days it was not worth while to bring her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you're alone--at the parker house?\\\"\\n\\nshe looked at him with a flash of her old malice.  \\\"does it strike you\\nas dangerous?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no; not dangerous--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but unconventional?  i see; i suppose it is.\\\"  she considered a\\nmoment.  \\\"i hadn't thought of it, because i've just done something so\\nmuch more unconventional.\\\" the faint tinge of irony lingered in her\\neyes.  \\\"i've just refused to take back a sum of money--that belonged to\\nme.\\\"\\n\\narcher sprang up and moved a step or two away.  she had furled her\\nparasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel.  presently he\\ncame back and stood before her.\\n\\n\\\"some one--has come here to meet you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"with this offer?\\\"\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n\\\"and you refused--because of the conditions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i refused,\\\" she said after a moment.\\n\\nhe sat down by her again.  \\\"what were the conditions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, they were not onerous: just to sit at the head of his table now\\nand then.\\\"\\n\\nthere was another interval of silence.  archer's heart had slammed\\nitself shut in the queer way it had, and he sat vainly groping for a\\nword.\\n\\n\\\"he wants you back--at any price?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--a considerable price.  at least the sum is considerable for me.\\\"\\n\\nhe paused again, beating about the question he felt he must put.\\n\\n\\\"it was to meet him here that you came?\\\"\\n\\nshe stared, and then burst into a laugh.  \\\"meet him--my husband?  here?\\nat this season he's always at cowes or baden.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"he sent some one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"with a letter?\\\"\\n\\nshe shook her head.  \\\"no; just a message.  he never writes.  i don't\\nthink i've had more than one letter from him.\\\"  the allusion brought\\nthe colour to her cheek, and it reflected itself in archer's vivid\\nblush.\\n\\n\\\"why does he never write?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"why should he?  what does one have secretaries for?\\\"\\n\\nthe young man's blush deepened.  she had pronounced the word as if it\\nhad no more significance than any other in her vocabulary.  for a\\nmoment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask:  \\\"did he send his\\nsecretary, then?\\\"  but the remembrance of count olenski's only letter\\nto his wife was too present to him.  he paused again, and then took\\nanother plunge.\\n\\n\\\"and the person?\\\"--\\n\\n\\\"the emissary?  the emissary,\\\" madame olenska rejoined, still smiling,\\n\\\"might, for all i care, have left already; but he has insisted on\\nwaiting till this evening ... in case ... on the chance ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and you came out here to think the chance over?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i came out to get a breath of air.  the hotel's too stifling.  i'm\\ntaking the afternoon train back to portsmouth.\\\"\\n\\nthey sat silent, not looking at each other, but straight ahead at the\\npeople passing along the path.  finally she turned her eyes again to\\nhis face and said:  \\\"you're not changed.\\\"\\n\\nhe felt like answering:  \\\"i was, till i saw you again;\\\" but instead he\\nstood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park.\\n\\n\\\"this is horrible.  why shouldn't we go out a little on the bay?\\nthere's a breeze, and it will be cooler.  we might take the steamboat\\ndown to point arley.\\\"  she glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went\\non:  \\\"on a monday morning there won't be anybody on the boat.  my train\\ndoesn't leave till evening: i'm going back to new york.  why shouldn't\\nwe?\\\" he insisted, looking down at her; and suddenly he broke out:\\n\\\"haven't we done all we could?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh\\\"--she murmured again.  she stood up and reopened her sunshade,\\nglancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure\\nherself of the impossibility of remaining in it.  then her eyes\\nreturned to his face.  \\\"you mustn't say things like that to me,\\\" she\\nsaid.\\n\\n\\\"i'll say anything you like; or nothing.  i won't open my mouth unless\\nyou tell me to.  what harm can it do to anybody?  all i want is to\\nlisten to you,\\\" he stammered.\\n\\nshe drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enamelled chain.  \\\"oh,\\ndon't calculate,\\\" he broke out; \\\"give me the day!  i want to get you\\naway from that man.  at what time was he coming?\\\"\\n\\nher colour rose again.  \\\"at eleven.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"then you must come at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you needn't be afraid--if i don't come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"nor you either--if you do.  i swear i only want to hear about you, to\\nknow what you've been doing.  it's a hundred years since we've met--it\\nmay be another hundred before we meet again.\\\"\\n\\nshe still wavered, her anxious eyes on his face.  \\\"why didn't you come\\ndown to the beach to fetch me, the day i was at granny's?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"because you didn't look round--because you didn't know i was there.  i\\nswore i wouldn't unless you looked round.\\\"  he laughed as the\\nchildishness of the confession struck him.\\n\\n\\\"but i didn't look round on purpose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"on purpose?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i knew you were there; when you drove in i recognised the ponies.  so\\ni went down to the beach.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"to get away from me as far as you could?\\\"\\n\\nshe repeated in a low voice:  \\\"to get away from you as far as i could.\\\"\\n\\nhe laughed out again, this time in boyish satisfaction.  \\\"well, you see\\nit's no use.  i may as well tell you,\\\" he added, \\\"that the business i\\ncame here for was just to find you.  but, look here, we must start or\\nwe shall miss our boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"our boat?\\\"  she frowned perplexedly, and then smiled.  \\\"oh, but i must\\ngo back to the hotel first:  i must leave a note--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"as many notes as you please.  you can write here.\\\" he drew out a\\nnote-case and one of the new stylographic pens.  \\\"i've even got an\\nenvelope--you see how everything's predestined!  there--steady the\\nthing on your knee, and i'll get the pen going in a second.  they have\\nto be humoured; wait--\\\"  he banged the hand that held the pen against\\nthe back of the bench.  \\\"it's like jerking down the mercury in a\\nthermometer: just a trick.  now try--\\\"\\n\\nshe laughed, and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on\\nhis note-case, began to write.  archer walked away a few steps, staring\\nwith radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby, who, in their turn, paused\\nto stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionably-dressed lady writing a\\nnote on her knee on a bench in the common.\\n\\nmadame olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope, wrote a name on it,\\nand put it into her pocket.  then she too stood up.\\n\\nthey walked back toward beacon street, and near the club archer caught\\nsight of the plush-lined \\\"herdic\\\" which had carried his note to the\\nparker house, and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing\\nhis brow at the corner hydrant.\\n\\n\\\"i told you everything was predestined!  here's a cab for us.  you\\nsee!\\\"  they laughed, astonished at the miracle of picking up a public\\nconveyance at that hour, and in that unlikely spot, in a city where\\ncab-stands were still a \\\"foreign\\\" novelty.\\n\\narcher, looking at his watch, saw that there was time to drive to the\\nparker house before going to the steamboat landing.  they rattled\\nthrough the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel.\\n\\narcher held out his hand for the letter.  \\\"shall i take it in?\\\" he\\nasked; but madame olenska, shaking her head, sprang out and disappeared\\nthrough the glazed doors.  it was barely half-past ten; but what if the\\nemissary, impatient for her reply, and not knowing how else to employ\\nhis time, were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks\\nat their elbows of whom archer had caught a glimpse as she went in?\\n\\nhe waited, pacing up and down before the herdic.  a sicilian youth with\\neyes like nastasia's offered to shine his boots, and an irish matron to\\nsell him peaches; and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot\\nmen with straw hats tilted far back, who glanced at him as they went\\nby.  he marvelled that the door should open so often, and that all the\\npeople it let out should look so like each other, and so like all the\\nother hot men who, at that hour, through the length and breadth of the\\nland, were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of\\nhotels.\\n\\nand then, suddenly, came a face that he could not relate to the other\\nfaces.  he caught but a flash of it, for his pacings had carried him to\\nthe farthest point of his beat, and it was in turning back to the hotel\\nthat he saw, in a group of typical countenances--the lank and weary,\\nthe round and surprised, the lantern-jawed and mild--this other face\\nthat was so many more things at once, and things so different.  it was\\nthat of a young man, pale too, and half-extinguished by the heat, or\\nworry, or both, but somehow, quicker, vivider, more conscious; or\\nperhaps seeming so because he was so different.  archer hung a moment\\non a thin thread of memory, but it snapped and floated off with the\\ndisappearing face--apparently that of some foreign business man,\\nlooking doubly foreign in such a setting.  he vanished in the stream of\\npassersby, and archer resumed his patrol.\\n\\nhe did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel, and\\nhis unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that, if\\nmadame olenska was so long in reappearing, it could only be because she\\nhad met the emissary and been waylaid by him.  at the thought archer's\\napprehension rose to anguish.\\n\\n\\\"if she doesn't come soon i'll go in and find her,\\\" he said.\\n\\nthe doors swung open again and she was at his side.  they got into the\\nherdic, and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had\\nbeen absent just three minutes.  in the clatter of loose windows that\\nmade talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to\\nthe wharf.\\n\\n\\nseated side by side on a bench of the half-empty boat they found that\\nthey had hardly anything to say to each other, or rather that what they\\nhad to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their\\nrelease and their isolation.\\n\\nas the paddle-wheels began to turn, and wharves and shipping to recede\\nthrough the veil of heat, it seemed to archer that everything in the\\nold familiar world of habit was receding also.  he longed to ask madame\\nolenska if she did not have the same feeling: the feeling that they\\nwere starting on some long voyage from which they might never return.\\nbut he was afraid to say it, or anything else that might disturb the\\ndelicate balance of her trust in him.  in reality he had no wish to\\nbetray that trust.  there had been days and nights when the memory of\\ntheir kiss had burned and burned on his lips; the day before even, on\\nthe drive to portsmouth, the thought of her had run through him like\\nfire; but now that she was beside him, and they were drifting forth\\ninto this unknown world, they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper\\nnearness that a touch may sunder.\\n\\nas the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about\\nthem and the bay broke up into long oily undulations, then into ripples\\ntipped with spray.  the fog of sultriness still hung over the city, but\\nahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters, and distant promontories\\nwith light-houses in the sun.  madame olenska, leaning back against the\\nboat-rail, drank in the coolness between parted lips.  she had wound a\\nlong veil about her hat, but it left her face uncovered, and archer was\\nstruck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression.  she seemed to take\\ntheir adventure as a matter of course, and to be neither in fear of\\nunexpected encounters, nor (what was worse) unduly elated by their\\npossibility.\\n\\nin the bare dining-room of the inn, which he had hoped they would have\\nto themselves, they found a strident party of innocent-looking young\\nmen and women--school-teachers on a holiday, the landlord told\\nthem--and archer's heart sank at the idea of having to talk through\\ntheir noise.\\n\\n\\\"this is hopeless--i'll ask for a private room,\\\" he said; and madame\\nolenska, without offering any objection, waited while he went in search\\nof it.  the room opened on a long wooden verandah, with the sea coming\\nin at the windows.  it was bare and cool, with a table covered with a\\ncoarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a\\nblueberry pie under a cage.  no more guileless-looking cabinet\\nparticulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple: archer\\nfancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile\\nwith which madame olenska sat down opposite to him.  a woman who had\\nrun away from her husband--and reputedly with another man--was likely\\nto have mastered the art of taking things for granted; but something in\\nthe quality of her composure took the edge from his irony.  by being so\\nquiet, so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the\\nconventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural\\nthing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey lunched slowly and meditatively, with mute intervals between\\nrushes of talk; for, the spell once broken, they had much to say, and\\nyet moments when saying became the mere accompaniment to long duologues\\nof silence.  archer kept the talk from his own affairs, not with\\nconscious intention but because he did not want to miss a word of her\\nhistory; and leaning on the table, her chin resting on her clasped\\nhands, she talked to him of the year and a half since they had met.\\n\\nshe had grown tired of what people called \\\"society\\\"; new york was kind,\\nit was almost oppressively hospitable; she should never forget the way\\nin which it had welcomed her back; but after the first flush of novelty\\nshe had found herself, as she phrased it, too \\\"different\\\" to care for\\nthe things it cared about--and so she had decided to try washington,\\nwhere one was supposed to meet more varieties of people and of opinion.\\nand on the whole she should probably settle down in washington, and\\nmake a home there for poor medora, who had worn out the patience of all\\nher other relations just at the time when she most needed looking after\\nand protecting from matrimonial perils.\\n\\n\\\"but dr. carver--aren't you afraid of dr. carver?  i hear he's been\\nstaying with you at the blenkers'.\\\"\\n\\nshe smiled.  \\\"oh, the carver danger is over.  dr. carver is a very\\nclever man.  he wants a rich wife to finance his plans, and medora is\\nsimply a good advertisement as a convert.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"a convert to what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"to all sorts of new and crazy social schemes.  but, do you know, they\\ninterest me more than the blind conformity to tradition--somebody\\nelse's tradition--that i see among our own friends.  it seems stupid to\\nhave discovered america only to make it into a copy of another\\ncountry.\\\"  she smiled across the table.  \\\"do you suppose christopher\\ncolumbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the opera with\\nthe selfridge merrys?\\\"\\n\\narcher changed colour.  \\\"and beaufort--do you say these things to\\nbeaufort?\\\" he asked abruptly.\\n\\n\\\"i haven't seen him for a long time.  but i used to; and he\\nunderstands.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, it's what i've always told you; you don't like us. and you like\\nbeaufort because he's so unlike us.\\\" he looked about the bare room and\\nout at the bare beach and the row of stark white village houses strung\\nalong the shore.  \\\"we're damnably dull.  we've no character, no colour,\\nno variety.--i wonder,\\\" he broke out, \\\"why you don't go back?\\\"\\n\\nher eyes darkened, and he expected an indignant rejoinder.  but she sat\\nsilent, as if thinking over what he had said, and he grew frightened\\nlest she should answer that she wondered too.\\n\\nat length she said:  \\\"i believe it's because of you.\\\"\\n\\nit was impossible to make the confession more dispassionately, or in a\\ntone less encouraging to the vanity of the person addressed.  archer\\nreddened to the temples, but dared not move or speak: it was as if her\\nwords had been some rare butterfly that the least motion might drive\\noff on startled wings, but that might gather a flock about it if it\\nwere left undisturbed.\\n\\n\\\"at least,\\\" she continued, \\\"it was you who made me understand that\\nunder the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate\\nthat even those i most cared for in my other life look cheap in\\ncomparison.  i don't know how to explain myself\\\"--she drew together her\\ntroubled brows--\\\"but it seems as if i'd never before understood with\\nhow much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures\\nmay be paid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"exquisite pleasures--it's something to have had them!\\\" he felt like\\nretorting; but the appeal in her eyes kept him silent.\\n\\n\\\"i want,\\\" she went on, \\\"to be perfectly honest with you--and with\\nmyself.  for a long time i've hoped this chance would come: that i\\nmight tell you how you've helped me, what you've made of me--\\\"\\n\\narcher sat staring beneath frowning brows.  he interrupted her with a\\nlaugh.  \\\"and what do you make out that you've made of me?\\\"\\n\\nshe paled a little.  \\\"of you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes: for i'm of your making much more than you ever were of mine.  i'm\\nthe man who married one woman because another one told him to.\\\"\\n\\nher paleness turned to a fugitive flush.  \\\"i thought--you promised--you\\nwere not to say such things today.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--how like a woman!  none of you will ever see a bad business\\nthrough!\\\"\\n\\nshe lowered her voice.  \\\"is it a bad business--for may?\\\"\\n\\nhe stood in the window, drumming against the raised sash, and feeling\\nin every fibre the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her\\ncousin's name.\\n\\n\\\"for that's the thing we've always got to think of--haven't we--by your\\nown showing?\\\" she insisted.\\n\\n\\\"my own showing?\\\" he echoed, his blank eyes still on the sea.\\n\\n\\\"or if not,\\\" she continued, pursuing her own thought with a painful\\napplication, \\\"if it's not worth while to have given up, to have missed\\nthings, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and\\nmisery--then everything i came home for, everything that made my other\\nlife seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took\\naccount of them--all these things are a sham or a dream--\\\"\\n\\nhe turned around without moving from his place.  \\\"and in that case\\nthere's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?\\\" he concluded for\\nher.\\n\\nher eyes were clinging to him desperately.  \\\"oh, is there no reason?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage.  my\\nmarriage,\\\" he said savagely, \\\"isn't going to be a sight to keep you\\nhere.\\\"  she made no answer, and he went on:  \\\"what's the use?  you gave\\nme my first glimpse of a real life, and at the same moment you asked me\\nto go on with a sham one.  it's beyond human enduring--that's all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, don't say that; when i'm enduring it!\\\" she burst out, her eyes\\nfilling.\\n\\nher arms had dropped along the table, and she sat with her face\\nabandoned to his gaze as if in the recklessness of a desperate peril.\\nthe face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person, with\\nthe soul behind it: archer stood dumb, overwhelmed by what it suddenly\\ntold him.\\n\\n\\\"you too--oh, all this time, you too?\\\"\\n\\nfor answer, she let the tears on her lids overflow and run slowly\\ndownward.\\n\\nhalf the width of the room was still between them, and neither made any\\nshow of moving.  archer was conscious of a curious indifference to her\\nbodily presence: he would hardly have been aware of it if one of the\\nhands she had flung out on the table had not drawn his gaze as on the\\noccasion when, in the little twenty-third street house, he had kept his\\neye on it in order not to look at her face.  now his imagination spun\\nabout the hand as about the edge of a vortex; but still he made no\\neffort to draw nearer.  he had known the love that is fed on caresses\\nand feeds them; but this passion that was closer than his bones was not\\nto be superficially satisfied.  his one terror was to do anything which\\nmight efface the sound and impression of her words; his one thought,\\nthat he should never again feel quite alone.\\n\\nbut after a moment the sense of waste and ruin overcame him.  there\\nthey were, close together and safe and shut in; yet so chained to their\\nseparate destinies that they might as well have been half the world\\napart.\\n\\n\\\"what's the use--when you will go back?\\\" he broke out, a great hopeless\\nhow on earth can i keep you?  crying out to her beneath his words.\\n\\nshe sat motionless, with lowered lids.  \\\"oh--i shan't go yet!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"not yet?  some time, then?  some time that you already foresee?\\\"\\n\\nat that she raised her clearest eyes.  \\\"i promise you: not as long as\\nyou hold out.  not as long as we can look straight at each other like\\nthis.\\\"\\n\\nhe dropped into his chair.  what her answer really said was:  \\\"if you\\nlift a finger you'll drive me back: back to all the abominations you\\nknow of, and all the temptations you half guess.\\\"  he understood it as\\nclearly as if she had uttered the words, and the thought kept him\\nanchored to his side of the table in a kind of moved and sacred\\nsubmission.\\n\\n\\\"what a life for you!--\\\" he groaned.\\n\\n\\\"oh--as long as it's a part of yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and mine a part of yours?\\\"\\n\\nshe nodded.\\n\\n\\\"and that's to be all--for either of us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well; it is all, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\nat that he sprang up, forgetting everything but the sweetness of her\\nface.  she rose too, not as if to meet him or to flee from him, but\\nquietly, as though the worst of the task were done and she had only to\\nwait; so quietly that, as he came close, her outstretched hands acted\\nnot as a check but as a guide to him.  they fell into his, while her\\narms, extended but not rigid, kept him far enough off to let her\\nsurrendered face say the rest.\\n\\nthey may have stood in that way for a long time, or only for a few\\nmoments; but it was long enough for her silence to communicate all she\\nhad to say, and for him to feel that only one thing mattered.  he must\\ndo nothing to make this meeting their last; he must leave their future\\nin her care, asking only that she should keep fast hold of it.\\n\\n\\\"don't--don't be unhappy,\\\" she said, with a break in her voice, as she\\ndrew her hands away; and he answered:  \\\"you won't go back--you won't go\\nback?\\\" as if it were the one possibility he could not bear.\\n\\n\\\"i won't go back,\\\" she said; and turning away she opened the door and\\nled the way into the public dining-room.\\n\\nthe strident school-teachers were gathering up their possessions\\npreparatory to a straggling flight to the wharf; across the beach lay\\nthe white steam-boat at the pier; and over the sunlit waters boston\\nloomed in a line of haze.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nonce more on the boat, and in the presence of others, archer felt a\\ntranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him.\\n\\nthe day, according to any current valuation, had been a rather\\nridiculous failure; he had not so much as touched madame olenska's hand\\nwith his lips, or extracted one word from her that gave promise of\\nfarther opportunities.  nevertheless, for a man sick with unsatisfied\\nlove, and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his\\npassion, he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted.  it\\nwas the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others\\nand their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet\\ntranquillized him; a balance not artfully calculated, as her tears and\\nher falterings showed, but resulting naturally from her unabashed\\nsincerity.  it filled him with a tender awe, now the danger was over,\\nand made him thank the fates that no personal vanity, no sense of\\nplaying a part before sophisticated witnesses, had tempted him to tempt\\nher.  even after they had clasped hands for good-bye at the fall river\\nstation, and he had turned away alone, the conviction remained with him\\nof having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed.\\n\\nhe wandered back to the club, and went and sat alone in the deserted\\nlibrary, turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second\\nof their hours together.  it was clear to him, and it grew more clear\\nunder closer scrutiny, that if she should finally decide on returning\\nto europe--returning to her husband--it would not be because her old\\nlife tempted her, even on the new terms offered.  no: she would go only\\nif she felt herself becoming a temptation to archer, a temptation to\\nfall away from the standard they had both set up.  her choice would be\\nto stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer; and it\\ndepended on himself to keep her just there, safe but secluded.\\n\\nin the train these thoughts were still with him.  they enclosed him in\\na kind of golden haze, through which the faces about him looked remote\\nand indistinct: he had a feeling that if he spoke to his\\nfellow-travellers they would not understand what he was saying.  in\\nthis state of abstraction he found himself, the following morning,\\nwaking to the reality of a stifling september day in new york.  the\\nheat-withered faces in the long train streamed past him, and he\\ncontinued to stare at them through the same golden blur; but suddenly,\\nas he left the station, one of the faces detached itself, came closer\\nand forced itself upon his consciousness.  it was, as he instantly\\nrecalled, the face of the young man he had seen, the day before,\\npassing out of the parker house, and had noted as not conforming to\\ntype, as not having an american hotel face.\\n\\nthe same thing struck him now; and again he became aware of a dim stir\\nof former associations.  the young man stood looking about him with the\\ndazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of american\\ntravel; then he advanced toward archer, lifted his hat, and said in\\nenglish:  \\\"surely, monsieur, we met in london?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, to be sure: in london!\\\"  archer grasped his hand with curiosity\\nand sympathy.  \\\"so you did get here, after all?\\\" he exclaimed, casting\\na wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young\\ncarfry's french tutor.\\n\\n\\\"oh, i got here--yes,\\\" m. riviere smiled with drawn lips.  \\\"but not for\\nlong; i return the day after tomorrow.\\\" he stood grasping his light\\nvalise in one neatly gloved hand, and gazing anxiously, perplexedly,\\nalmost appealingly, into archer's face.\\n\\n\\\"i wonder, monsieur, since i've had the good luck to run across you, if\\ni might--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i was just going to suggest it: come to luncheon, won't you?  down\\ntown, i mean: if you'll look me up in my office i'll take you to a very\\ndecent restaurant in that quarter.\\\"\\n\\n\\nm. riviere was visibly touched and surprised.  \\\"you're too kind.  but i\\nwas only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of\\nconveyance.  there are no porters, and no one here seems to listen--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i know: our american stations must surprise you.  when you ask for a\\nporter they give you chewing-gum.  but if you'll come along i'll\\nextricate you; and you must really lunch with me, you know.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man, after a just perceptible hesitation, replied, with\\nprofuse thanks, and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction,\\nthat he was already engaged; but when they had reached the comparative\\nreassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon.\\n\\narcher, at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office, fixed an hour\\nand scribbled his address, which the frenchman pocketed with reiterated\\nthanks and a wide flourish of his hat.  a horse-car received him, and\\narcher walked away.\\n\\npunctually at the hour m. riviere appeared, shaved, smoothed-out, but\\nstill unmistakably drawn and serious.  archer was alone in his office,\\nand the young man, before accepting the seat he proffered, began\\nabruptly: \\\"i believe i saw you, sir, yesterday in boston.\\\"\\n\\nthe statement was insignificant enough, and archer was about to frame\\nan assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet\\nilluminating in his visitor's insistent gaze.\\n\\n\\\"it is extraordinary, very extraordinary,\\\" m. riviere continued, \\\"that\\nwe should have met in the circumstances in which i find myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what circumstances?\\\" archer asked, wondering a little crudely if he\\nneeded money.\\n\\nm. riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes.  \\\"i have come,\\nnot to look for employment, as i spoke of doing when we last met, but\\non a special mission--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--!\\\" archer exclaimed.  in a flash the two meetings had connected\\nthemselves in his mind.  he paused to take in the situation thus\\nsuddenly lighted up for him, and m. riviere also remained silent, as if\\naware that what he had said was enough.\\n\\n\\\"a special mission,\\\" archer at length repeated.\\n\\nthe young frenchman, opening his palms, raised them slightly, and the\\ntwo men continued to look at each other across the office-desk till\\narcher roused himself to say:  \\\"do sit down\\\"; whereupon m. riviere\\nbowed, took a distant chair, and again waited.\\n\\n\\\"it was about this mission that you wanted to consult me?\\\" archer\\nfinally asked.\\n\\nm. riviere bent his head.  \\\"not in my own behalf: on that score i--i\\nhave fully dealt with myself.  i should like--if i may--to speak to you\\nabout the countess olenska.\\\"\\n\\narcher had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming;\\nbut when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he\\nhad been caught by a bent-back branch in a thicket.\\n\\n\\\"and on whose behalf,\\\" he said, \\\"do you wish to do this?\\\"\\n\\nm. riviere met the question sturdily.  \\\"well--i might say hers, if it\\ndid not sound like a liberty.  shall i say instead: on behalf of\\nabstract justice?\\\"\\n\\narcher considered him ironically.  \\\"in other words: you are count\\nolenski's messenger?\\\"\\n\\nhe saw his blush more darkly reflected in m. riviere's sallow\\ncountenance.  \\\"not to you, monsieur.  if i come to you, it is on quite\\nother grounds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what right have you, in the circumstances, to be on any other ground?\\\"\\narcher retorted.  \\\"if you're an emissary you're an emissary.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man considered.  \\\"my mission is over: as far as the countess\\nolenska goes, it has failed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i can't help that,\\\" archer rejoined on the same note of irony.\\n\\n\\\"no: but you can help--\\\"  m. riviere paused, turned his hat about in\\nhis still carefully gloved hands, looked into its lining and then back\\nat archer's face.  \\\"you can help, monsieur, i am convinced, to make it\\nequally a failure with her family.\\\"\\n\\narcher pushed back his chair and stood up.  \\\"well--and by god i will!\\\"\\nhe exclaimed.  he stood with his hands in his pockets, staring down\\nwrathfully at the little frenchman, whose face, though he too had\\nrisen, was still an inch or two below the line of archer's eyes.\\n\\nm. riviere paled to his normal hue: paler than that his complexion\\ncould hardly turn.\\n\\n\\\"why the devil,\\\" archer explosively continued, \\\"should you have\\nthought--since i suppose you're appealing to me on the ground of my\\nrelationship to madame olenska--that i should take a view contrary to\\nthe rest of her family?\\\"\\n\\nthe change of expression in m. riviere's face was for a time his only\\nanswer.  his look passed from timidity to absolute distress: for a\\nyoung man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult\\nto appear more disarmed and defenceless.  \\\"oh, monsieur--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i can't imagine,\\\" archer continued, \\\"why you should have come to me\\nwhen there are others so much nearer to the countess; still less why\\nyou thought i should be more accessible to the arguments i suppose you\\nwere sent over with.\\\"\\n\\n\\nm. riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility.  \\\"the\\narguments i want to present to you, monsieur, are my own and not those\\ni was sent over with.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"then i see still less reason for listening to them.\\\"\\n\\nm. riviere again looked into his hat, as if considering whether these\\nlast words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone.\\nthen he spoke with sudden decision.  \\\"monsieur--will you tell me one\\nthing?  is it my right to be here that you question?  or do you perhaps\\nbelieve the whole matter to be already closed?\\\"\\n\\nhis quiet insistence made archer feel the clumsiness of his own\\nbluster.  m. riviere had succeeded in imposing himself:  archer,\\nreddening slightly, dropped into his chair again, and signed to the\\nyoung man to be seated.\\n\\n\\\"i beg your pardon: but why isn't the matter closed?\\\"\\n\\n\\nm. riviere gazed back at him with anguish.  \\\"you do, then, agree with\\nthe rest of the family that, in face of the new proposals i have\\nbrought, it is hardly possible for madame olenska not to return to her\\nhusband?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"good god!\\\" archer exclaimed; and his visitor gave out a low murmur of\\nconfirmation.\\n\\n\\\"before seeing her, i saw--at count olenski's request--mr. lovell\\nmingott, with whom i had several talks before going to boston.  i\\nunderstand that he represents his mother's view; and that mrs. manson\\nmingott's influence is great throughout her family.\\\"\\n\\narcher sat silent, with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding\\nprecipice.  the discovery that he had been excluded from a share in\\nthese negotiations, and even from the knowledge that they were on foot,\\ncaused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was\\nlearning.  he saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult\\nhim it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no\\nlonger on their side; and he recalled, with a start of comprehension, a\\nremark of may's during their drive home from mrs. manson mingott's on\\nthe day of the archery meeting:  \\\"perhaps, after all, ellen would be\\nhappier with her husband.\\\"\\n\\neven in the tumult of new discoveries archer remembered his indignant\\nexclamation, and the fact that since then his wife had never named\\nmadame olenska to him.  her careless allusion had no doubt been the\\nstraw held up to see which way the wind blew; the result had been\\nreported to the family, and thereafter archer had been tacitly omitted\\nfrom their counsels.  he admired the tribal discipline which made may\\nbow to this decision.  she would not have done so, he knew, had her\\nconscience protested; but she probably shared the family view that\\nmadame olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a\\nseparated one, and that there was no use in discussing the case with\\nnewland, who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the\\nmost fundamental things for granted.\\n\\narcher looked up and met his visitor's anxious gaze.  \\\"don't you know,\\nmonsieur--is it possible you don't know--that the family begin to doubt\\nif they have the right to advise the countess to refuse her husband's\\nlast proposals?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the proposals you brought?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the proposals i brought.\\\"\\n\\nit was on archer's lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not\\nknow was no concern of m. riviere's; but something in the humble and\\nyet courageous tenacity of m. riviere's gaze made him reject this\\nconclusion, and he met the young man's question with another.  \\\"what is\\nyour object in speaking to me of this?\\\"\\n\\nhe had not to wait a moment for the answer.  \\\"to beg you, monsieur--to\\nbeg you with all the force i'm capable of--not to let her go back.--oh,\\ndon't let her!\\\" m. riviere exclaimed.\\n\\narcher looked at him with increasing astonishment.  there was no\\nmistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his\\ndetermination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the\\nboard but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record.  archer\\nconsidered.\\n\\n\\\"may i ask,\\\" he said at length, \\\"if this is the line you took with the\\ncountess olenska?\\\"\\n\\n\\nm. riviere reddened, but his eyes did not falter.  \\\"no, monsieur: i\\naccepted my mission in good faith.  i really believed--for reasons i\\nneed not trouble you with--that it would be better for madame olenska\\nto recover her situation, her fortune, the social consideration that\\nher husband's standing gives her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"so i supposed: you could hardly have accepted such a mission\\notherwise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i should not have accepted it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, then--?\\\"  archer paused again, and their eyes met in another\\nprotracted scrutiny.\\n\\n\\\"ah, monsieur, after i had seen her, after i had listened to her, i\\nknew she was better off here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"you knew--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"monsieur, i discharged my mission faithfully: i put the count's\\narguments, i stated his offers, without adding any comment of my own.\\nthe countess was good enough to listen patiently; she carried her\\ngoodness so far as to see me twice; she considered impartially all i\\nhad come to say.  and it was in the course of these two talks that i\\nchanged my mind, that i came to see things differently.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"may i ask what led to this change?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"simply seeing the change in her,\\\" m. riviere replied.\\n\\n\\\"the change in her?  then you knew her before?\\\"\\n\\nthe young man's colour again rose.  \\\"i used to see her in her husband's\\nhouse.  i have known count olenski for many years.  you can imagine\\nthat he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission.\\\"\\n\\narcher's gaze, wandering away to the blank walls of the office, rested\\non a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the\\npresident of the united states.  that such a conversation should be\\ngoing on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his\\nrule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent.\\n\\n\\\"the change--what sort of a change?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, monsieur, if i could tell you!\\\"  m. riviere paused.  \\\"tenez--the\\ndiscovery, i suppose, of what i'd never thought of before: that she's\\nan american.  and that if you're an american of her kind--of your\\nkind--things that are accepted in certain other societies, or at least\\nput up with as part of a general convenient give-and-take--become\\nunthinkable, simply unthinkable.  if madame olenska's relations\\nunderstood what these things were, their opposition to her returning\\nwould no doubt be as unconditional as her own; but they seem to regard\\nher husband's wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing\\nfor domestic life.\\\"  m. riviere paused, and then added:  \\\"whereas it's\\nfar from being as simple as that.\\\"\\n\\narcher looked back to the president of the united states, and then down\\nat his desk and at the papers scattered on it.  for a second or two he\\ncould not trust himself to speak.  during this interval he heard m.\\nriviere's chair pushed back, and was aware that the young man had\\nrisen.  when he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved\\nas himself.\\n\\n\\\"thank you,\\\" archer said simply.\\n\\n\\\"there's nothing to thank me for, monsieur: it is i, rather--\\\"  m.\\nriviere broke off, as if speech for him too were difficult.  \\\"i should\\nlike, though,\\\" he continued in a firmer voice, \\\"to add one thing.  you\\nasked me if i was in count olenski's employ.  i am at this moment: i\\nreturned to him, a few months ago, for reasons of private necessity\\nsuch as may happen to any one who has persons, ill and older persons,\\ndependent on him.  but from the moment that i have taken the step of\\ncoming here to say these things to you i consider myself discharged,\\nand i shall tell him so on my return, and give him the reasons.  that's\\nall, monsieur.\\\"\\n\\nm. riviere bowed and drew back a step.\\n\\n\\\"thank you,\\\" archer said again, as their hands met.\\n\\n\\nevery year on the fifteenth of october fifth avenue opened its\\nshutters, unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of\\nwindow-curtains.\\n\\nby the first of november this household ritual was over, and society\\nhad begun to look about and take stock of itself.  by the fifteenth the\\nseason was in full blast, opera and theatres were putting forth their\\nnew attractions, dinner-engagements were accumulating, and dates for\\ndances being fixed.  and punctually at about this time mrs. archer\\nalways said that new york was very much changed.\\n\\nobserving it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was\\nable, with the help of mr. sillerton jackson and miss sophy, to trace\\neach new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up\\nbetween the ordered rows of social vegetables.  it had been one of the\\namusements of archer's youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of\\nhis mother's, and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of\\ndisintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked.  for new york, to\\nmrs. archer's mind, never changed without changing for the worse; and\\nin this view miss sophy jackson heartily concurred.\\n\\nmr. sillerton jackson, as became a man of the world, suspended his\\njudgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations\\nof the ladies.  but even he never denied that new york had changed; and\\nnewland archer, in the winter of the second year of his marriage, was\\nhimself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was\\ncertainly changing.\\n\\nthese points had been raised, as usual, at mrs. archer's thanksgiving\\ndinner.  at the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks\\nfor the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful\\nthough not embittered stock of her world, and wonder what there was to\\nbe thankful for.  at any rate, not the state of society; society, if it\\ncould be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down\\nbiblical imprecations--and in fact, every one knew what the reverend\\ndr. ashmore meant when he chose a text from jeremiah (chap. ii., verse\\n25) for his thanksgiving sermon.  dr. ashmore, the new rector of st.\\nmatthew's, had been chosen because he was very \\\"advanced\\\": his sermons\\nwere considered bold in thought and novel in language.  when he\\nfulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its \\\"trend\\\";\\nand to mrs. archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel\\nherself part of a community that was trending.\\n\\n\\\"there's no doubt that dr. ashmore is right: there is a marked trend,\\\"\\nshe said, as if it were something visible and measurable, like a crack\\nin a house.\\n\\n\\\"it was odd, though, to preach about it on thanksgiving,\\\" miss jackson\\nopined; and her hostess drily rejoined:  \\\"oh, he means us to give\\nthanks for what's left.\\\"\\n\\narcher had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his\\nmother's; but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge, as he\\nlistened to an enumeration of the changes, that the \\\"trend\\\" was visible.\\n\\n\\\"the extravagance in dress--\\\" miss jackson began.  \\\"sillerton took me\\nto the first night of the opera, and i can only tell you that jane\\nmerry's dress was the only one i recognised from last year; and even\\nthat had had the front panel changed.  yet i know she got it out from\\nworth only two years ago, because my seamstress always goes in to make\\nover her paris dresses before she wears them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, jane merry is one of us,\\\" said mrs. archer sighing, as if it were\\nnot such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning\\nto flaunt abroad their paris dresses as soon as they were out of the\\ncustom house, instead of letting them mellow under lock and key, in the\\nmanner of mrs. archer's contemporaries.\\n\\n\\\"yes; she's one of the few.  in my youth,\\\" miss jackson rejoined, \\\"it\\nwas considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions; and amy\\nsillerton has always told me that in boston the rule was to put away\\none's paris dresses for two years.  old mrs. baxter pennilow, who did\\neverything handsomely, used to import twelve a year, two velvet, two\\nsatin, two silk, and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere.\\nit was a standing order, and as she was ill for two years before she\\ndied they found forty-eight worth dresses that had never been taken out\\nof tissue paper; and when the girls left off their mourning they were\\nable to wear the first lot at the symphony concerts without looking in\\nadvance of the fashion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, well, boston is more conservative than new york; but i always\\nthink it's a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her french dresses for\\none season,\\\" mrs. archer conceded.\\n\\n\\\"it was beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap\\nher new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived: i must say at\\ntimes it takes all regina's distinction not to look like ... like ...\\\"\\nmiss jackson glanced around the table, caught janey's bulging gaze, and\\ntook refuge in an unintelligible murmur.\\n\\n\\\"like her rivals,\\\" said mr. sillerton jackson, with the air of\\nproducing an epigram.\\n\\n\\\"oh,--\\\" the ladies murmured; and mrs. archer added, partly to distract\\nher daughter's attention from forbidden topics:  \\\"poor regina!  her\\nthanksgiving hasn't been a very cheerful one, i'm afraid.  have you\\nheard the rumours about beaufort's speculations, sillerton?\\\"\\n\\nmr. jackson nodded carelessly.  every one had heard the rumours in\\nquestion, and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common\\nproperty.\\n\\na gloomy silence fell upon the party.  no one really liked beaufort,\\nand it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private\\nlife; but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his\\nwife's family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies.\\narcher's new york tolerated hypocrisy in private relations; but in\\nbusiness matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty.  it was a\\nlong time since any well-known banker had failed discreditably; but\\nevery one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the\\nfirm when the last event of the kind had happened.  it would be the\\nsame with the beauforts, in spite of his power and her popularity; not\\nall the leagued strength of the dallas connection would save poor\\nregina if there were any truth in the reports of her husband's unlawful\\nspeculations.\\n\\nthe talk took refuge in less ominous topics; but everything they\\ntouched on seemed to confirm mrs. archer's sense of an accelerated\\ntrend.\\n\\n\\\"of course, newland, i know you let dear may go to mrs. struthers's\\nsunday evenings--\\\" she began; and may interposed gaily:  \\\"oh, you know,\\neverybody goes to mrs. struthers's now; and she was invited to granny's\\nlast reception.\\\"\\n\\nit was thus, archer reflected, that new york managed its transitions:\\nconspiring to ignore them till they were well over, and then, in all\\ngood faith, imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age.\\nthere was always a traitor in the citadel; and after he (or generally\\nshe) had surrendered the keys, what was the use of pretending that it\\nwas impregnable?  once people had tasted of mrs. struthers's easy\\nsunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that\\nher champagne was transmuted shoe-polish.\\n\\n\\\"i know, dear, i know,\\\" mrs. archer sighed.  \\\"such things have to be, i\\nsuppose, as long as amusement is what people go out for; but i've never\\nquite forgiven your cousin madame olenska for being the first person to\\ncountenance mrs. struthers.\\\"\\n\\na sudden blush rose to young mrs. archer's face; it surprised her\\nhusband as much as the other guests about the table.  \\\"oh, ellen--\\\" she\\nmurmured, much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which\\nher parents might have said:  \\\"oh, the blenkers--.\\\"\\n\\nit was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention\\nof the countess olenska's name, since she had surprised and\\ninconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husband's advances;\\nbut on may's lips it gave food for thought, and archer looked at her\\nwith the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was\\nmost in the tone of her environment.\\n\\nhis mother, with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere, still\\ninsisted:  \\\"i've always thought that people like the countess olenska,\\nwho have lived in aristocratic societies, ought to help us to keep up\\nour social distinctions, instead of ignoring them.\\\"\\n\\nmay's blush remained permanently vivid: it seemed to have a\\nsignificance beyond that implied by the recognition of madame olenska's\\nsocial bad faith.\\n\\n\\\"i've no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners,\\\" said miss jackson\\ntartly.\\n\\n\\\"i don't think ellen cares for society; but nobody knows exactly what\\nshe does care for,\\\" may continued, as if she had been groping for\\nsomething noncommittal.\\n\\n\\\"ah, well--\\\" mrs. archer sighed again.\\n\\neverybody knew that the countess olenska was no longer in the good\\ngraces of her family.  even her devoted champion, old mrs. manson\\nmingott, had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her\\nhusband.  the mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud:\\ntheir sense of solidarity was too strong.  they had simply, as mrs.\\nwelland said, \\\"let poor ellen find her own level\\\"--and that,\\nmortifyingly and incomprehensibly, was in the dim depths where the\\nblenkers prevailed, and \\\"people who wrote\\\" celebrated their untidy\\nrites.  it was incredible, but it was a fact, that ellen, in spite of\\nall her opportunities and her privileges, had become simply \\\"bohemian.\\\"\\nthe fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in\\nnot returning to count olenski.  after all, a young woman's place was\\nunder her husband's roof, especially when she had left it in\\ncircumstances that ... well ... if one had cared to look into them ...\\n\\n\\\"madame olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen,\\\" said miss\\nsophy, with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when\\nshe knew that she was planting a dart.\\n\\n\\\"ah, that's the danger that a young woman like madame olenska is always\\nexposed to,\\\" mrs. archer mournfully agreed; and the ladies, on this\\nconclusion, gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the\\ndrawing-room, while archer and mr. sillerton jackson withdrew to the\\ngothic library.\\n\\nonce established before the grate, and consoling himself for the\\ninadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar, mr. jackson\\nbecame portentous and communicable.\\n\\n\\\"if the beaufort smash comes,\\\" he announced, \\\"there are going to be\\ndisclosures.\\\"\\n\\narcher raised his head quickly: he could never hear the name without\\nthe sharp vision of beaufort's heavy figure, opulently furred and shod,\\nadvancing through the snow at skuytercliff.\\n\\n\\\"there's bound to be,\\\" mr. jackson continued, \\\"the nastiest kind of a\\ncleaning up.  he hasn't spent all his money on regina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, well--that's discounted, isn't it?  my belief is he'll pull out\\nyet,\\\" said the young man, wanting to change the subject.\\n\\n\\\"perhaps--perhaps.  i know he was to see some of the influential people\\ntoday.  of course,\\\" mr. jackson reluctantly conceded, \\\"it's to be hoped\\nthey can tide him over--this time anyhow.  i shouldn't like to think of\\npoor regina's spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign\\nwatering-place for bankrupts.\\\"\\n\\narcher said nothing.  it seemed to him so natural--however tragic--that\\nmoney ill-gotten should be cruelly expiated, that his mind, hardly\\nlingering over mrs. beaufort's doom, wandered back to closer questions.\\nwhat was the meaning of may's blush when the countess olenska had been\\nmentioned?\\n\\nfour months had passed since the midsummer day that he and madame\\nolenska had spent together; and since then he had not seen her.  he\\nknew that she had returned to washington, to the little house which she\\nand medora manson had taken there: he had written to her once--a few\\nwords, asking when they were to meet again--and she had even more\\nbriefly replied: \\\"not yet.\\\"\\n\\nsince then there had been no farther communication between them, and he\\nhad built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned\\namong his secret thoughts and longings.  little by little it became the\\nscene of his real life, of his only rational activities; thither he\\nbrought the books he read, the ideas and feelings which nourished him,\\nhis judgments and his visions.  outside it, in the scene of his actual\\nlife, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency,\\nblundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view\\nas an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own\\nroom.  absent--that was what he was: so absent from everything most\\ndensely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him\\nto find they still imagined he was there.\\n\\nhe became aware that mr. jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to\\nfarther revelations.\\n\\n\\\"i don't know, of course, how far your wife's family are aware of what\\npeople say about--well, about madame olenska's refusal to accept her\\nhusband's latest offer.\\\"\\n\\narcher was silent, and mr. jackson obliquely continued: \\\"it's a\\npity--it's certainly a pity--that she refused it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"a pity?  in god's name, why?\\\"\\n\\nmr. jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it\\nto a glossy pump.\\n\\n\\\"well--to put it on the lowest ground--what's she going to live on now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"now--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"if beaufort--\\\"\\n\\narcher sprang up, his fist banging down on the black walnut-edge of the\\nwriting-table.  the wells of the brass double-inkstand danced in their\\nsockets.\\n\\n\\\"what the devil do you mean, sir?\\\"\\n\\nmr. jackson, shifting himself slightly in his chair, turned a tranquil\\ngaze on the young man's burning face.\\n\\n\\\"well--i have it on pretty good authority--in fact, on old catherine's\\nherself--that the family reduced countess olenska's allowance\\nconsiderably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband; and\\nas, by this refusal, she also forfeits the money settled on her when\\nshe married--which olenski was ready to make over to her if she\\nreturned--why, what the devil do you mean, my dear boy, by asking me\\nwhat i mean?\\\" mr. jackson good-humouredly retorted.\\n\\narcher moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes\\ninto the grate.\\n\\n\\\"i don't know anything of madame olenska's private affairs; but i don't\\nneed to, to be certain that what you insinuate--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, i don't: it's lefferts, for one,\\\" mr. jackson interposed.\\n\\n\\\"lefferts--who made love to her and got snubbed for it!\\\" archer broke\\nout contemptuously.\\n\\n\\\"ah--did he?\\\" snapped the other, as if this were exactly the fact he\\nhad been laying a trap for.  he still sat sideways from the fire, so\\nthat his hard old gaze held archer's face as if in a spring of steel.\\n\\n\\\"well, well: it's a pity she didn't go back before beaufort's cropper,\\\"\\nhe repeated.  \\\"if she goes now, and if he fails, it will only confirm\\nthe general impression: which isn't by any means peculiar to lefferts,\\nby the way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, she won't go back now: less than ever!\\\"  archer had no sooner said\\nit than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what mr.\\njackson had been waiting for.\\n\\nthe old gentleman considered him attentively.  \\\"that's your opinion,\\neh?  well, no doubt you know.  but everybody will tell you that the few\\npennies medora manson has left are all in beaufort's hands; and how the\\ntwo women are to keep their heads above water unless he does, i can't\\nimagine.  of course, madame olenska may still soften old catherine,\\nwho's been the most inexorably opposed to her staying; and old\\ncatherine could make her any allowance she chooses.  but we all know\\nthat she hates parting with good money; and the rest of the family have\\nno particular interest in keeping madame olenska here.\\\"\\n\\narcher was burning with unavailing wrath: he was exactly in the state\\nwhen a man is sure to do something stupid, knowing all the while that\\nhe is doing it.\\n\\nhe saw that mr. jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that\\nmadame olenska's differences with her grandmother and her other\\nrelations were not known to him, and that the old gentleman had drawn\\nhis own conclusions as to the reasons for archer's exclusion from the\\nfamily councils.  this fact warned archer to go warily; but the\\ninsinuations about beaufort made him reckless.  he was mindful,\\nhowever, if not of his own danger, at least of the fact that mr.\\njackson was under his mother's roof, and consequently his guest.  old\\nnew york scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality, and no\\ndiscussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a\\ndisagreement.\\n\\n\\\"shall we go up and join my mother?\\\" he suggested curtly, as mr.\\njackson's last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his\\nelbow.\\n\\non the drive homeward may remained oddly silent; through the darkness,\\nhe still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush.  what its menace\\nmeant he could not guess: but he was sufficiently warned by the fact\\nthat madame olenska's name had evoked it.\\n\\nthey went upstairs, and he turned into the library.  she usually\\nfollowed him; but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom.\\n\\n\\\"may!\\\" he called out impatiently; and she came back, with a slight\\nglance of surprise at his tone.\\n\\n\\\"this lamp is smoking again; i should think the servants might see that\\nit's kept properly trimmed,\\\" he grumbled nervously.\\n\\n\\\"i'm so sorry: it shan't happen again,\\\" she answered, in the firm\\nbright tone she had learned from her mother; and it exasperated archer\\nto feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger mr.\\nwelland.  she bent over to lower the wick, and as the light struck up\\non her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought:\\n\\\"how young she is!  for what endless years this life will have to go\\non!\\\"\\n\\nhe felt, with a kind of horror, his own strong youth and the bounding\\nblood in his veins.  \\\"look here,\\\" he said suddenly, \\\"i may have to go\\nto washington for a few days--soon; next week perhaps.\\\"\\n\\nher hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly.\\nthe heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face, but it\\npaled as she looked up.\\n\\n\\\"on business?\\\" she asked, in a tone which implied that there could be\\nno other conceivable reason, and that she had put the question\\nautomatically, as if merely to finish his own sentence.\\n\\n\\\"on business, naturally.  there's a patent case coming up before the\\nsupreme court--\\\"  he gave the name of the inventor, and went on\\nfurnishing details with all lawrence lefferts's practised glibness,\\nwhile she listened attentively, saying at intervals:  \\\"yes, i see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the change will do you good,\\\" she said simply, when he had finished;\\n\\\"and you must be sure to go and see ellen,\\\" she added, looking him\\nstraight in the eyes with her cloudless smile, and speaking in the tone\\nshe might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome\\nfamily duty.\\n\\nit was the only word that passed between them on the subject; but in\\nthe code in which they had both been trained it meant:  \\\"of course you\\nunderstand that i know all that people have been saying about ellen,\\nand heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to\\nreturn to her husband.  i also know that, for some reason you have not\\nchosen to tell me, you have advised her against this course, which all\\nthe older men of the family, as well as our grandmother, agree in\\napproving; and that it is owing to your encouragement that ellen defies\\nus all, and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which mr.\\nsillerton jackson probably gave you, this evening, the hint that has\\nmade you so irritable....  hints have indeed not been wanting; but\\nsince you appear unwilling to take them from others, i offer you this\\none myself, in the only form in which well-bred people of our kind can\\ncommunicate unpleasant things to each other: by letting you understand\\nthat i know you mean to see ellen when you are in washington, and are\\nperhaps going there expressly for that purpose; and that, since you are\\nsure to see her, i wish you to do so with my full and explicit\\napproval--and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the\\ncourse of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to.\\\"\\n\\nher hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this\\nmute message reached him.  she turned the wick down, lifted off the\\nglobe, and breathed on the sulky flame.\\n\\n\\\"they smell less if one blows them out,\\\" she explained, with her bright\\nhousekeeping air.  on the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwall street, the next day, had more reassuring reports of beaufort's\\nsituation.  they were not definite, but they were hopeful.  it was\\ngenerally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case\\nof emergency, and that he had done so with success; and that evening,\\nwhen mrs. beaufort appeared at the opera wearing her old smile and a\\nnew emerald necklace, society drew a breath of relief.\\n\\nnew york was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities.\\nso far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who\\nbroke the law of probity must pay; and every one was aware that even\\nbeaufort and beaufort's wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this\\nprinciple.  but to be obliged to offer them up would be not only\\npainful but inconvenient.  the disappearance of the beauforts would\\nleave a considerable void in their compact little circle; and those who\\nwere too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe\\nbewailed in advance the loss of the best ball-room in new york.\\n\\narcher had definitely made up his mind to go to washington.  he was\\nwaiting only for the opening of the law-suit of which he had spoken to\\nmay, so that its date might coincide with that of his visit; but on the\\nfollowing tuesday he learned from mr. letterblair that the case might\\nbe postponed for several weeks.  nevertheless, he went home that\\nafternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening.  the\\nchances were that may, who knew nothing of his professional life, and\\nhad never shown any interest in it, would not learn of the\\npostponement, should it take place, nor remember the names of the\\nlitigants if they were mentioned before her; and at any rate he could\\nno longer put off seeing madame olenska.  there were too many things\\nthat he must say to her.\\n\\non the wednesday morning, when he reached his office, mr. letterblair\\nmet him with a troubled face.  beaufort, after all, had not managed to\\n\\\"tide over\\\"; but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he\\nhad reassured his depositors, and heavy payments had poured into the\\nbank till the previous evening, when disturbing reports again began to\\npredominate.  in consequence, a run on the bank had begun, and its\\ndoors were likely to close before the day was over.  the ugliest things\\nwere being said of beaufort's dastardly manoeuvre, and his failure\\npromised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of wall\\nstreet.\\n\\nthe extent of the calamity left mr. letterblair white and\\nincapacitated.  \\\"i've seen bad things in my time; but nothing as bad as\\nthis.  everybody we know will be hit, one way or another.  and what\\nwill be done about mrs. beaufort?  what can be done about her?  i pity\\nmrs. manson mingott as much as anybody: coming at her age, there's no\\nknowing what effect this affair may have on her.  she always believed\\nin beaufort--she made a friend of him!  and there's the whole dallas\\nconnection: poor mrs. beaufort is related to every one of you.  her\\nonly chance would be to leave her husband--yet how can any one tell her\\nso?  her duty is at his side; and luckily she seems always to have been\\nblind to his private weaknesses.\\\"\\n\\nthere was a knock, and mr. letterblair turned his head sharply.  \\\"what\\nis it?  i can't be disturbed.\\\"\\n\\na clerk brought in a letter for archer and withdrew.  recognising his\\nwife's hand, the young man opened the envelope and read:  \\\"won't you\\nplease come up town as early as you can?  granny had a slight stroke\\nlast night.  in some mysterious way she found out before any one else\\nthis awful news about the bank.  uncle lovell is away shooting, and the\\nidea of the disgrace has made poor papa so nervous that he has a\\ntemperature and can't leave his room.  mamma needs you dreadfully, and\\ni do hope you can get away at once and go straight to granny's.\\\"\\n\\narcher handed the note to his senior partner, and a few minutes later\\nwas crawling northward in a crowded horse-car, which he exchanged at\\nfourteenth street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the fifth\\navenue line.  it was after twelve o'clock when this laborious vehicle\\ndropped him at old catherine's.  the sitting-room window on the ground\\nfloor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure\\nof her daughter, mrs. welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she\\ncaught sight of archer; and at the door he was met by may.  the hall\\nwore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly\\ninvaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a\\ndoctor's bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters\\nand cards had already piled up unheeded.\\n\\nmay looked pale but smiling: dr. bencomb, who had just come for the\\nsecond time, took a more hopeful view, and mrs. mingott's dauntless\\ndetermination to live and get well was already having an effect on her\\nfamily.  may led archer into the old lady's sitting-room, where the\\nsliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the\\nheavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them; and here mrs. welland\\ncommunicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the\\ncatastrophe.  it appeared that the evening before something dreadful\\nand mysterious had happened.  at about eight o'clock, just after mrs.\\nmingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after\\ndinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the\\nservants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received.\\n\\nthe butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting-room\\ndoor, announcing:  \\\"mrs. julius beaufort\\\"--and had then closed it again\\non the two ladies.  they must have been together, he thought, about an\\nhour.  when mrs. mingott's bell rang mrs. beaufort had already slipped\\naway unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone\\nin her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room.\\nshe seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete\\ncontrol of her body and brain.  the mulatto maid put her to bed,\\nbrought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the\\nroom, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again,\\nand the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old\\ncatherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting\\nup against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little\\nhand hanging limp from its huge arm.\\n\\nthe stroke had clearly been a slight one, for she was able to\\narticulate and to make her wishes known; and soon after the doctor's\\nfirst visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles.  but\\nthe alarm had been great; and proportionately great was the indignation\\nwhen it was gathered from mrs. mingott's fragmentary phrases that\\nregina beaufort had come to ask her--incredible effrontery!--to back up\\nher husband, see them through--not to \\\"desert\\\" them, as she called\\nit--in fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their\\nmonstrous dishonour.\\n\\n\\\"i said to her:  'honour's always been honour, and honesty honesty, in\\nmanson mingott's house, and will be till i'm carried out of it feet\\nfirst,'\\\" the old woman had stammered into her daughter's ear, in the\\nthick voice of the partly paralysed.  \\\"and when she said:  'but my\\nname, auntie--my name's regina dallas,' i said:  'it was beaufort when\\nhe covered you with jewels, and it's got to stay beaufort now that he's\\ncovered you with shame.'\\\"\\n\\nso much, with tears and gasps of horror, mrs. welland imparted,\\nblanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to\\nfix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable.  \\\"if only i could\\nkeep it from your father-in-law: he always says: 'augusta, for pity's\\nsake, don't destroy my last illusions'--and how am i to prevent his\\nknowing these horrors?\\\" the poor lady wailed.\\n\\n\\\"after all, mamma, he won't have seen them,\\\" her daughter suggested;\\nand mrs. welland sighed:  \\\"ah, no; thank heaven he's safe in bed.  and\\ndr. bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor mamma is better,\\nand regina has been got away somewhere.\\\"\\n\\narcher had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at\\nthe deserted thoroughfare.  it was evident that he had been summoned\\nrather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any\\nspecific aid that he could render.  mr. lovell mingott had been\\ntelegraphed for, and messages were being despatched by hand to the\\nmembers of the family living in new york; and meanwhile there was\\nnothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of\\nbeaufort's dishonour and of his wife's unjustifiable action.\\n\\nmrs. lovell mingott, who had been in another room writing notes,\\npresently reappeared, and added her voice to the discussion.  in their\\nday, the elder ladies agreed, the wife of a man who had done anything\\ndisgraceful in business had only one idea: to efface herself, to\\ndisappear with him.  \\\"there was the case of poor grandmamma spicer;\\nyour great-grandmother, may.  of course,\\\" mrs. welland hastened to add,\\n\\\"your great-grandfather's money difficulties were private--losses at\\ncards, or signing a note for somebody--i never quite knew, because\\nmamma would never speak of it.  but she was brought up in the country\\nbecause her mother had to leave new york after the disgrace, whatever\\nit was: they lived up the hudson alone, winter and summer, till mamma\\nwas sixteen.  it would never have occurred to grandmamma spicer to ask\\nthe family to 'countenance' her, as i understand regina calls it;\\nthough a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining\\nhundreds of innocent people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes, it would be more becoming in regina to hide her own countenance\\nthan to talk about other people's,\\\" mrs. lovell mingott agreed.  \\\"i\\nunderstand that the emerald necklace she wore at the opera last friday\\nhad been sent on approval from ball and black's in the afternoon.  i\\nwonder if they'll ever get it back?\\\"\\n\\narcher listened unmoved to the relentless chorus.  the idea of absolute\\nfinancial probity as the first law of a gentleman's code was too deeply\\ningrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it.  an\\nadventurer like lemuel struthers might build up the millions of his\\nshoe polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty\\nwas the noblesse oblige of old financial new york.  nor did mrs.\\nbeaufort's fate greatly move archer.  he felt, no doubt, more sorry for\\nher than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie\\nbetween husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be\\nindissoluble in misfortune.  as mr. letterblair had said, a wife's\\nplace was at her husband's side when he was in trouble; but society's\\nplace was not at his side, and mrs. beaufort's cool assumption that it\\nwas seemed almost to make her his accomplice.  the mere idea of a\\nwoman's appealing to her family to screen her husband's business\\ndishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the family,\\nas an institution, could not do.\\n\\nthe mulatto maid called mrs. lovell mingott into the hall, and the\\nlatter came back in a moment with a frowning brow.\\n\\n\\\"she wants me to telegraph for ellen olenska.  i had written to ellen,\\nof course, and to medora; but now it seems that's not enough.  i'm to\\ntelegraph to her immediately, and to tell her that she's to come alone.\\\"\\n\\nthe announcement was received in silence.  mrs. welland sighed\\nresignedly, and may rose from her seat and went to gather up some\\nnewspapers that had been scattered on the floor.\\n\\n\\\"i suppose it must be done,\\\" mrs. lovell mingott continued, as if\\nhoping to be contradicted; and may turned back toward the middle of the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\\"of course it must be done,\\\" she said.  \\\"granny knows what she wants,\\nand we must carry out all her wishes.  shall i write the telegram for\\nyou, auntie?  if it goes at once ellen can probably catch tomorrow\\nmorning's train.\\\"  she pronounced the syllables of the name with a\\npeculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells.\\n\\n\\\"well, it can't go at once.  jasper and the pantry-boy are both out\\nwith notes and telegrams.\\\"\\n\\nmay turned to her husband with a smile.  \\\"but here's newland, ready to\\ndo anything.  will you take the telegram, newland?  there'll be just\\ntime before luncheon.\\\"\\n\\narcher rose with a murmur of readiness, and she seated herself at old\\ncatherine's rosewood \\\"bonheur du jour,\\\" and wrote out the message in\\nher large immature hand.  when it was written she blotted it neatly and\\nhanded it to archer.\\n\\n\\\"what a pity,\\\" she said, \\\"that you and ellen will cross each other on\\nthe way!--newland,\\\" she added, turning to her mother and aunt, \\\"is\\nobliged to go to washington about a patent law-suit that is coming up\\nbefore the supreme court.  i suppose uncle lovell will be back by\\ntomorrow night, and with granny improving so much it doesn't seem right\\nto ask newland to give up an important engagement for the firm--does\\nit?\\\"\\n\\nshe paused, as if for an answer, and mrs. welland hastily declared:\\n\\\"oh, of course not, darling.  your granny would be the last person to\\nwish it.\\\"  as archer left the room with the telegram, he heard his\\nmother-in-law add, presumably to mrs. lovell mingott:  \\\"but why on\\nearth she should make you telegraph for ellen olenska--\\\" and may's\\nclear voice rejoin:  \\\"perhaps it's to urge on her again that after all\\nher duty is with her husband.\\\"\\n\\nthe outer door closed on archer and he walked hastily away toward the\\ntelegraph office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"ol-ol--howjer spell it, anyhow?\\\" asked the tart young lady to whom\\narcher had pushed his wife's telegram across the brass ledge of the\\nwestern union office.\\n\\n\\\"olenska--o-len-ska,\\\" he repeated, drawing back the message in order to\\nprint out the foreign syllables above may's rambling script.\\n\\n\\\"it's an unlikely name for a new york telegraph office; at least in\\nthis quarter,\\\" an unexpected voice observed; and turning around archer\\nsaw lawrence lefferts at his elbow, pulling an imperturbable moustache\\nand affecting not to glance at the message.\\n\\n\\\"hallo, newland: thought i'd catch you here.  i've just heard of old\\nmrs. mingott's stroke; and as i was on my way to the house i saw you\\nturning down this street and nipped after you.  i suppose you've come\\nfrom there?\\\"\\n\\narcher nodded, and pushed his telegram under the lattice.\\n\\n\\\"very bad, eh?\\\" lefferts continued.  \\\"wiring to the family, i suppose.\\ni gather it is bad, if you're including countess olenska.\\\"\\n\\narcher's lips stiffened; he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into\\nthe long vain handsome face at his side.\\n\\n\\\"why?\\\" he questioned.\\n\\nlefferts, who was known to shrink from discussion, raised his eye-brows\\nwith an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel\\nbehind the lattice.  nothing could be worse \\\"form\\\" the look reminded\\narcher, than any display of temper in a public place.\\n\\narcher had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form; but\\nhis impulse to do lawrence lefferts a physical injury was only\\nmomentary.  the idea of bandying ellen olenska's name with him at such\\na time, and on whatsoever provocation, was unthinkable.  he paid for\\nhis telegram, and the two young men went out together into the street.\\nthere archer, having regained his self-control, went on:  \\\"mrs. mingott\\nis much better: the doctor feels no anxiety whatever\\\"; and lefferts,\\nwith profuse expressions of relief, asked him if he had heard that\\nthere were beastly bad rumours again about beaufort....\\n\\nthat afternoon the announcement of the beaufort failure was in all the\\npapers.  it overshadowed the report of mrs. manson mingott's stroke,\\nand only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the\\ntwo events thought of ascribing old catherine's illness to anything but\\nthe accumulation of flesh and years.\\n\\nthe whole of new york was darkened by the tale of beaufort's dishonour.\\nthere had never, as mr. letterblair said, been a worse case in his\\nmemory, nor, for that matter, in the memory of the far-off letterblair\\nwho had given his name to the firm.  the bank had continued to take in\\nmoney for a whole day after its failure was inevitable; and as many of\\nits clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans, beaufort's\\nduplicity seemed doubly cynical.  if mrs. beaufort had not taken the\\ntone that such misfortunes (the word was her own) were \\\"the test of\\nfriendship,\\\" compassion for her might have tempered the general\\nindignation against her husband.  as it was--and especially after the\\nobject of her nocturnal visit to mrs. manson mingott had become\\nknown--her cynicism was held to exceed his; and she had not the\\nexcuse--nor her detractors the satisfaction--of pleading that she was\\n\\\"a foreigner.\\\"  it was some comfort (to those whose securities were not\\nin jeopardy) to be able to remind themselves that beaufort was; but,\\nafter all, if a dallas of south carolina took his view of the case, and\\nglibly talked of his soon being \\\"on his feet again,\\\" the argument lost\\nits edge, and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence\\nof the indissolubility of marriage.  society must manage to get on\\nwithout the beauforts, and there was an end of it--except indeed for\\nsuch hapless victims of the disaster as medora manson, the poor old\\nmiss lannings, and certain other misguided ladies of good family who,\\nif only they had listened to mr. henry van der luyden ...\\n\\n\\\"the best thing the beauforts can do,\\\" said mrs. archer, summing it up\\nas if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of\\ntreatment, \\\"is to go and live at regina's little place in north\\ncarolina.  beaufort has always kept a racing stable, and he had better\\nbreed trotting horses.  i should say he had all the qualities of a\\nsuccessful horsedealer.\\\"  every one agreed with her, but no one\\ncondescended to enquire what the beauforts really meant to do.\\n\\nthe next day mrs. manson mingott was much better: she recovered her\\nvoice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the\\nbeauforts to her again, and asked--when dr. bencomb appeared--what in\\nthe world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health.\\n\\n\\\"if people of my age will eat chicken-salad in the evening what are\\nthey to expect?\\\" she enquired; and, the doctor having opportunely\\nmodified her dietary, the stroke was transformed into an attack of\\nindigestion.  but in spite of her firm tone old catherine did not\\nwholly recover her former attitude toward life.  the growing remoteness\\nof old age, though it had not diminished her curiosity about her\\nneighbours, had blunted her never very lively compassion for their\\ntroubles; and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the beaufort\\ndisaster out of her mind.  but for the first time she became absorbed\\nin her own symptoms, and began to take a sentimental interest in\\ncertain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been\\ncontemptuously indifferent.\\n\\nmr. welland, in particular, had the privilege of attracting her notice.\\nof her sons-in-law he was the one she had most consistently ignored;\\nand all his wife's efforts to represent him as a man of forceful\\ncharacter and marked intellectual ability (if he had only \\\"chosen\\\") had\\nbeen met with a derisive chuckle.  but his eminence as a valetudinarian\\nnow made him an object of engrossing interest, and mrs. mingott issued\\nan imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his\\ntemperature permitted; for old catherine was now the first to recognise\\nthat one could not be too careful about temperatures.\\n\\ntwenty-four hours after madame olenska's summons a telegram announced\\nthat she would arrive from washington on the evening of the following\\nday.  at the wellands', where the newland archers chanced to be\\nlunching, the question as to who should meet her at jersey city was\\nimmediately raised; and the material difficulties amid which the\\nwelland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost, lent\\nanimation to the debate.  it was agreed that mrs. welland could not\\npossibly go to jersey city because she was to accompany her husband to\\nold catherine's that afternoon, and the brougham could not be spared,\\nsince, if mr. welland were \\\"upset\\\" by seeing his mother-in-law for the\\nfirst time after her attack, he might have to be taken home at a\\nmoment's notice.  the welland sons would of course be \\\"down town,\\\" mr.\\nlovell mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting, and the\\nmingott carriage engaged in meeting him; and one could not ask may, at\\nthe close of a winter afternoon, to go alone across the ferry to jersey\\ncity, even in her own carriage.  nevertheless, it might appear\\ninhospitable--and contrary to old catherine's express wishes--if madame\\nolenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the\\nstation to receive her.  it was just like ellen, mrs. welland's tired\\nvoice implied, to place the family in such a dilemma.  \\\"it's always one\\nthing after another,\\\" the poor lady grieved, in one of her rare revolts\\nagainst fate; \\\"the only thing that makes me think mamma must be less\\nwell than dr. bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have ellen\\ncome at once, however inconvenient it is to meet her.\\\"\\n\\nthe words had been thoughtless, as the utterances of impatience often\\nare; and mr. welland was upon them with a pounce.\\n\\n\\\"augusta,\\\" he said, turning pale and laying down his fork, \\\"have you\\nany other reason for thinking that bencomb is less to be relied on than\\nhe was?  have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than\\nusual in following up my case or your mother's?\\\"\\n\\nit was mrs. welland's turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of\\nher blunder unrolled themselves before her; but she managed to laugh,\\nand take a second helping of scalloped oysters, before she said,\\nstruggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness: \\\"my dear, how\\ncould you imagine such a thing?  i only meant that, after the decided\\nstand mamma took about its being ellen's duty to go back to her\\nhusband, it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden\\nwhim to see her, when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that\\nshe might have asked for.  but we must never forget that mamma, in\\nspite of her wonderful vitality, is a very old woman.\\\"\\n\\nmr. welland's brow remained clouded, and it was evident that his\\nperturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark.  \\\"yes:\\nyour mother's a very old woman; and for all we know bencomb may not be\\nas successful with very old people.  as you say, my dear, it's always\\none thing after another; and in another ten or fifteen years i suppose\\ni shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor.  it's\\nalways better to make such a change before it's absolutely necessary.\\\"\\nand having arrived at this spartan decision mr. welland firmly took up\\nhis fork.\\n\\n\\\"but all the while,\\\" mrs. welland began again, as she rose from the\\nluncheon-table, and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and\\nmalachite known as the back drawing-room, \\\"i don't see how ellen's to\\nbe got here tomorrow evening; and i do like to have things settled for\\nat least twenty-four hours ahead.\\\"\\n\\narcher turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting\\nrepresenting two cardinals carousing, in an octagonal ebony frame set\\nwith medallions of onyx.\\n\\n\\\"shall i fetch her?\\\" he proposed.  \\\"i can easily get away from the\\noffice in time to meet the brougham at the ferry, if may will send it\\nthere.\\\"  his heart was beating excitedly as he spoke.\\n\\nmrs. welland heaved a sigh of gratitude, and may, who had moved away to\\nthe window, turned to shed on him a beam of approval.  \\\"so you see,\\nmamma, everything will be settled twenty-four hours in advance,\\\" she\\nsaid, stooping over to kiss her mother's troubled forehead.\\n\\nmay's brougham awaited her at the door, and she was to drive archer to\\nunion square, where he could pick up a broadway car to carry him to the\\noffice.  as she settled herself in her corner she said:  \\\"i didn't want\\nto worry mamma by raising fresh obstacles; but how can you meet ellen\\ntomorrow, and bring her back to new york, when you're going to\\nwashington?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, i'm not going,\\\" archer answered.\\n\\n\\\"not going?  why, what's happened?\\\"  her voice was as clear as a bell,\\nand full of wifely solicitude.\\n\\n\\\"the case is off--postponed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"postponed?  how odd!  i saw a note this morning from mr. letterblair\\nto mamma saying that he was going to washington tomorrow for the big\\npatent case that he was to argue before the supreme court.  you said it\\nwas a patent case, didn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--that's it: the whole office can't go.  letterblair decided to go\\nthis morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"then it's not postponed?\\\" she continued, with an insistence so unlike\\nher that he felt the blood rising to his face, as if he were blushing\\nfor her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies.\\n\\n\\\"no: but my going is,\\\" he answered, cursing the unnecessary\\nexplanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of\\ngoing to washington, and wondering where he had read that clever liars\\ngive details, but that the cleverest do not.  it did not hurt him half\\nas much to tell may an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she\\nhad not detected him.\\n\\n\\\"i'm not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your\\nfamily,\\\" he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm.  as he spoke he\\nfelt that she was looking at him, and he turned his eyes to hers in\\norder not to appear to be avoiding them.  their glances met for a\\nsecond, and perhaps let them into each other's meanings more deeply\\nthan either cared to go.\\n\\n\\\"yes; it is awfully convenient,\\\" may brightly agreed, \\\"that you should\\nbe able to meet ellen after all; you saw how much mamma appreciated\\nyour offering to do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, i'm delighted to do it.\\\"  the carriage stopped, and as he jumped\\nout she leaned to him and laid her hand on his.  \\\"good-bye, dearest,\\\"\\nshe said, her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone\\non him through tears.\\n\\nhe turned away and hurried across union square, repeating to himself,\\nin a sort of inward chant:  \\\"it's all of two hours from jersey city to\\nold catherine's.  it's all of two hours--and it may be more.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis wife's dark blue brougham (with the wedding varnish still on it)\\nmet archer at the ferry, and conveyed him luxuriously to the\\npennsylvania terminus in jersey city.\\n\\nit was a sombre snowy afternoon, and the gas-lamps were lit in the big\\nreverberating station.  as he paced the platform, waiting for the\\nwashington express, he remembered that there were people who thought\\nthere would one day be a tunnel under the hudson through which the\\ntrains of the pennsylvania railway would run straight into new york.\\nthey were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the\\nbuilding of ships that would cross the atlantic in five days, the\\ninvention of a flying machine, lighting by electricity, telephonic\\ncommunication without wires, and other arabian night marvels.\\n\\n\\\"i don't care which of their visions comes true,\\\" archer mused, \\\"as\\nlong as the tunnel isn't built yet.\\\"  in his senseless school-boy\\nhappiness he pictured madame olenska's descent from the train, his\\ndiscovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless\\nfaces, her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage, their\\nslow approach to the wharf among slipping horses, laden carts,\\nvociferating teamsters, and then the startling quiet of the ferry-boat,\\nwhere they would sit side by side under the snow, in the motionless\\ncarriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to\\nthe other side of the sun.  it was incredible, the number of things he\\nhad to say to her, and in what eloquent order they were forming\\nthemselves on his lips ...\\n\\nthe clanging and groaning of the train came nearer, and it staggered\\nslowly into the station like a prey-laden monster into its lair.\\narcher pushed forward, elbowing through the crowd, and staring blindly\\ninto window after window of the high-hung carriages.  and then,\\nsuddenly, he saw madame olenska's pale and surprised face close at\\nhand, and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what\\nshe looked like.\\n\\nthey reached each other, their hands met, and he drew her arm through\\nhis.  \\\"this way--i have the carriage,\\\" he said.\\n\\nafter that it all happened as he had dreamed.  he helped her into the\\nbrougham with her bags, and had afterward the vague recollection of\\nhaving properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a\\nsummary of the beaufort situation (he was struck by the softness of\\nher:  \\\"poor regina!\\\").  meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out\\nof the coil about the station, and they were crawling down the slippery\\nincline to the wharf, menaced by swaying coal-carts, bewildered horses,\\ndishevelled express-wagons, and an empty hearse--ah, that hearse!  she\\nshut her eyes as it passed, and clutched at archer's hand.\\n\\n\\\"if only it doesn't mean--poor granny!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, no, no--she's much better--she's all right, really.  there--we've\\npassed it!\\\" he exclaimed, as if that made all the difference.  her hand\\nremained in his, and as the carriage lurched across the gang-plank onto\\nthe ferry he bent over, unbuttoned her tight brown glove, and kissed\\nher palm as if he had kissed a relic.  she disengaged herself with a\\nfaint smile, and he said: \\\"you didn't expect me today?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i meant to go to washington to see you.  i'd made all my\\narrangements--i very nearly crossed you in the train.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh--\\\" she exclaimed, as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape.\\n\\n\\\"do you know--i hardly remembered you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"hardly remembered me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i mean: how shall i explain?  i--it's always so.  each time you happen\\nto me all over again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, yes: i know!  i know!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"does it--do i too: to you?\\\" he insisted.\\n\\nshe nodded, looking out of the window.\\n\\n\\\"ellen--ellen--ellen!\\\"\\n\\nshe made no answer, and he sat in silence, watching her profile grow\\nindistinct against the snow-streaked dusk beyond the window.  what had\\nshe been doing in all those four long months, he wondered?  how little\\nthey knew of each other, after all!  the precious moments were slipping\\naway, but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her\\nand could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and\\ntheir proximity, which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their\\nsitting so close to each other, and yet being unable to see each\\nother's faces.\\n\\n\\\"what a pretty carriage!  is it may's?\\\" she asked, suddenly turning her\\nface from the window.\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it was may who sent you to fetch me, then?  how kind of her!\\\"\\n\\nhe made no answer for a moment; then he said explosively:  \\\"your\\nhusband's secretary came to see me the day after we met in boston.\\\"\\n\\nin his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to m. riviere's\\nvisit, and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom.\\nbut her reminder that they were in his wife's carriage provoked him to\\nan impulse of retaliation.  he would see if she liked his reference to\\nriviere any better than he liked hers to may!  as on certain other\\noccasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure,\\nshe betrayed no sign of surprise: and at once he concluded:  \\\"he writes\\nto her, then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"m. riviere went to see you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes: didn't you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no,\\\" she answered simply.\\n\\n\\\"and you're not surprised?\\\"\\n\\nshe hesitated.  \\\"why should i be?  he told me in boston that he knew\\nyou; that he'd met you in england i think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ellen--i must ask you one thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i wanted to ask it after i saw him, but i couldn't put it in a letter.\\nit was riviere who helped you to get away--when you left your husband?\\\"\\n\\nhis heart was beating suffocatingly.  would she meet this question with\\nthe same composure?\\n\\n\\\"yes: i owe him a great debt,\\\" she answered, without the least tremor\\nin her quiet voice.\\n\\nher tone was so natural, so almost indifferent, that archer's turmoil\\nsubsided.  once more she had managed, by her sheer simplicity, to make\\nhim feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging\\nconvention to the winds.\\n\\n\\\"i think you're the most honest woman i ever met!\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"oh, no--but probably one of the least fussy,\\\" she answered, a smile in\\nher voice.\\n\\n\\\"call it what you like: you look at things as they are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--i've had to.  i've had to look at the gorgon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--it hasn't blinded you!  you've seen that she's just an old bogey\\nlike all the others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"she doesn't blind one; but she dries up one's tears.\\\"\\n\\nthe answer checked the pleading on archer's lips: it seemed to come\\nfrom depths of experience beyond his reach.  the slow advance of the\\nferry-boat had ceased, and her bows bumped against the piles of the\\nslip with a violence that made the brougham stagger, and flung archer\\nand madame olenska against each other.  the young man, trembling, felt\\nthe pressure of her shoulder, and passed his arm about her.\\n\\n\\\"if you're not blind, then, you must see that this can't last.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what can't?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"our being together--and not together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no.  you ought not to have come today,\\\" she said in an altered voice;\\nand suddenly she turned, flung her arms about him and pressed her lips\\nto his.  at the same moment the carriage began to move, and a gas-lamp\\nat the head of the slip flashed its light into the window.  she drew\\naway, and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled\\nthrough the congestion of carriages about the ferry-landing.  as they\\ngained the street archer began to speak hurriedly.\\n\\n\\\"don't be afraid of me: you needn't squeeze yourself back into your\\ncorner like that.  a stolen kiss isn't what i want.  look: i'm not even\\ntrying to touch the sleeve of your jacket.  don't suppose that i don't\\nunderstand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us\\ndwindle into an ordinary hole-and-corner love-affair.  i couldn't have\\nspoken like this yesterday, because when we've been apart, and i'm\\nlooking forward to seeing you, every thought is burnt up in a great\\nflame.  but then you come; and you're so much more than i remembered,\\nand what i want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now\\nand then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that i can sit\\nperfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my\\nmind, just quietly trusting to it to come true.\\\"\\n\\nfor a moment she made no reply; then she asked, hardly above a whisper:\\n\\\"what do you mean by trusting to it to come true?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"why--you know it will, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"your vision of you and me together?\\\"  she burst into a sudden hard\\nlaugh.  \\\"you choose your place well to put it to me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"do you mean because we're in my wife's brougham?  shall we get out and\\nwalk, then?  i don't suppose you mind a little snow?\\\"\\n\\nshe laughed again, more gently.  \\\"no; i shan't get out and walk,\\nbecause my business is to get to granny's as quickly as i can.  and\\nyou'll sit beside me, and we'll look, not at visions, but at realities.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i don't know what you mean by realities.  the only reality to me is\\nthis.\\\"\\n\\nshe met the words with a long silence, during which the carriage rolled\\ndown an obscure side-street and then turned into the searching\\nillumination of fifth avenue.\\n\\n\\\"is it your idea, then, that i should live with you as your\\nmistress--since i can't be your wife?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nthe crudeness of the question startled him: the word was one that women\\nof his class fought shy of, even when their talk flitted closest about\\nthe topic.  he noticed that madame olenska pronounced it as if it had a\\nrecognised place in her vocabulary, and he wondered if it had been used\\nfamiliarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from.  her\\nquestion pulled him up with a jerk, and he floundered.\\n\\n\\\"i want--i want somehow to get away with you into a world where words\\nlike that--categories like that--won't exist.  where we shall be simply\\ntwo human beings who love each other, who are the whole of life to each\\nother; and nothing else on earth will matter.\\\"\\n\\nshe drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh.  \\\"oh, my dear--where\\nis that country?  have you ever been there?\\\" she asked; and as he\\nremained sullenly dumb she went on:  \\\"i know so many who've tried to\\nfind it; and, believe me, they all got out by mistake at wayside\\nstations: at places like boulogne, or pisa, or monte carlo--and it\\nwasn't at all different from the old world they'd left, but only rather\\nsmaller and dingier and more promiscuous.\\\"\\n\\nhe had never heard her speak in such a tone, and he remembered the\\nphrase she had used a little while before.\\n\\n\\\"yes, the gorgon has dried your tears,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"well, she opened my eyes too; it's a delusion to say that she blinds\\npeople.  what she does is just the contrary--she fastens their eyelids\\nopen, so that they're never again in the blessed darkness.  isn't there\\na chinese torture like that?  there ought to be.  ah, believe me, it's\\na miserable little country!\\\"\\n\\nthe carriage had crossed forty-second street: may's sturdy\\nbrougham-horse was carrying them northward as if he had been a kentucky\\ntrotter.  archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words.\\n\\n\\\"then what, exactly, is your plan for us?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"for us?  but there's no us in that sense!  we're near each other only\\nif we stay far from each other.  then we can be ourselves.  otherwise\\nwe're only newland archer, the husband of ellen olenska's cousin, and\\nellen olenska, the cousin of newland archer's wife, trying to be happy\\nbehind the backs of the people who trust them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, i'm beyond that,\\\" he groaned.\\n\\n\\\"no, you're not!  you've never been beyond.  and i have,\\\" she said, in\\na strange voice, \\\"and i know what it looks like there.\\\"\\n\\nhe sat silent, dazed with inarticulate pain.  then he groped in the\\ndarkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to\\nthe coachman.  he remembered that may rang twice when she wished to\\nstop.  he pressed the bell, and the carriage drew up beside the\\ncurbstone.\\n\\n\\\"why are we stopping?  this is not granny's,\\\" madame olenska exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"no: i shall get out here,\\\" he stammered, opening the door and jumping\\nto the pavement.  by the light of a street-lamp he saw her startled\\nface, and the instinctive motion she made to detain him.  he closed the\\ndoor, and leaned for a moment in the window.\\n\\n\\\"you're right: i ought not to have come today,\\\" he said, lowering his\\nvoice so that the coachman should not hear.  she bent forward, and\\nseemed about to speak; but he had already called out the order to drive\\non, and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner.  the\\nsnow was over, and a tingling wind had sprung up, that lashed his face\\nas he stood gazing.  suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his\\nlashes, and perceived that he had been crying, and that the wind had\\nfrozen his tears.\\n\\nhe thrust his hands in his pockets, and walked at a sharp pace down\\nfifth avenue to his own house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat evening when archer came down before dinner he found the\\ndrawing-room empty.\\n\\nhe and may were dining alone, all the family engagements having been\\npostponed since mrs. manson mingott's illness; and as may was the more\\npunctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him.  he\\nknew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving\\nabout in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.\\n\\nhe had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means\\nof tying his thoughts fast to reality.  sometimes he felt as if he had\\nfound the clue to his father-in-law's absorption in trifles; perhaps\\neven mr. welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had\\nconjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.\\n\\nwhen may appeared he thought she looked tired.  she had put on the\\nlow-necked and tightly-laced dinner-dress which the mingott ceremonial\\nexacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair\\ninto its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan\\nand almost faded.  but she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and\\nher eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.\\n\\n\\\"what became of you, dear?\\\" she asked.  \\\"i was waiting at granny's, and\\nellen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you\\nhad to rush off on business.  there's nothing wrong?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"only some letters i'd forgotten, and wanted to get off before dinner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--\\\" she said; and a moment afterward:  \\\"i'm sorry you didn't come to\\ngranny's--unless the letters were urgent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"they were,\\\" he rejoined, surprised at her insistence.  \\\"besides, i\\ndon't see why i should have gone to your grandmother's.  i didn't know\\nyou were there.\\\"\\n\\nshe turned and moved to the looking-glass above the mantel-piece.  as\\nshe stood there, lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped\\nfrom its place in her intricate hair, archer was struck by something\\nlanguid and inelastic in her attitude, and wondered if the deadly\\nmonotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also.  then he\\nremembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called\\nover the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother's so that\\nthey might drive home together.  he had called back a cheery \\\"yes!\\\" and\\nthen, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise.  now he was\\nsmitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission\\nshould be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage.  he\\nwas weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the\\ntemperature of passion yet with all its exactions.  if may had spoken\\nout her grievances (he suspected her of many) he might have laughed\\nthem away; but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a\\nspartan smile.\\n\\nto disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was, and she\\nanswered that mrs. mingott was still improving, but had been rather\\ndisturbed by the last news about the beauforts.\\n\\n\\\"what news?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it seems they're going to stay in new york.  i believe he's going into\\nan insurance business, or something.  they're looking about for a small\\nhouse.\\\"\\n\\nthe preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion, and they went\\nin to dinner.  during dinner their talk moved in its usual limited\\ncircle; but archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to madame\\nolenska, nor to old catherine's reception of her.  he was thankful for\\nthe fact, yet felt it to be vaguely ominous.\\n\\nthey went up to the library for coffee, and archer lit a cigar and took\\ndown a volume of michelet.  he had taken to history in the evenings\\nsince may had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she\\nsaw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his\\nown voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he\\nread.  in the days of their engagement she had simply (as he now\\nperceived) echoed what he told her; but since he had ceased to provide\\nher with opinions she had begun to hazard her own, with results\\ndestructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on.\\n\\nseeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket, drew up\\nan arm-chair to the green-shaded student lamp, and uncovered a cushion\\nshe was embroidering for his sofa.  she was not a clever needle-woman;\\nher large capable hands were made for riding, rowing and open-air\\nactivities; but since other wives embroidered cushions for their\\nhusbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion.\\n\\nshe was so placed that archer, by merely raising his eyes, could see\\nher bent above her work-frame, her ruffled elbow-sleeves slipping back\\nfrom her firm round arms, the betrothal sapphire shining on her left\\nhand above her broad gold wedding-ring, and the right hand slowly and\\nlaboriously stabbing the canvas.  as she sat thus, the lamplight full\\non her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he\\nwould always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years\\nto come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a\\nweakness, a cruelty or an emotion.  she had spent her poetry and\\nromance on their short courting: the function was exhausted because the\\nneed was past.  now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother,\\nand mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a mr.\\nwelland.  he laid down his book and stood up impatiently; and at once\\nshe raised her head.\\n\\n\\\"what's the matter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"the room is stifling: i want a little air.\\\"\\n\\nhe had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and\\nforward on a rod, so that they might be closed in the evening, instead\\nof remaining nailed to a gilt cornice, and immovably looped up over\\nlayers of lace, as in the drawing-room; and he pulled them back and\\npushed up the sash, leaning out into the icy night.  the mere fact of\\nnot looking at may, seated beside his table, under his lamp, the fact\\nof seeing other houses, roofs, chimneys, of getting the sense of other\\nlives outside his own, other cities beyond new york, and a whole world\\nbeyond his world, cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe.\\n\\nafter he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard\\nher say:  \\\"newland!  do shut the window.  you'll catch your death.\\\"\\n\\nhe pulled the sash down and turned back.  \\\"catch my death!\\\" he echoed;\\nand he felt like adding:  \\\"but i've caught it already.  i am dead--i've\\nbeen dead for months and months.\\\"\\n\\nand suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion.  what\\nif it were she who was dead!  if she were going to die--to die\\nsoon--and leave him free!  the sensation of standing there, in that\\nwarm familiar room, and looking at her, and wishing her dead, was so\\nstrange, so fascinating and overmastering, that its enormity did not\\nimmediately strike him.  he simply felt that chance had given him a new\\npossibility to which his sick soul might cling.  yes, may might\\ndie--people did: young people, healthy people like herself: she might\\ndie, and set him suddenly free.\\n\\nshe glanced up, and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be\\nsomething strange in his own.\\n\\n\\\"newland!  are you ill?\\\"\\n\\nhe shook his head and turned toward his arm-chair.  she bent over her\\nwork-frame, and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair.  \\\"poor may!\\\"\\nhe said.\\n\\n\\\"poor?  why poor?\\\" she echoed with a strained laugh.\\n\\n\\\"because i shall never be able to open a window without worrying you,\\\"\\nhe rejoined, laughing also.\\n\\nfor a moment she was silent; then she said very low, her head bowed\\nover her work:  \\\"i shall never worry if you're happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, my dear; and i shall never be happy unless i can open the windows!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"in this weather?\\\" she remonstrated; and with a sigh he buried his head\\nin his book.\\n\\nsix or seven days passed.  archer heard nothing from madame olenska,\\nand became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence\\nby any member of the family.  he did not try to see her; to do so while\\nshe was at old catherine's guarded bedside would have been almost\\nimpossible.  in the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift,\\nconscious, somewhere below the surface of his thoughts, of a resolve\\nwhich had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window\\ninto the icy night.  the strength of that resolve made it easy to wait\\nand make no sign.\\n\\nthen one day may told him that mrs. manson mingott had asked to see\\nhim.  there was nothing surprising in the request, for the old lady was\\nsteadily recovering, and she had always openly declared that she\\npreferred archer to any of her other grandsons-in-law.  may gave the\\nmessage with evident pleasure: she was proud of old catherine's\\nappreciation of her husband.\\n\\nthere was a moment's pause, and then archer felt it incumbent on him to\\nsay:  \\\"all right.  shall we go together this afternoon?\\\"\\n\\nhis wife's face brightened, but she instantly answered: \\\"oh, you'd much\\nbetter go alone.  it bores granny to see the same people too often.\\\"\\n\\narcher's heart was beating violently when he rang old mrs. mingott's\\nbell.  he had wanted above all things to go alone, for he felt sure the\\nvisit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the\\ncountess olenska.  he had determined to wait till the chance presented\\nitself naturally; and here it was, and here he was on the doorstep.\\nbehind the door, behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to\\nthe hall, she was surely awaiting him; in another moment he should see\\nher, and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sick-room.\\n\\nhe wanted only to put one question: after that his course would be\\nclear.  what he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to\\nwashington; and that question she could hardly refuse to answer.\\n\\nbut in the yellow sitting-room it was the mulatto maid who waited.  her\\nwhite teeth shining like a keyboard, she pushed back the sliding doors\\nand ushered him into old catherine's presence.\\n\\nthe old woman sat in a vast throne-like arm-chair near her bed.  beside\\nher was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved\\nglobe, over which a green paper shade had been balanced.  there was not\\na book or a newspaper in reach, nor any evidence of feminine\\nemployment: conversation had always been mrs. mingott's sole pursuit,\\nand she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork.\\n\\narcher saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke.  she\\nmerely looked paler, with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of\\nher obesity; and, in the fluted mob-cap tied by a starched bow between\\nher first two chins, and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing\\npurple dressing-gown, she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress\\nof her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the\\ntable.\\n\\nshe held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her\\nhuge lap like pet animals, and called to the maid:  \\\"don't let in any\\none else.  if my daughters call, say i'm asleep.\\\"\\n\\nthe maid disappeared, and the old lady turned to her grandson.\\n\\n\\\"my dear, am i perfectly hideous?\\\" she asked gaily, launching out one\\nhand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom.  \\\"my\\ndaughters tell me it doesn't matter at my age--as if hideousness didn't\\nmatter all the more the harder it gets to conceal!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"my dear, you're handsomer than ever!\\\" archer rejoined in the same\\ntone; and she threw back her head and laughed.\\n\\n\\\"ah, but not as handsome as ellen!\\\" she jerked out, twinkling at him\\nmaliciously; and before he could answer she added:  \\\"was she so awfully\\nhandsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?\\\"\\n\\nhe laughed, and she continued:  \\\"was it because you told her so that\\nshe had to put you out on the way?  in my youth young men didn't desert\\npretty women unless they were made to!\\\"  she gave another chuckle, and\\ninterrupted it to say almost querulously:  \\\"it's a pity she didn't\\nmarry you; i always told her so.  it would have spared me all this\\nworry.  but who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry?\\\"\\n\\narcher wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties; but suddenly\\nshe broke out:  \\\"well, it's settled, anyhow: she's going to stay with\\nme, whatever the rest of the family say!  she hadn't been here five\\nminutes before i'd have gone down on my knees to keep her--if only, for\\nthe last twenty years, i'd been able to see where the floor was!\\\"\\n\\narcher listened in silence, and she went on:  \\\"they'd talked me over,\\nas no doubt you know: persuaded me, lovell, and letterblair, and\\naugusta welland, and all the rest of them, that i must hold out and cut\\noff her allowance, till she was made to see that it was her duty to go\\nback to olenski.  they thought they'd convinced me when the secretary,\\nor whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome\\nproposals i confess they were.  after all, marriage is marriage, and\\nmoney's money--both useful things in their way ... and i didn't know\\nwhat to answer--\\\"  she broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking\\nhad become an effort.  \\\"but the minute i laid eyes on her, i said:\\n'you sweet bird, you!  shut you up in that cage again?  never!'  and\\nnow it's settled that she's to stay here and nurse her granny as long\\nas there's a granny to nurse.  it's not a gay prospect, but she doesn't\\nmind; and of course i've told letterblair that she's to be given her\\nproper allowance.\\\"\\n\\nthe young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind\\nhe hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain.  he had so\\ndefinitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment\\nhe could not readjust his thoughts.  but gradually there stole over him\\nthe delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities\\nmiraculously provided.  if ellen had consented to come and live with\\nher grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the\\nimpossibility of giving him up.  this was her answer to his final\\nappeal of the other day: if she would not take the extreme step he had\\nurged, she had at last yielded to half-measures.  he sank back into the\\nthought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk\\neverything, and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security.\\n\\n\\\"she couldn't have gone back--it was impossible!\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"ah, my dear, i always knew you were on her side; and that's why i sent\\nfor you today, and why i said to your pretty wife, when she proposed to\\ncome with you: 'no, my dear, i'm pining to see newland, and i don't\\nwant anybody to share our transports.'  for you see, my dear--\\\" she\\ndrew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted, and looked\\nhim full in the eyes--\\\"you see, we shall have a fight yet.  the family\\ndon't want her here, and they'll say it's because i've been ill,\\nbecause i'm a weak old woman, that she's persuaded me.  i'm not well\\nenough yet to fight them one by one, and you've got to do it for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i?\\\" he stammered.\\n\\n\\\"you.  why not?\\\" she jerked back at him, her round eyes suddenly as\\nsharp as pen-knives.  her hand fluttered from its chair-arm and lit on\\nhis with a clutch of little pale nails like bird-claws.  \\\"why not?\\\" she\\nsearchingly repeated.\\n\\narcher, under the exposure of her gaze, had recovered his\\nself-possession.\\n\\n\\\"oh, i don't count--i'm too insignificant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, you're letterblair's partner, ain't you?  you've got to get at\\nthem through letterblair.  unless you've got a reason,\\\" she insisted.\\n\\n\\\"oh, my dear, i back you to hold your own against them all without my\\nhelp; but you shall have it if you need it,\\\" he reassured her.\\n\\n\\\"then we're safe!\\\" she sighed; and smiling on him with all her ancient\\ncunning she added, as she settled her head among the cushions:  \\\"i\\nalways knew you'd back us up, because they never quote you when they\\ntalk about its being her duty to go home.\\\"\\n\\nhe winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity, and longed to ask:\\n\\\"and may--do they quote her?\\\"  but he judged it safer to turn the\\nquestion.\\n\\n\\\"and madame olenska?  when am i to see her?\\\" he said.\\n\\nthe old lady chuckled, crumpled her lids, and went through the\\npantomime of archness.  \\\"not today.  one at a time, please.  madame\\nolenska's gone out.\\\"\\n\\nhe flushed with disappointment, and she went on: \\\"she's gone out, my\\nchild: gone in my carriage to see regina beaufort.\\\"\\n\\nshe paused for this announcement to produce its effect.  \\\"that's what\\nshe's reduced me to already.  the day after she got here she put on her\\nbest bonnet, and told me, as cool as a cucumber, that she was going to\\ncall on regina beaufort.  'i don't know her; who is she?' says i.\\n'she's your grand-niece, and a most unhappy woman,' she says.  'she's\\nthe wife of a scoundrel,' i answered.  'well,' she says, 'and so am i,\\nand yet all my family want me to go back to him.'  well, that floored\\nme, and i let her go; and finally one day she said it was raining too\\nhard to go out on foot, and she wanted me to lend her my carriage.\\n'what for?' i asked her; and she said: 'to go and see cousin\\nregina'--cousin!  now, my dear, i looked out of the window, and saw it\\nwasn't raining a drop; but i understood her, and i let her have the\\ncarriage....  after all, regina's a brave woman, and so is she; and\\ni've always liked courage above everything.\\\"\\n\\narcher bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay\\non his.\\n\\n\\\"eh--eh--eh!  whose hand did you think you were kissing, young\\nman--your wife's, i hope?\\\" the old lady snapped out with her mocking\\ncackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him:  \\\"give her her\\ngranny's love; but you'd better not say anything about our talk.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\narcher had been stunned by old catherine's news.  it was only natural\\nthat madame olenska should have hastened from washington in response to\\nher grandmother's summons; but that she should have decided to remain\\nunder her roof--especially now that mrs. mingott had almost regained\\nher health--was less easy to explain.\\n\\narcher was sure that madame olenska's decision had not been influenced\\nby the change in her financial situation.  he knew the exact figure of\\nthe small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation.\\nwithout the addition of her grandmother's allowance it was hardly\\nenough to live on, in any sense known to the mingott vocabulary; and\\nnow that medora manson, who shared her life, had been ruined, such a\\npittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed.  yet archer\\nwas convinced that madame olenska had not accepted her grandmother's\\noffer from interested motives.\\n\\nshe had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of\\npersons used to large fortunes, and indifferent to money; but she could\\ngo without many things which her relations considered indispensable,\\nand mrs. lovell mingott and mrs. welland had often been heard to\\ndeplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of count\\nolenski's establishments should care so little about \\\"how things were\\ndone.\\\"  moreover, as archer knew, several months had passed since her\\nallowance had been cut off; yet in the interval she had made no effort\\nto regain her grandmother's favour.  therefore if she had changed her\\ncourse it must be for a different reason.\\n\\nhe did not have far to seek for that reason.  on the way from the ferry\\nshe had told him that he and she must remain apart; but she had said it\\nwith her head on his breast.  he knew that there was no calculated\\ncoquetry in her words; she was fighting her fate as he had fought his,\\nand clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break\\nfaith with the people who trusted them.  but during the ten days which\\nhad elapsed since her return to new york she had perhaps guessed from\\nhis silence, and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her,\\nthat he was meditating a decisive step, a step from which there was no\\nturning back.  at the thought, a sudden fear of her own weakness might\\nhave seized her, and she might have felt that, after all, it was better\\nto accept the compromise usual in such cases, and follow the line of\\nleast resistance.\\n\\nan hour earlier, when he had rung mrs. mingott's bell, archer had\\nfancied that his path was clear before him.  he had meant to have a\\nword alone with madame olenska, and failing that, to learn from her\\ngrandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to\\nwashington.  in that train he intended to join her, and travel with her\\nto washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go.  his own\\nfancy inclined to japan.  at any rate she would understand at once\\nthat, wherever she went, he was going.  he meant to leave a note for\\nmay that should cut off any other alternative.\\n\\nhe had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to\\ntake it; yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was\\nchanged had been one of relief.  now, however, as he walked home from\\nmrs. mingott's, he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay\\nbefore him.  there was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was\\npresumably to tread; but when he had trodden it before it was as a free\\nman, who was accountable to no one for his actions, and could lend\\nhimself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and\\nprevarications, concealments and compliances, that the part required.\\nthis procedure was called \\\"protecting a woman's honour\\\"; and the best\\nfiction, combined with the after-dinner talk of his elders, had long\\nsince initiated him into every detail of its code.\\n\\nnow he saw the matter in a new light, and his part in it seemed\\nsingularly diminished.  it was, in fact, that which, with a secret\\nfatuity, he had watched mrs. thorley rushworth play toward a fond and\\nunperceiving husband: a smiling, bantering, humouring, watchful and\\nincessant lie.  a lie by day, a lie by night, a lie in every touch and\\nevery look; a lie in every caress and every quarrel; a lie in every\\nword and in every silence.\\n\\nit was easier, and less dastardly on the whole, for a wife to play such\\na part toward her husband.  a woman's standard of truthfulness was\\ntacitly held to be lower: she was the subject creature, and versed in\\nthe arts of the enslaved.  then she could always plead moods and\\nnerves, and the right not to be held too strictly to account; and even\\nin the most strait-laced societies the laugh was always against the\\nhusband.\\n\\nbut in archer's little world no one laughed at a wife deceived, and a\\ncertain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their\\nphilandering after marriage.  in the rotation of crops there was a\\nrecognised season for wild oats; but they were not to be sown more than\\nonce.\\n\\narcher had always shared this view: in his heart he thought lefferts\\ndespicable.  but to love ellen olenska was not to become a man like\\nlefferts: for the first time archer found himself face to face with the\\ndread argument of the individual case.  ellen olenska was like no other\\nwoman, he was like no other man: their situation, therefore, resembled\\nno one else's, and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of\\ntheir own judgment.\\n\\nyes, but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep; and\\nthere were may, and habit, and honour, and all the old decencies that\\nhe and his people had always believed in ...\\n\\nat his corner he hesitated, and then walked on down fifth avenue.\\n\\nahead of him, in the winter night, loomed a big unlit house.  as he\\ndrew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights, its\\nsteps awninged and carpeted, and carriages waiting in double line to\\ndraw up at the curbstone.  it was in the conservatory that stretched\\nits dead-black bulk down the side street that he had taken his first\\nkiss from may; it was under the myriad candles of the ball-room that he\\nhad seen her appear, tall and silver-shining as a young diana.\\n\\nnow the house was as dark as the grave, except for a faint flare of gas\\nin the basement, and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had\\nnot been lowered.  as archer reached the corner he saw that the\\ncarriage standing at the door was mrs. manson mingott's.  what an\\nopportunity for sillerton jackson, if he should chance to pass!  archer\\nhad been greatly moved by old catherine's account of madame olenska's\\nattitude toward mrs. beaufort; it made the righteous reprobation of new\\nyork seem like a passing by on the other side.  but he knew well enough\\nwhat construction the clubs and drawing-rooms would put on ellen\\nolenska's visits to her cousin.\\n\\nhe paused and looked up at the lighted window.  no doubt the two women\\nwere sitting together in that room: beaufort had probably sought\\nconsolation elsewhere.  there were even rumours that he had left new\\nyork with fanny ring; but mrs. beaufort's attitude made the report seem\\nimprobable.\\n\\narcher had the nocturnal perspective of fifth avenue almost to himself.\\nat that hour most people were indoors, dressing for dinner; and he was\\nsecretly glad that ellen's exit was likely to be unobserved.  as the\\nthought passed through his mind the door opened, and she came out.\\nbehind her was a faint light, such as might have been carried down the\\nstairs to show her the way.  she turned to say a word to some one; then\\nthe door closed, and she came down the steps.\\n\\n\\\"ellen,\\\" he said in a low voice, as she reached the pavement.\\n\\nshe stopped with a slight start, and just then he saw two young men of\\nfashionable cut approaching.  there was a familiar air about their\\novercoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their\\nwhite ties; and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be\\ndining out so early.  then he remembered that the reggie chiverses,\\nwhose house was a few doors above, were taking a large party that\\nevening to see adelaide neilson in romeo and juliet, and guessed that\\nthe two were of the number.  they passed under a lamp, and he\\nrecognised lawrence lefferts and a young chivers.\\n\\na mean desire not to have madame olenska seen at the beauforts' door\\nvanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand.\\n\\n\\\"i shall see you now--we shall be together,\\\" he broke out, hardly\\nknowing what he said.\\n\\n\\\"ah,\\\" she answered, \\\"granny has told you?\\\"\\n\\nwhile he watched her he was aware that lefferts and chivers, on\\nreaching the farther side of the street corner, had discreetly struck\\naway across fifth avenue.  it was the kind of masculine solidarity that\\nhe himself often practised; now he sickened at their connivance.  did\\nshe really imagine that he and she could live like this?  and if not,\\nwhat else did she imagine?\\n\\n\\\"tomorrow i must see you--somewhere where we can be alone,\\\" he said, in\\na voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears.\\n\\nshe wavered, and moved toward the carriage.\\n\\n\\\"but i shall be at granny's--for the present that is,\\\" she added, as if\\nconscious that her change of plans required some explanation.\\n\\n\\\"somewhere where we can be alone,\\\" he insisted.\\n\\nshe gave a faint laugh that grated on him.\\n\\n\\\"in new york?  but there are no churches ... no monuments.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"there's the art museum--in the park,\\\" he explained, as she looked\\npuzzled.  \\\"at half-past two.  i shall be at the door ...\\\"\\n\\nshe turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage.\\nas it drove off she leaned forward, and he thought she waved her hand\\nin the obscurity.  he stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory\\nfeelings.  it seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman\\nhe loved but to another, a woman he was indebted to for pleasures\\nalready wearied of: it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this\\nhackneyed vocabulary.\\n\\n\\\"she'll come!\\\" he said to himself, almost contemptuously.\\n\\navoiding the popular \\\"wolfe collection,\\\" whose anecdotic canvases\\nfilled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of cast-iron\\nand encaustic tiles known as the metropolitan museum, they had wandered\\ndown a passage to the room where the \\\"cesnola antiquities\\\" mouldered in\\nunvisited loneliness.\\n\\nthey had this melancholy retreat to themselves, and seated on the divan\\nenclosing the central steam-radiator, they were staring silently at the\\nglass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered\\nfragments of ilium.\\n\\n\\\"it's odd,\\\" madame olenska said, \\\"i never came here before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, well--.  some day, i suppose, it will be a great museum.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes,\\\" she assented absently.\\n\\nshe stood up and wandered across the room.  archer, remaining seated,\\nwatched the light movements of her figure, so girlish even under its\\nheavy furs, the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap, and the way\\na dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the\\near.  his mind, as always when they first met, was wholly absorbed in\\nthe delicious details that made her herself and no other.  presently he\\nrose and approached the case before which she stood.  its glass shelves\\nwere crowded with small broken objects--hardly recognisable domestic\\nutensils, ornaments and personal trifles--made of glass, of clay, of\\ndiscoloured bronze and other time-blurred substances.\\n\\n\\\"it seems cruel,\\\" she said, \\\"that after a while nothing matters ... any\\nmore than these little things, that used to be necessary and important\\nto forgotten people, and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying\\nglass and labelled:  'use unknown.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes; but meanwhile--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, meanwhile--\\\"\\n\\nas she stood there, in her long sealskin coat, her hands thrust in a\\nsmall round muff, her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the\\ntip of her nose, and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring\\nwith her quickly-taken breath, it seemed incredible that this pure\\nharmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change.\\n\\n\\\"meanwhile everything matters--that concerns you,\\\" he said.\\n\\nshe looked at him thoughtfully, and turned back to the divan.  he sat\\ndown beside her and waited; but suddenly he heard a step echoing far\\noff down the empty rooms, and felt the pressure of the minutes.\\n\\n\\\"what is it you wanted to tell me?\\\" she asked, as if she had received\\nthe same warning.\\n\\n\\\"what i wanted to tell you?\\\" he rejoined.  \\\"why, that i believe you\\ncame to new york because you were afraid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"afraid?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"of my coming to washington.\\\"\\n\\nshe looked down at her muff, and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily.\\n\\n\\\"well--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well--yes,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"you were afraid?  you knew--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes: i knew ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, then?\\\" he insisted.\\n\\n\\\"well, then: this is better, isn't it?\\\" she returned with a long\\nquestioning sigh.\\n\\n\\\"better--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"we shall hurt others less.  isn't it, after all, what you always\\nwanted?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"to have you here, you mean--in reach and yet out of reach?  to meet\\nyou in this way, on the sly?  it's the very reverse of what i want.  i\\ntold you the other day what i wanted.\\\"\\n\\nshe hesitated.  \\\"and you still think this--worse?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"a thousand times!\\\"  he paused.  \\\"it would be easy to lie to you; but\\nthe truth is i think it detestable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, so do i!\\\" she cried with a deep breath of relief.\\n\\nhe sprang up impatiently.  \\\"well, then--it's my turn to ask: what is\\nit, in god's name, that you think better?\\\"\\n\\nshe hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her\\nmuff.  the step drew nearer, and a guardian in a braided cap walked\\nlistlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis.\\nthey fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them, and\\nwhen the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and\\nsarcophagi archer spoke again.\\n\\n\\\"what do you think better?\\\"\\n\\ninstead of answering she murmured:  \\\"i promised granny to stay with her\\nbecause it seemed to me that here i should be safer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"from me?\\\"\\n\\nshe bent her head slightly, without looking at him.\\n\\n\\\"safer from loving me?\\\"\\n\\nher profile did not stir, but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and\\nhang in a mesh of her veil.\\n\\n\\\"safer from doing irreparable harm.  don't let us be like all the\\nothers!\\\" she protested.\\n\\n\\\"what others?  i don't profess to be different from my kind.  i'm\\nconsumed by the same wants and the same longings.\\\"\\n\\nshe glanced at him with a kind of terror, and he saw a faint colour\\nsteal into her cheeks.\\n\\n\\\"shall i--once come to you; and then go home?\\\" she suddenly hazarded in\\na low clear voice.\\n\\nthe blood rushed to the young man's forehead.  \\\"dearest!\\\" he said,\\nwithout moving.  it seemed as if he held his heart in his hands, like a\\nfull cup that the least motion might overbrim.\\n\\nthen her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded.  \\\"go home?\\nwhat do you mean by going home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"home to my husband.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and you expect me to say yes to that?\\\"\\n\\nshe raised her troubled eyes to his.  \\\"what else is there?  i can't\\nstay here and lie to the people who've been good to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"but that's the very reason why i ask you to come away!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"and destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?\\\"\\n\\narcher sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate\\ndespair.  it would have been easy to say:  \\\"yes, come; come once.\\\"  he\\nknew the power she would put in his hands if she consented; there would\\nbe no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband.\\n\\nbut something silenced the word on his lips.  a sort of passionate\\nhonesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her\\ninto that familiar trap.  \\\"if i were to let her come,\\\" he said to\\nhimself, \\\"i should have to let her go again.\\\"  and that was not to be\\nimagined.\\n\\nbut he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek, and wavered.\\n\\n\\\"after all,\\\" he began again, \\\"we have lives of our own....  there's no\\nuse attempting the impossible.  you're so unprejudiced about some\\nthings, so used, as you say, to looking at the gorgon, that i don't\\nknow why you're afraid to face our case, and see it as it really\\nis--unless you think the sacrifice is not worth making.\\\"\\n\\nshe stood up also, her lips tightening under a rapid frown.\\n\\n\\\"call it that, then--i must go,\\\" she said, drawing her little watch\\nfrom her bosom.\\n\\nshe turned away, and he followed and caught her by the wrist.  \\\"well,\\nthen: come to me once,\\\" he said, his head turning suddenly at the\\nthought of losing her; and for a second or two they looked at each\\nother almost like enemies.\\n\\n\\\"when?\\\" he insisted.  \\\"tomorrow?\\\"\\n\\nshe hesitated.  \\\"the day after.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"dearest--!\\\" he said again.\\n\\nshe had disengaged her wrist; but for a moment they continued to hold\\neach other's eyes, and he saw that her face, which had grown very pale,\\nwas flooded with a deep inner radiance.  his heart beat with awe: he\\nfelt that he had never before beheld love visible.\\n\\n\\\"oh, i shall be late--good-bye.  no, don't come any farther than this,\\\"\\nshe cried, walking hurriedly away down the long room, as if the\\nreflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her.  when she reached\\nthe door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell.\\n\\narcher walked home alone.  darkness was falling when he let himself\\ninto his house, and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall\\nas if he viewed them from the other side of the grave.\\n\\nthe parlour-maid, hearing his step, ran up the stairs to light the gas\\non the upper landing.\\n\\n\\\"is mrs. archer in?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no, sir; mrs. archer went out in the carriage after luncheon, and\\nhasn't come back.\\\"\\n\\nwith a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in\\nhis armchair.  the parlour-maid followed, bringing the student lamp and\\nshaking some coals onto the dying fire.  when she left he continued to\\nsit motionless, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his clasped hands,\\nhis eyes fixed on the red grate.\\n\\nhe sat there without conscious thoughts, without sense of the lapse of\\ntime, in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather\\nthan quicken it.  \\\"this was what had to be, then ... this was what had\\nto be,\\\" he kept repeating to himself, as if he hung in the clutch of\\ndoom.  what he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a\\nmortal chill in his rapture.\\n\\nthe door opened and may came in.\\n\\n\\\"i'm dreadfully late--you weren't worried, were you?\\\" she asked, laying\\nher hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses.\\n\\nhe looked up astonished.  \\\"is it late?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"after seven.  i believe you've been asleep!\\\"  she laughed, and drawing\\nout her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa.  she looked paler\\nthan usual, but sparkling with an unwonted animation.\\n\\n\\\"i went to see granny, and just as i was going away ellen came in from\\na walk; so i stayed and had a long talk with her.  it was ages since\\nwe'd had a real talk....\\\" she had dropped into her usual armchair,\\nfacing his, and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair.  he\\nfancied she expected him to speak.\\n\\n\\\"a really good talk,\\\" she went on, smiling with what seemed to archer\\nan unnatural vividness.  \\\"she was so dear--just like the old ellen.\\ni'm afraid i haven't been fair to her lately.  i've sometimes thought--\\\"\\n\\narcher stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece, out of the radius\\nof the lamp.\\n\\n\\\"yes, you've thought--?\\\" he echoed as she paused.\\n\\n\\\"well, perhaps i haven't judged her fairly.  she's so different--at\\nleast on the surface.  she takes up such odd people--she seems to like\\nto make herself conspicuous.  i suppose it's the life she's led in that\\nfast european society; no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her.  but i\\ndon't want to judge her unfairly.\\\"\\n\\nshe paused again, a little breathless with the unwonted length of her\\nspeech, and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her\\ncheeks.\\n\\narcher, as he looked at her, was reminded of the glow which had\\nsuffused her face in the mission garden at st. augustine.  he became\\naware of the same obscure effort in her, the same reaching out toward\\nsomething beyond the usual range of her vision.\\n\\n\\\"she hates ellen,\\\" he thought, \\\"and she's trying to overcome the\\nfeeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it.\\\"\\n\\nthe thought moved him, and for a moment he was on the point of breaking\\nthe silence between them, and throwing himself on her mercy.\\n\\n\\\"you understand, don't you,\\\" she went on, \\\"why the family have\\nsometimes been annoyed?  we all did what we could for her at first; but\\nshe never seemed to understand.  and now this idea of going to see mrs.\\nbeaufort, of going there in granny's carriage!  i'm afraid she's quite\\nalienated the van der luydens ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah,\\\" said archer with an impatient laugh.  the open door had closed\\nbetween them again.\\n\\n\\\"it's time to dress; we're dining out, aren't we?\\\" he asked, moving\\nfrom the fire.\\n\\nshe rose also, but lingered near the hearth.  as he walked past her she\\nmoved forward impulsively, as though to detain him: their eyes met, and\\nhe saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her\\nto drive to jersey city.\\n\\nshe flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his.\\n\\n\\\"you haven't kissed me today,\\\" she said in a whisper; and he felt her\\ntremble in his arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"at the court of the tuileries,\\\" said mr. sillerton jackson with his\\nreminiscent smile, \\\"such things were pretty openly tolerated.\\\"\\n\\nthe scene was the van der luydens' black walnut dining-room in madison\\navenue, and the time the evening after newland archer's visit to the\\nmuseum of art.  mr. and mrs. van der luyden had come to town for a few\\ndays from skuytercliff, whither they had precipitately fled at the\\nannouncement of beaufort's failure.  it had been represented to them\\nthat the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable\\naffair made their presence in town more necessary than ever.  it was\\none of the occasions when, as mrs. archer put it, they \\\"owed it to\\nsociety\\\" to show themselves at the opera, and even to open their own\\ndoors.\\n\\n\\\"it will never do, my dear louisa, to let people like mrs. lemuel\\nstruthers think they can step into regina's shoes.  it is just at such\\ntimes that new people push in and get a footing.  it was owing to the\\nepidemic of chicken-pox in new york the winter mrs. struthers first\\nappeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their\\nwives were in the nursery.  you and dear henry, louisa, must stand in\\nthe breach as you always have.\\\"\\n\\nmr. and mrs. van der luyden could not remain deaf to such a call, and\\nreluctantly but heroically they had come to town, unmuffled the house,\\nand sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception.\\n\\non this particular evening they had invited sillerton jackson, mrs.\\narcher and newland and his wife to go with them to the opera, where\\nfaust was being sung for the first time that winter.  nothing was done\\nwithout ceremony under the van der luyden roof, and though there were\\nbut four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually, so that the\\nproper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the\\ngentlemen settled down to their cigars.\\n\\narcher had not seen his wife since the evening before.  he had left\\nearly for the office, where he had plunged into an accumulation of\\nunimportant business.  in the afternoon one of the senior partners had\\nmade an unexpected call on his time; and he had reached home so late\\nthat may had preceded him to the van der luydens', and sent back the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nnow, across the skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate, she\\nstruck him as pale and languid; but her eyes shone, and she talked with\\nexaggerated animation.\\n\\nthe subject which had called forth mr. sillerton jackson's favourite\\nallusion had been brought up (archer fancied not without intention) by\\ntheir hostess.  the beaufort failure, or rather the beaufort attitude\\nsince the failure, was still a fruitful theme for the drawing-room\\nmoralist; and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned mrs.\\nvan der luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on may archer.\\n\\n\\\"is it possible, dear, that what i hear is true?  i was told your\\ngrandmother mingott's carriage was seen standing at mrs. beaufort's\\ndoor.\\\"  it was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady\\nby her christian name.\\n\\nmay's colour rose, and mrs. archer put in hastily: \\\"if it was, i'm\\nconvinced it was there without mrs. mingott's knowledge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, you think--?\\\"  mrs. van der luyden paused, sighed, and glanced at\\nher husband.\\n\\n\\\"i'm afraid,\\\" mr. van der luyden said, \\\"that madame olenska's kind\\nheart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on mrs. beaufort.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"or her taste for peculiar people,\\\" put in mrs. archer in a dry tone,\\nwhile her eyes dwelt innocently on her son's.\\n\\n\\\"i'm sorry to think it of madame olenska,\\\" said mrs. van der luyden;\\nand mrs. archer murmured: \\\"ah, my dear--and after you'd had her twice\\nat skuytercliff!\\\"\\n\\nit was at this point that mr. jackson seized the chance to place his\\nfavourite allusion.\\n\\n\\\"at the tuileries,\\\" he repeated, seeing the eyes of the company\\nexpectantly turned on him, \\\"the standard was excessively lax in some\\nrespects; and if you'd asked where morny's money came from--!  or who\\npaid the debts of some of the court beauties ...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i hope, dear sillerton,\\\" said mrs. archer, \\\"you are not suggesting\\nthat we should adopt such standards?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i never suggest,\\\" returned mr. jackson imperturbably.  \\\"but madame\\nolenska's foreign bringing-up may make her less particular--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah,\\\" the two elder ladies sighed.\\n\\n\\\"still, to have kept her grandmother's carriage at a defaulter's door!\\\"\\nmr. van der luyden protested; and archer guessed that he was\\nremembering, and resenting, the hampers of carnations he had sent to\\nthe little house in twenty-third street.\\n\\n\\\"of course i've always said that she looks at things quite\\ndifferently,\\\" mrs. archer summed up.\\n\\na flush rose to may's forehead.  she looked across the table at her\\nhusband, and said precipitately:  \\\"i'm sure ellen meant it kindly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"imprudent people are often kind,\\\" said mrs. archer, as if the fact\\nwere scarcely an extenuation; and mrs. van der luyden murmured:  \\\"if\\nonly she had consulted some one--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, that she never did!\\\" mrs. archer rejoined.\\n\\nat this point mr. van der luyden glanced at his wife, who bent her head\\nslightly in the direction of mrs. archer; and the glimmering trains of\\nthe three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down\\nto their cigars.  mr. van der luyden supplied short ones on opera\\nnights; but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his\\ninexorable punctuality.\\n\\narcher, after the first act, had detached himself from the party and\\nmade his way to the back of the club box.  from there he watched, over\\nvarious chivers, mingott and rushworth shoulders, the same scene that\\nhe had looked at, two years previously, on the night of his first\\nmeeting with ellen olenska.  he had half-expected her to appear again\\nin old mrs. mingott's box, but it remained empty; and he sat\\nmotionless, his eyes fastened on it, till suddenly madame nilsson's\\npure soprano broke out into \\\"m'ama, non m'ama ...\\\"\\n\\narcher turned to the stage, where, in the familiar setting of giant\\nroses and pen-wiper pansies, the same large blonde victim was\\nsuccumbing to the same small brown seducer.\\n\\nfrom the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where\\nmay sat between two older ladies, just as, on that former evening, she\\nhad sat between mrs. lovell mingott and her newly-arrived \\\"foreign\\\"\\ncousin.  as on that evening, she was all in white; and archer, who had\\nnot noticed what she wore, recognised the blue-white satin and old lace\\nof her wedding dress.\\n\\nit was the custom, in old new york, for brides to appear in this costly\\ngarment during the first year or two of marriage: his mother, he knew,\\nkept hers in tissue paper in the hope that janey might some day wear\\nit, though poor janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and\\nno bridesmaids would be thought more \\\"appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nit struck archer that may, since their return from europe, had seldom\\nworn her bridal satin, and the surprise of seeing her in it made him\\ncompare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with\\nsuch blissful anticipations two years earlier.\\n\\nthough may's outline was slightly heavier, as her goddesslike build had\\nforetold, her athletic erectness of carriage, and the girlish\\ntransparency of her expression, remained unchanged: but for the slight\\nlanguor that archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the\\nexact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of\\nlilies-of-the-valley on her betrothal evening.  the fact seemed an\\nadditional appeal to his pity: such innocence was as moving as the\\ntrustful clasp of a child.  then he remembered the passionate\\ngenerosity latent under that incurious calm.  he recalled her glance of\\nunderstanding when he had urged that their engagement should be\\nannounced at the beaufort ball; he heard the voice in which she had\\nsaid, in the mission garden:  \\\"i couldn't have my happiness made out of\\na wrong--a wrong to some one else;\\\" and an uncontrollable longing\\nseized him to tell her the truth, to throw himself on her generosity,\\nand ask for the freedom he had once refused.\\n\\nnewland archer was a quiet and self-controlled young man.  conformity\\nto the discipline of a small society had become almost his second\\nnature.  it was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic\\nand conspicuous, anything mr. van der luyden would have deprecated and\\nthe club box condemned as bad form.  but he had become suddenly\\nunconscious of the club box, of mr. van der luyden, of all that had so\\nlong enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit.  he walked along the\\nsemi-circular passage at the back of the house, and opened the door of\\nmrs. van der luyden's box as if it had been a gate into the unknown.\\n\\n\\\"m'ama!\\\" thrilled out the triumphant marguerite; and the occupants of\\nthe box looked up in surprise at archer's entrance.  he had already\\nbroken one of the rules of his world, which forbade the entering of a\\nbox during a solo.\\n\\nslipping between mr. van der luyden and sillerton jackson, he leaned\\nover his wife.\\n\\n\\\"i've got a beastly headache; don't tell any one, but come home, won't\\nyou?\\\" he whispered.\\n\\nmay gave him a glance of comprehension, and he saw her whisper to his\\nmother, who nodded sympathetically; then she murmured an excuse to mrs.\\nvan der luyden, and rose from her seat just as marguerite fell into\\nfaust's arms.  archer, while he helped her on with her opera cloak,\\nnoticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies.\\n\\nas they drove away may laid her hand shyly on his.  \\\"i'm so sorry you\\ndon't feel well.  i'm afraid they've been overworking you again at the\\noffice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no--it's not that: do you mind if i open the window?\\\" he returned\\nconfusedly, letting down the pane on his side.  he sat staring out into\\nthe street, feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful\\ninterrogation, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing\\nhouses.  at their door she caught her skirt in the step of the\\ncarriage, and fell against him.\\n\\n\\\"did you hurt yourself?\\\" he asked, steadying her with his arm.\\n\\n\\\"no; but my poor dress--see how i've torn it!\\\" she exclaimed.  she bent\\nto gather up a mud-stained breadth, and followed him up the steps into\\nthe hall.  the servants had not expected them so early, and there was\\nonly a glimmer of gas on the upper landing.\\n\\narcher mounted the stairs, turned up the light, and put a match to the\\nbrackets on each side of the library mantelpiece.  the curtains were\\ndrawn, and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of\\na familiar face met during an unavowable errand.\\n\\nhe noticed that his wife was very pale, and asked if he should get her\\nsome brandy.\\n\\n\\\"oh, no,\\\" she exclaimed with a momentary flush, as she took off her\\ncloak.  \\\"but hadn't you better go to bed at once?\\\" she added, as he\\nopened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette.\\n\\narcher threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the\\nfire.\\n\\n\\\"no; my head is not as bad as that.\\\"  he paused.  \\\"and there's\\nsomething i want to say; something important--that i must tell you at\\nonce.\\\"\\n\\nshe had dropped into an armchair, and raised her head as he spoke.\\n\\\"yes, dear?\\\" she rejoined, so gently that he wondered at the lack of\\nwonder with which she received this preamble.\\n\\n\\\"may--\\\" he began, standing a few feet from her chair, and looking over\\nat her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable\\nabyss.  the sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike\\nhush, and he repeated:  \\\"there is something i've got to tell you ...\\nabout myself ...\\\"\\n\\nshe sat silent, without a movement or a tremor of her lashes.  she was\\nstill extremely pale, but her face had a curious tranquillity of\\nexpression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source.\\n\\narcher checked the conventional phrases of self-accusal that were\\ncrowding to his lips.  he was determined to put the case baldly,\\nwithout vain recrimination or excuse.\\n\\n\\\"madame olenska--\\\" he said; but at the name his wife raised her hand as\\nif to silence him.  as she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of\\nher wedding-ring.\\n\\n\\\"oh, why should we talk about ellen tonight?\\\" she asked, with a slight\\npout of impatience.\\n\\n\\\"because i ought to have spoken before.\\\"\\n\\nher face remained calm.  \\\"is it really worth while, dear?  i know i've\\nbeen unfair to her at times--perhaps we all have.  you've understood\\nher, no doubt, better than we did: you've always been kind to her.  but\\nwhat does it matter, now it's all over?\\\"\\n\\narcher looked at her blankly.  could it be possible that the sense of\\nunreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself\\nto his wife?\\n\\n\\\"all over--what do you mean?\\\" he asked in an indistinct stammer.\\n\\nmay still looked at him with transparent eyes.  \\\"why--since she's going\\nback to europe so soon; since granny approves and understands, and has\\narranged to make her independent of her husband--\\\"\\n\\nshe broke off, and archer, grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in\\none convulsed hand, and steadying himself against it, made a vain\\neffort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts.\\n\\n\\\"i supposed,\\\" he heard his wife's even voice go on, \\\"that you had been\\nkept at the office this evening about the business arrangements.  it\\nwas settled this morning, i believe.\\\"  she lowered her eyes under his\\nunseeing stare, and another fugitive flush passed over her face.\\n\\nhe understood that his own eyes must be unbearable, and turning away,\\nrested his elbows on the mantel-shelf and covered his face.  something\\ndrummed and clanged furiously in his ears; he could not tell if it were\\nthe blood in his veins, or the tick of the clock on the mantel.\\n\\nmay sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out\\nfive minutes.  a lump of coal fell forward in the grate, and hearing\\nher rise to push it back, archer at length turned and faced her.\\n\\n\\\"it's impossible,\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"impossible--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"how do you know--what you've just told me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i saw ellen yesterday--i told you i'd seen her at granny's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it wasn't then that she told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no; i had a note from her this afternoon.--do you want to see it?\\\"\\n\\nhe could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came\\nback almost immediately.\\n\\n\\\"i thought you knew,\\\" she said simply.\\n\\nshe laid a sheet of paper on the table, and archer put out his hand and\\ntook it up.  the letter contained only a few lines.\\n\\n\\\"may dear, i have at last made granny understand that my visit to her\\ncould be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as\\never.  she sees now that if i return to europe i must live by myself,\\nor rather with poor aunt medora, who is coming with me. i am hurrying\\nback to washington to pack up, and we sail next week.  you must be very\\ngood to granny when i'm gone--as good as you've always been to me.\\nellen.\\n\\n\\\"if any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell\\nthem it would be utterly useless.\\\"\\n\\narcher read the letter over two or three times; then he flung it down\\nand burst out laughing.\\n\\nthe sound of his laugh startled him.  it recalled janey's midnight\\nfright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over\\nmay's telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been\\nadvanced.\\n\\n\\\"why did she write this?\\\" he asked, checking his laugh with a supreme\\neffort.\\n\\nmay met the question with her unshaken candour.  \\\"i suppose because we\\ntalked things over yesterday--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"what things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i told her i was afraid i hadn't been fair to her--hadn't always\\nunderstood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many\\npeople who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to\\ncriticise, and yet didn't always know the circumstances.\\\" she paused.\\n\\\"i knew you'd been the one friend she could always count on; and i\\nwanted her to know that you and i were the same--in all our feelings.\\\"\\n\\nshe hesitated, as if waiting for him to speak, and then added slowly:\\n\\\"she understood my wishing to tell her this.  i think she understands\\neverything.\\\"\\n\\nshe went up to archer, and taking one of his cold hands pressed it\\nquickly against her cheek.\\n\\n\\\"my head aches too; good-night, dear,\\\" she said, and turned to the\\ndoor, her torn and muddy wedding-dress dragging after her across the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was, as mrs. archer smilingly said to mrs. welland, a great event\\nfor a young couple to give their first big dinner.\\n\\nthe newland archers, since they had set up their household, had\\nreceived a good deal of company in an informal way.  archer was fond of\\nhaving three or four friends to dine, and may welcomed them with the\\nbeaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in\\nconjugal affairs.  her husband questioned whether, if left to herself,\\nshe would ever have asked any one to the house; but he had long given\\nup trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which\\ntradition and training had moulded her.  it was expected that well-off\\nyoung couples in new york should do a good deal of informal\\nentertaining, and a welland married to an archer was doubly pledged to\\nthe tradition.\\n\\nbut a big dinner, with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen, with\\nroman punch, roses from henderson's, and menus on gilt-edged cards, was\\na different affair, and not to be lightly undertaken.  as mrs. archer\\nremarked, the roman punch made all the difference; not in itself but by\\nits manifold implications--since it signified either canvas-backs or\\nterrapin, two soups, a hot and a cold sweet, full decolletage with\\nshort sleeves, and guests of a proportionate importance.\\n\\nit was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their\\nfirst invitations in the third person, and their summons was seldom\\nrefused even by the seasoned and sought-after.  still, it was\\nadmittedly a triumph that the van der luydens, at may's request, should\\nhave stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the\\ncountess olenska.\\n\\nthe two mothers-in-law sat in may's drawing-room on the afternoon of\\nthe great day, mrs. archer writing out the menus on tiffany's thickest\\ngilt-edged bristol, while mrs. welland superintended the placing of the\\npalms and standard lamps.\\n\\narcher, arriving late from his office, found them still there.  mrs.\\narcher had turned her attention to the name-cards for the table, and\\nmrs. welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large\\ngilt sofa, so that another \\\"corner\\\" might be created between the piano\\nand the window.\\n\\nmay, they told him, was in the dining-room inspecting the mound of\\njacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table, and\\nthe placing of the maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between\\nthe candelabra.  on the piano stood a large basket of orchids which mr.\\nvan der luyden had had sent from skuytercliff.  everything was, in\\nshort, as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event.\\n\\nmrs. archer ran thoughtfully over the list, checking off each name with\\nher sharp gold pen.\\n\\n\\\"henry van der luyden--louisa--the lovell mingotts--the reggie\\nchiverses--lawrence lefferts and gertrude--(yes, i suppose may was\\nright to have them)--the selfridge merrys, sillerton jackson, van\\nnewland and his wife. (how time passes!  it seems only yesterday that\\nhe was your best man, newland)--and countess olenska--yes, i think\\nthat's all....\\\"\\n\\nmrs. welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately.  \\\"no one can say,\\nnewland, that you and may are not giving ellen a handsome send-off.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah, well,\\\" said mrs. archer, \\\"i understand may's wanting her cousin to\\ntell people abroad that we're not quite barbarians.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i'm sure ellen will appreciate it.  she was to arrive this morning, i\\nbelieve.  it will make a most charming last impression.  the evening\\nbefore sailing is usually so dreary,\\\" mrs. welland cheerfully continued.\\n\\narcher turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him:\\n\\\"do go in and have a peep at the table.  and don't let may tire herself\\ntoo much.\\\"  but he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to\\nhis library.  the room looked at him like an alien countenance composed\\ninto a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly\\n\\\"tidied,\\\" and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and\\ncedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.\\n\\n\\\"ah, well,\\\" he thought, \\\"it's not for long--\\\" and he went on to his\\ndressing-room.\\n\\nten days had passed since madame olenska's departure from new york.\\nduring those ten days archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed\\nby the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper, and sent to his office\\nin a sealed envelope addressed in her hand.  this retort to his last\\nappeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar\\ngame; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning.  she was\\nstill fighting against her fate; but she was going to europe, and she\\nwas not returning to her husband.  nothing, therefore, was to prevent\\nhis following her; and once he had taken the irrevocable step, and had\\nproved to her that it was irrevocable, he believed she would not send\\nhim away.\\n\\nthis confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the\\npresent.  it had kept him from writing to her, or betraying, by any\\nsign or act, his misery and mortification.  it seemed to him that in\\nthe deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands;\\nand he waited.\\n\\nthere had been, nevertheless, moments sufficiently difficult to pass;\\nas when mr. letterblair, the day after madame olenska's departure, had\\nsent for him to go over the details of the trust which mrs. manson\\nmingott wished to create for her granddaughter.  for a couple of hours\\narcher had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the\\nwhile obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some\\nreason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close\\nof the conference would reveal it.\\n\\n\\\"well, the lady can't deny that it's a handsome arrangement,\\\" mr.\\nletterblair had summed up, after mumbling over a summary of the\\nsettlement.  \\\"in fact i'm bound to say she's been treated pretty\\nhandsomely all round.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"all round?\\\" archer echoed with a touch of derision.  \\\"do you refer to\\nher husband's proposal to give her back her own money?\\\"\\n\\nmr. letterblair's bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch.  \\\"my\\ndear sir, the law's the law; and your wife's cousin was married under\\nthe french law.  it's to be presumed she knew what that meant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"even if she did, what happened subsequently--.\\\"  but archer paused.\\nmr. letterblair had laid his pen-handle against his big corrugated\\nnose, and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous\\nelderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that\\nvirtue is not synonymous with ignorance.\\n\\n\\\"my dear sir, i've no wish to extenuate the count's transgressions;\\nbut--but on the other side ... i wouldn't put my hand in the fire ...\\nwell, that there hadn't been tit for tat ... with the young\\nchampion....\\\"  mr. letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded\\npaper toward archer.  \\\"this report, the result of discreet enquiries\\n...\\\"  and then, as archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to\\nrepudiate the suggestion, the lawyer somewhat flatly continued:  \\\"i\\ndon't say it's conclusive, you observe; far from it.  but straws show\\n... and on the whole it's eminently satisfactory for all parties that\\nthis dignified solution has been reached.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, eminently,\\\" archer assented, pushing back the paper.\\n\\na day or two later, on responding to a summons from mrs. manson\\nmingott, his soul had been more deeply tried.\\n\\nhe had found the old lady depressed and querulous.\\n\\n\\\"you know she's deserted me?\\\" she began at once; and without waiting\\nfor his reply:  \\\"oh, don't ask me why!  she gave so many reasons that\\ni've forgotten them all.  my private belief is that she couldn't face\\nthe boredom.  at any rate that's what augusta and my daughters-in-law\\nthink.  and i don't know that i altogether blame her.  olenski's a\\nfinished scoundrel; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer\\nthan it is in fifth avenue.  not that the family would admit that: they\\nthink fifth avenue is heaven with the rue de la paix thrown in.  and\\npoor ellen, of course, has no idea of going back to her husband.  she\\nheld out as firmly as ever against that.  so she's to settle down in\\nparis with that fool medora....  well, paris is paris; and you can keep\\na carriage there on next to nothing.  but she was as gay as a bird, and\\ni shall miss her.\\\" two tears, the parched tears of the old, rolled down\\nher puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom.\\n\\n\\\"all i ask is,\\\" she concluded, \\\"that they shouldn't bother me any more.\\ni must really be allowed to digest my gruel....\\\"  and she twinkled a\\nlittle wistfully at archer.\\n\\nit was that evening, on his return home, that may announced her\\nintention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin.  madame olenska's\\nname had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight\\nto washington; and archer looked at his wife with surprise.\\n\\n\\\"a dinner--why?\\\" he interrogated.\\n\\nher colour rose.  \\\"but you like ellen--i thought you'd be pleased.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it's awfully nice--your putting it in that way.  but i really don't\\nsee--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i mean to do it, newland,\\\" she said, quietly rising and going to her\\ndesk.  \\\"here are the invitations all written.  mother helped me--she\\nagrees that we ought to.\\\"  she paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and\\narcher suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the family.\\n\\n\\\"oh, all right,\\\" he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of\\nguests that she had put in his hand.\\n\\nwhen he entered the drawing-room before dinner may was stooping over\\nthe fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed\\nsetting of immaculate tiles.\\n\\nthe tall lamps were all lit, and mr. van der luyden's orchids had been\\nconspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and\\nknobby silver.  mrs. newland archer's drawing-room was generally\\nthought a great success.  a gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the\\nprimulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed, blocked the access to\\nthe bay window (where the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze\\nreduction of the venus of milo); the sofas and arm-chairs of pale\\nbrocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered\\nwith silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames;\\nand tall rosy-shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the\\npalms.\\n\\n\\\"i don't think ellen has ever seen this room lighted up,\\\" said may,\\nrising flushed from her struggle, and sending about her a glance of\\npardonable pride.  the brass tongs which she had propped against the\\nside of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband's\\nanswer; and before he could restore them mr. and mrs. van der luyden\\nwere announced.\\n\\nthe other guests quickly followed, for it was known that the van der\\nluydens liked to dine punctually.  the room was nearly full, and archer\\nwas engaged in showing to mrs. selfridge merry a small highly-varnished\\nverbeckhoven \\\"study of sheep,\\\" which mr. welland had given may for\\nchristmas, when he found madame olenska at his side.\\n\\nshe was excessively pale, and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser\\nand heavier than ever.  perhaps that, or the fact that she had wound\\nseveral rows of amber beads about her neck, reminded him suddenly of\\nthe little ellen mingott he had danced with at children's parties, when\\nmedora manson had first brought her to new york.\\n\\nthe amber beads were trying to her complexion, or her dress was perhaps\\nunbecoming: her face looked lustreless and almost ugly, and he had\\nnever loved it as he did at that minute.  their hands met, and he\\nthought he heard her say:  \\\"yes, we're sailing tomorrow in the\\nrussia--\\\"; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors, and\\nafter an interval may's voice:  \\\"newland!  dinner's been announced.\\nwon't you please take ellen in?\\\"\\n\\nmadame olenska put her hand on his arm, and he noticed that the hand\\nwas ungloved, and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the\\nevening that he had sat with her in the little twenty-third street\\ndrawing-room.  all the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have\\ntaken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on\\nhis sleeve, and he said to himself: \\\"if it were only to see her hand\\nagain i  should  have  to follow her--.\\\"\\n\\nit was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a \\\"foreign\\nvisitor\\\" that mrs. van der luyden could suffer the diminution of being\\nplaced on her host's left.  the fact of madame olenska's \\\"foreignness\\\"\\ncould hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell\\ntribute; and mrs. van der luyden accepted her displacement with an\\naffability which left no doubt as to her approval.  there were certain\\nthings that had to be done, and if done at all, done handsomely and\\nthoroughly; and one of these, in the old new york code, was the tribal\\nrally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.  there\\nwas nothing on earth that the wellands and mingotts would not have done\\nto proclaim their unalterable affection for the countess olenska now\\nthat her passage for europe was engaged; and archer, at the head of his\\ntable, sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her\\npopularity had been retrieved, grievances against her silenced, her\\npast countenanced, and her present irradiated by the family approval.\\nmrs. van der luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her\\nnearest approach to cordiality, and mr. van der luyden, from his seat\\nat may's right, cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify\\nall the carnations he had sent from skuytercliff.\\n\\narcher, who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd\\nimponderability, as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and\\nceiling, wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the\\nproceedings.  as his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to\\nanother he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon may's\\ncanvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale\\nwoman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy.  and then it came\\nover him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of\\nthem he and madame olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense\\npeculiar to \\\"foreign\\\" vocabularies.  he guessed himself to have been,\\nfor months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and\\npatiently listening ears; he understood that, by means as yet unknown\\nto him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had\\nbeen achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife\\non the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined\\nanything, and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply may\\narcher's natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and\\ncousin.\\n\\nit was the old new york way of taking life \\\"without effusion of blood\\\":\\nthe way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed\\ndecency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more\\nill-bred than \\\"scenes,\\\" except the behaviour of those who gave rise to\\nthem.\\n\\nas these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind archer felt like a\\nprisoner in the centre of an armed camp.  he looked about the table,\\nand guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in\\nwhich, over the asparagus from florida, they were dealing with beaufort\\nand his wife.  \\\"it's to show me,\\\" he thought, \\\"what would happen to\\nme--\\\" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy\\nover direct action, and of silence over rash words, closed in on him\\nlike the doors of the family vault.\\n\\nhe laughed, and met mrs. van der luyden's startled eyes.\\n\\n\\\"you think it laughable?\\\" she said with a pinched smile.  \\\"of course\\npoor regina's idea of remaining in new york has its ridiculous side, i\\nsuppose;\\\" and archer muttered:  \\\"of course.\\\"\\n\\nat this point, he became conscious that madame olenska's other\\nneighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right.\\nat the same moment he saw that may, serenely enthroned between mr. van\\nder luyden and mr. selfridge merry, had cast a quick glance down the\\ntable.  it was evident that the host and the lady on his right could\\nnot sit through the whole meal in silence.  he turned to madame\\nolenska, and her pale smile met him.  \\\"oh, do let's see it through,\\\" it\\nseemed to say.\\n\\n\\\"did you find the journey tiring?\\\" he asked in a voice that surprised\\nhim by its naturalness; and she answered that, on the contrary, she had\\nseldom travelled with fewer discomforts.\\n\\n\\\"except, you know, the dreadful heat in the train,\\\" she added; and he\\nremarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the\\ncountry she was going to.\\n\\n\\\"i never,\\\" he declared with intensity, \\\"was more nearly frozen than\\nonce, in april, in the train between calais and paris.\\\"\\n\\nshe said she did not wonder, but remarked that, after all, one could\\nalways carry an extra rug, and that every form of travel had its\\nhardships; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no\\naccount compared with the blessedness of getting away.  she changed\\ncolour, and he added, his voice suddenly rising in pitch:  \\\"i mean to\\ndo a lot of travelling myself before long.\\\"  a tremor crossed her face,\\nand leaning over to reggie chivers, he cried out:  \\\"i say, reggie, what\\ndo you say to a trip round the world: now, next month, i mean?  i'm\\ngame if you are--\\\" at which mrs. reggie piped up that she could not\\nthink of letting reggie go till after the martha washington ball she\\nwas getting up for the blind asylum in easter week; and her husband\\nplacidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for\\nthe international polo match.\\n\\nbut mr. selfridge merry had caught the phrase \\\"round the world,\\\" and\\nhaving once circled the globe in his steam-yacht, he seized the\\nopportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning\\nthe shallowness of the mediterranean ports.  though, after all, he\\nadded, it didn't matter; for when you'd seen athens and smyrna and\\nconstantinople, what else was there?  and mrs. merry said she could\\nnever be too grateful to dr. bencomb for having made them promise not\\nto go to naples on account of the fever.\\n\\n\\\"but you must have three weeks to do india properly,\\\" her husband\\nconceded, anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous\\nglobe-trotter.\\n\\nand at this point the ladies went up to the drawing-room.\\n\\nin the library, in spite of weightier presences, lawrence lefferts\\npredominated.\\n\\nthe talk, as usual, had veered around to the beauforts, and even mr.\\nvan der luyden and mr. selfridge merry, installed in the honorary\\narm-chairs tacitly reserved for them, paused to listen to the younger\\nman's philippic.\\n\\nnever had lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn christian\\nmanhood and exalt the sanctity of the home.  indignation lent him a\\nscathing eloquence, and it was clear that if others had followed his\\nexample, and acted as he talked, society would never have been weak\\nenough to receive a foreign upstart like beaufort--no, sir, not even if\\nhe'd married a van der luyden or a lanning instead of a dallas.  and\\nwhat chance would there have been, lefferts wrathfully questioned, of\\nhis marrying into such a family as the dallases, if he had not already\\nwormed his way into certain houses, as people like mrs. lemuel\\nstruthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake?  if society chose to\\nopen its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great, though the gain\\nwas doubtful; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure\\norigin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration--and at no\\ndistant date.\\n\\n\\\"if things go on at this pace,\\\" lefferts thundered, looking like a\\nyoung prophet dressed by poole, and who had not yet been stoned, \\\"we\\nshall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses,\\nand marrying beaufort's bastards.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, i say--draw it mild!\\\" reggie chivers and young newland protested,\\nwhile mr. selfridge merry looked genuinely alarmed, and an expression\\nof pain and disgust settled on mr. van der luyden's sensitive face.\\n\\n\\\"has he got any?\\\" cried mr. sillerton jackson, pricking up his ears;\\nand while lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh, the old\\ngentleman twittered into archer's ear:  \\\"queer, those fellows who are\\nalways wanting to set things right.  the people who have the worst\\ncooks are always telling you they're poisoned when they dine out.  but\\ni hear there are pressing reasons for our friend lawrence's\\ndiatribe:--typewriter this time, i understand....\\\"\\n\\nthe talk swept past archer like some senseless river running and\\nrunning because it did not know enough to stop.  he saw, on the faces\\nabout him, expressions of interest, amusement and even mirth.  he\\nlistened to the younger men's laughter, and to the praise of the archer\\nmadeira, which mr. van der luyden and mr. merry were thoughtfully\\ncelebrating.  through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude\\nof friendliness toward himself, as if the guard of the prisoner he felt\\nhimself to be were trying to soften his captivity; and the perception\\nincreased his passionate determination to be free.\\n\\nin the drawing-room, where they presently joined the ladies, he met\\nmay's triumphant eyes, and read in them the conviction that everything\\nhad \\\"gone off\\\" beautifully.  she rose from madame olenska's side, and\\nimmediately mrs. van der luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the\\ngilt sofa where she throned.  mrs. selfridge merry bore across the room\\nto join them, and it became clear to archer that here also a conspiracy\\nof rehabilitation and obliteration was going on.  the silent\\norganisation which held his little world together was determined to put\\nitself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety\\nof madame olenska's conduct, or the completeness of archer's domestic\\nfelicity.  all these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely\\nengaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of,\\nsuspected, or even conceived possible, the least hint to the contrary;\\nand from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation archer once more\\ndisengaged the fact that new york believed him to be madame olenska's\\nlover.  he caught the glitter of victory in his wife's eyes, and for\\nthe first time understood that she shared the belief.  the discovery\\nroused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his\\nefforts to discuss the martha washington ball with mrs. reggie chivers\\nand little mrs. newland; and so the evening swept on, running and\\nrunning like a senseless river that did not know how to stop.\\n\\nat length he saw that madame olenska had risen and was saying good-bye.\\nhe understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember\\nwhat he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single\\nword they had exchanged.\\n\\nshe went up to may, the rest of the company making a circle about her\\nas she advanced.  the two young women clasped hands; then may bent\\nforward and kissed her cousin.\\n\\n\\\"certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two,\\\" archer heard\\nreggie chivers say in an undertone to young mrs. newland; and he\\nremembered beaufort's coarse sneer at may's ineffectual beauty.\\n\\na moment later he was in the hall, putting madame olenska's cloak about\\nher shoulders.\\n\\nthrough all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to\\nsay nothing that might startle or disturb her.  convinced that no power\\ncould now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events\\nshape themselves as they would.  but as he followed madame olenska into\\nthe hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone\\nwith her at the door of her carriage.\\n\\n\\\"is your carriage here?\\\" he asked; and at that moment mrs. van der\\nluyden, who was being majestically inserted into her sables, said\\ngently:  \\\"we are driving dear ellen home.\\\"\\n\\narcher's heart gave a jerk, and madame olenska, clasping her cloak and\\nfan with one hand, held out the other to him.  \\\"good-bye,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"good-bye--but i shall see you soon in paris,\\\" he answered aloud--it\\nseemed to him that he had shouted it.\\n\\n\\\"oh,\\\" she murmured, \\\"if you and may could come--!\\\"\\n\\nmr. van der luyden advanced to give her his arm, and archer turned to\\nmrs. van der luyden.  for a moment, in the billowy darkness inside the\\nbig landau, he caught the dim oval of a face, eyes shining\\nsteadily--and she was gone.\\n\\nas he went up the steps he crossed lawrence lefferts coming down with\\nhis wife.  lefferts caught his host by the sleeve, drawing back to let\\ngertrude pass.\\n\\n\\\"i say, old chap: do you mind just letting it be understood that i'm\\ndining with you at the club tomorrow night?  thanks so much, you old\\nbrick!  good-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"it did go off beautifully, didn't it?\\\" may questioned from the\\nthreshold of the library.\\n\\narcher roused himself with a start.  as soon as the last carriage had\\ndriven away, he had come up to the library and shut himself in, with\\nthe hope that his wife, who still lingered below, would go straight to\\nher room.  but there she stood, pale and drawn, yet radiating the\\nfactitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue.\\n\\n\\\"may i come and talk it over?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"of course, if you like.  but you must be awfully sleepy--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no, i'm not sleepy.  i should like to sit with you a little.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"very well,\\\" he said, pushing her chair near the fire.\\n\\nshe sat down and he resumed his seat; but neither spoke for a long\\ntime.  at length archer began abruptly: \\\"since you're not tired, and\\nwant to talk, there's something i must tell you.  i tried to the other\\nnight--.\\\"\\n\\nshe looked at him quickly.  \\\"yes, dear.  something about yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"about myself.  you say you're not tired: well, i am.  horribly tired\\n...\\\"\\n\\nin an instant she was all tender anxiety.  \\\"oh, i've seen it coming on,\\nnewland!  you've been so wickedly overworked--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"perhaps it's that.  anyhow, i want to make a break--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"a break?  to give up the law?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"to go away, at any rate--at once.  on a long trip, ever so far\\noff--away from everything--\\\"\\n\\nhe paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with\\nthe indifference of a man who longs for a change, and is yet too weary\\nto welcome it.  do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated.\\n\\\"away from everything--\\\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\\"ever so far?  where, for instance?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"oh, i don't know.  india--or japan.\\\"\\n\\nshe stood up, and as he sat with bent head, his chin propped on his\\nhands, he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him.\\n\\n\\\"as far as that?  but i'm afraid you can't, dear ...\\\" she said in an\\nunsteady voice.  \\\"not unless you'll take me with you.\\\"  and then, as he\\nwas silent, she went on, in tones so clear and evenly-pitched that each\\nseparate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain:  \\\"that is,\\nif the doctors will let me go ... but i'm afraid they won't.  for you\\nsee, newland, i've been sure since this morning of something i've been\\nso longing and hoping for--\\\"\\n\\nhe looked up at her with a sick stare, and she sank down, all dew and\\nroses, and hid her face against his knee.\\n\\n\\\"oh, my dear,\\\" he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked\\nher hair.\\n\\nthere was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident\\nlaughter; then may freed herself from his arms and stood up.\\n\\n\\\"you didn't guess--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes--i; no.  that is, of course i hoped--\\\"\\n\\nthey looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then,\\nturning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly:  \\\"have you told any one\\nelse?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"only mamma and your mother.\\\"  she paused, and then added hurriedly,\\nthe blood flushing up to her forehead:  \\\"that is--and ellen.  you know\\ni told you we'd had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to\\nme.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--\\\" said archer, his heart stopping.\\n\\nhe felt that his wife was watching him intently.  \\\"did you mind my\\ntelling her first, newland?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"mind?  why should i?\\\"  he made a last effort to collect himself.  \\\"but\\nthat was a fortnight ago, wasn't it?  i thought you said you weren't\\nsure till today.\\\"\\n\\nher colour burned deeper, but she held his gaze.  \\\"no; i wasn't sure\\nthen--but i told her i was.  and you see i was right!\\\" she exclaimed,\\nher blue eyes wet with victory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnewland archer sat at the writing-table in his library in east\\nthirty-ninth street.\\n\\nhe had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration\\nof the new galleries at the metropolitan museum, and the spectacle of\\nthose great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the\\nthrong of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically\\ncatalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory.\\n\\n\\\"why, this used to be one of the old cesnola rooms,\\\" he heard some one\\nsay; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting\\nalone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure\\nin a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely-fitted vista of\\nthe old museum.\\n\\nthe vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking\\nwith new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the\\nscene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations.\\n\\nit was the room in which most of the real things of his life had\\nhappened.  there his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\\nchild; and there their eldest boy, dallas, too delicate to be taken to\\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the bishop\\nof new york, the ample magnificent irreplaceable bishop, so long the\\npride and ornament of his diocese.  there dallas had first staggered\\nacross the floor shouting \\\"dad,\\\" while may and the nurse laughed behind\\nthe door; there their second child, mary (who was so like her mother),\\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of reggie\\nchivers's many sons; and there archer had kissed her through her\\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\\nto grace church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\\nfoundations the \\\"grace church wedding\\\" remained an unchanged\\ninstitution.\\n\\nit was in the library that he and may had always discussed the future\\nof the children: the studies of dallas and his young brother bill,\\nmary's incurable indifference to \\\"accomplishments,\\\" and passion for\\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward \\\"art\\\" which had\\nfinally landed the restless and curious dallas in the office of a\\nrising new york architect.\\n\\nthe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  if they were not\\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\\nthey were going in for central american archaeology, for architecture\\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\\ngeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\\n\\\"colonial.\\\"  nobody nowadays had \\\"colonial\\\" houses except the\\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\\n\\nbut above all--sometimes archer put it above all--it was in that\\nlibrary that the governor of new york, coming down from albany one\\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\\n\\\"hang the professional politician!  you're the kind of man the country\\nwants, archer.  if the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you\\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"men like you--\\\" how archer had glowed at the phrase!  how eagerly he\\nhad risen up at the call!  it was an echo of ned winsett's old appeal\\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\\nirresistible.\\n\\narcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself were what\\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which theodore\\nroosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\\nfor after a year in the state assembly he had not been re-elected, and\\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\\napathy.  it was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\\nwall.  he had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship\\nto be his strength and pride.\\n\\nhe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call \\\"a good\\ncitizen.\\\"  in new york, for many years past, every new movement,\\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\\nand wanted his name.  people said:  \\\"ask archer\\\" when there was a\\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\\nreorganising the museum of art, founding the grolier club, inaugurating\\nthe new library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  his\\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  he supposed it was all\\na man ought to ask.\\n\\nsomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  but he thought of\\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\\nprize in a lottery.  there were a hundred million tickets in his\\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\\ndecidedly against him.  when he thought of ellen olenska it was\\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\\nhad missed.  that vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\\nfrom thinking of other women.  he had been what was called a faithful\\nhusband; and when may had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\\nhonestly mourned her.  their long years together had shown him that it\\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\\nugly appetites.  looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\\nmourned for it.  after all, there was good in the old ways.\\n\\nhis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by dallas with\\nenglish mezzotints, chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old eastlake\\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\\nfirst photograph of may, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\\n\\nthere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\\nand flapping leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\\nmission garden.  and as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  this hard\\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\\nher incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\\nviews from her as archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  and she had\\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\\nconvinced that, whatever happened, newland would continue to inculcate\\nin dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\\nparents' lives, and that dallas in turn (when newland followed her)\\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little bill.  and of mary she was\\nsure as of her own self.  so, having snatched little bill from the\\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\\nplace in the archer vault in st.  mark's, where mrs. archer already lay\\nsafe from the terrifying \\\"trend\\\" which her daughter-in-law had never\\neven become aware of.\\n\\nopposite may's portrait stood one of her daughter.  mary chivers was as\\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  mary chivers's\\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\\ntwenty-inch waist that may archer's azure sash so easily spanned.  and\\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely\\ngirt as her figure.  mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  there\\nwas good in the new order too.\\n\\nthe telephone clicked, and archer, turning from the photographs,\\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  how far they were from the days\\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been new york's\\nonly means of quick communication!\\n\\n\\\"chicago wants you.\\\"\\n\\nah--it must be a long-distance from dallas, who had been sent to\\nchicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the lakeside palace they\\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  the firm always sent\\ndallas on such errands.\\n\\n\\\"hallo, dad--yes: dallas.  i say--how do you feel about sailing on\\nwednesday?  mauretania: yes, next wednesday as ever is.  our client\\nwants me to look at some italian gardens before we settle anything, and\\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  i've got to be back on the\\nfirst of june--\\\" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--\\\"so we\\nmust look alive.  i say, dad, i want your help: do come.\\\"\\n\\ndallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\\nfire.  the fact would not ordinarily have surprised archer, for\\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\\nelectric lighting and five-day atlantic voyages.  but the laugh did\\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\\nbusy indifferent millions--dallas's laugh should be able to say: \\\"of\\ncourse, whatever happens, i must get back on the first, because fanny\\nbeaufort and i are to be married on the fifth.\\\"\\n\\nthe voice began again:  \\\"think it over?  no, sir: not a minute.  you've\\ngot to say yes now.  why not, i'd like to know?  if you can allege a\\nsingle reason--no; i knew it.  then it's a go, eh?  because i count on\\nyou to ring up the cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better\\nbook a return on a boat from marseilles.  i say, dad; it'll be our last\\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  oh, good!  i knew you would.\\\"\\n\\nchicago rang off, and archer rose and began to pace up and down the\\nroom.\\n\\nit would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\\nright.  they would have lots of other \\\"times\\\" after dallas's marriage,\\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and fanny\\nbeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\\ninterfere with their intimacy.  on the contrary, from what he had seen\\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  still,\\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\\n\\nthere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  may had disliked to move except\\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\\nthirty-ninth street or their comfortable quarters at the wellands' in\\nnewport.  after dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\\nold-fashioned tour through england, switzerland and italy.  their time\\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted france.  archer\\nremembered dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate mont blanc\\ninstead of rheims and chartres.  but mary and bill wanted\\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in dallas's wake\\nthrough the english cathedrals; and may, always fair to her children,\\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\\nartistic proclivities.  she had indeed proposed that her husband should\\ngo to paris for a fortnight, and join them on the italian lakes after\\nthey had \\\"done\\\" switzerland; but archer had declined.  \\\"we'll stick\\ntogether,\\\" he said; and may's face had brightened at his setting such a\\ngood example to dallas.\\n\\nsince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\\nhis continuing in the same routine.  his children had urged him to\\ntravel: mary chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\\nand \\\"see the galleries.\\\"  the very mysteriousness of such a cure made\\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  but archer had found himself\\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\\nnew things.\\n\\nnow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\\nthe worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\\ndoing anything else.  at least that was the view that the men of his\\ngeneration had taken.  the trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\\nscope for the unforeseen.  there are moments when a man's imagination,\\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  archer hung there and\\nwondered....\\n\\nwhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\\nstandards had bent and bound him?  he remembered a sneering prophecy of\\npoor lawrence lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room:  \\\"if\\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying beaufort's\\nbastards.\\\"\\n\\nit was just what archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  even the boy's aunt janey, who still\\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\\nmother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\\nfanny beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\\n\\\"set\\\" from a paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\\nisabey miniature.\\n\\nfanny beaufort, who had appeared in new york at eighteen, after the\\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as madame olenska had won\\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  she was pretty, amusing\\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  nobody was narrow-minded\\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's\\npast and her own origin.  only the older people remembered so obscure\\nan incident in the business life of new york as beaufort's failure, or\\nthe fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the\\nnotorious fanny ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  he was subsequently heard of in\\nconstantinople, then in russia; and a dozen years later american\\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in buenos ayres, where he\\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  he and his wife died there in\\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\\nappeared in new york in charge of may archer's sister-in-law, mrs. jack\\nwelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian.  the\\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with newland archer's\\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when dallas's engagement was\\nannounced.\\n\\nnothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\\nworld had travelled.  people nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\\nand \\\"movements,\\\" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\\nabout their neighbours.  and of what account was anybody's past, in the\\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\\nplane?\\n\\nnewland archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\\nof the paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\\neagerness of youth.\\n\\nit was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\\ntemples.  he wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in\\nthe presence of miss fanny beaufort--and decided that it was not.  \\\"it\\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,\\\" he\\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\\napprove.\\n\\n\\\"the difference is that these young people take it for granted that\\nthey're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\\nit for granted that we shouldn't.  only, i wonder--the thing one's so\\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\\\"\\n\\nit was the day after their arrival in paris, and the spring sunshine\\nheld archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\\nplace vendome.  one of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with dallas, was that, in paris,\\nhe shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled \\\"palaces.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"oh, all right--of course,\\\" dallas good-naturedly agreed.  \\\"i'll take\\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the bristol say--\\\" leaving his\\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\\n\\narcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\\nscene of his return to paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of madame olenska's\\nlife.  sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  now the spectacle\\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\\n\\ndallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  \\\"hullo, father: this\\nis something like, isn't it?\\\"  they stood for a while looking out in\\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  \\\"by the way, i've got a\\nmessage for you: the countess olenska expects us both at half-past\\nfive.\\\"\\n\\nhe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\\nfor florence the next evening.  archer looked at him, and thought he\\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother mingott's\\nmalice.\\n\\n\\\"oh, didn't i tell you?\\\" dallas pursued.  \\\"fanny made me swear to do\\nthree things while i was in paris: get her the score of the last\\ndebussy songs, go to the grand-guignol and see madame olenska.  you\\nknow she was awfully good to fanny when mr. beaufort sent her over from\\nbuenos ayres to the assomption.  fanny hadn't any friends in paris, and\\nmadame olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\\ni believe she was a great friend of the first mrs. beaufort's.  and\\nshe's our cousin, of course.  so i rang her up this morning, before i\\nwent out, and told her you and i were here for two days and wanted to\\nsee her.\\\"\\n\\narcher continued to stare at him.  \\\"you told her i was here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"of course--why not?\\\"  dallas's eye brows went up whimsically.  then,\\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a\\nconfidential pressure.\\n\\n\\\"i say, father: what was she like?\\\"\\n\\narcher felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze.  \\\"come, own\\nup: you and she were great pals, weren't you?  wasn't she most awfully\\nlovely?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"lovely?  i don't know.  she was different.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"ah--there you have it!  that's what it always comes to, doesn't it?\\nwhen she comes, she's different--and one doesn't know why.  it's\\nexactly what i feel about fanny.\\\"\\n\\nhis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  \\\"about fanny?  but, my\\ndear fellow--i should hope so!  only i don't see--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"dash it, dad, don't be prehistoric!  wasn't she--once--your fanny?\\\"\\n\\ndallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  he was the\\nfirst-born of newland and may archer, yet it had never been possible to\\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  \\\"what's the use of\\nmaking mysteries?  it only makes people want to nose 'em out,\\\" he\\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  but archer, meeting his\\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\\n\\n\\\"my fanny?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,\\\"\\ncontinued his surprising son.\\n\\n\\\"i didn't,\\\" echoed archer with a kind of solemnity.\\n\\n\\\"no: you date, you see, dear old boy.  but mother said--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"your mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"yes: the day before she died.  it was when she sent for me alone--you\\nremember?  she said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you\\nmost wanted.\\\"\\n\\narcher received this strange communication in silence.  his eyes\\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\\nwindow.  at length he said in a low voice:  \\\"she never asked me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"no.  i forgot.  you never did ask each other anything, did you?  and\\nyou never told each other anything.  you just sat and watched each\\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  a deaf-and-dumb\\nasylum, in fact!  well, i back your generation for knowing more about\\neach other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\\nour own.--i say, dad,\\\" dallas broke off, \\\"you're not angry with me?  if\\nyou are, let's make it up and go and lunch at henri's.  i've got to\\nrush out to versailles afterward.\\\"\\n\\narcher did not accompany his son to versailles.  he preferred to spend\\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through paris.  he had to deal all\\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\\nlifetime.\\n\\nafter a little while he did not regret dallas's indiscretion.  it\\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  and that it should have been his\\nwife moved him indescribably.  dallas, for all his affectionate\\ninsight, would not have understood that.  to the boy, no doubt, the\\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\\nforces.  but was it really no more?  for a long time archer sat on a\\nbench in the champs elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\\nrolled by....\\n\\na few streets away, a few hours away, ellen olenska waited.  she had\\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  there was nothing\\nnow to keep her and archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\\n\\nhe got up and walked across the place de la concorde and the tuileries\\ngardens to the louvre.  she had once told him that she often went\\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  for an hour\\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\\nbeauty.  after all, his life had been too starved....\\n\\nsuddenly, before an effulgent titian, he found himself saying:  \\\"but\\ni'm only fifty-seven--\\\" and then he turned away.  for such summer\\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\\n\\nhe went back to the hotel, where he and dallas were to meet; and\\ntogether they walked again across the place de la concorde and over the\\nbridge that leads to the chamber of deputies.\\n\\ndallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was\\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of versailles.  he had had but one\\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\\nthe family to switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\\n\\nas archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\\nincreased.  the boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\\nmaster but as an equal.  \\\"that's it: they feel equal to things--they\\nknow their way about,\\\" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\\n\\nsuddenly dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm.  \\\"oh, by\\njove,\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\nthey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\\ninvalides.  the dome of mansart floated ethereally above the budding\\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\\nof the race's glory.\\n\\narcher knew that madame olenska lived in a square near one of the\\navenues radiating from the invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\\nit up.  now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  for\\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  he thought of the\\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\\nfrenchman who had once said to him:  \\\"ah, good conversation--there is\\nnothing like it, is there?\\\"\\n\\narcher had not seen m. riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of madame\\nolenska's existence.  more than half a lifetime divided them, and she\\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\\nunderstand.  during that time he had been living with his youthful\\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\\ncompanionship.  perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\\n\\nthey had crossed the place des invalides, and were walking down one of\\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  it was a quiet quarter, after\\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\\nan idea of the riches paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\\n\\nthe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\\ninto which they had turned.  dallas stopped again, and looked up.\\n\\n\\\"it must be here,\\\" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with\\na movement from which archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood\\ntogether looking up at the house.\\n\\nit was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\\nfront.  on one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\\n\\n\\\"i wonder which floor--?\\\" dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to\\nsay:  \\\"the fifth.  it must be the one with the awnings.\\\"\\n\\narcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\\n\\n\\\"i say, you know, it's nearly six,\\\" his son at length reminded him.\\n\\nthe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\\n\\n\\\"i believe i'll sit there a moment,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"why--aren't you well?\\\" his son exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"oh, perfectly.  but i should like you, please, to go up without me.\\\"\\n\\ndallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  \\\"but, i say, dad: do you\\nmean you won't come up at all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"i don't know,\\\" said archer slowly.\\n\\n\\\"if you don't she won't understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"go, my boy; perhaps i shall follow you.\\\"\\n\\ndallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\\n\\n\\\"but what on earth shall i say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"my dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?\\\" his father\\nrejoined with a smile.\\n\\n\\\"very well.  i shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\\nthe five flights because you don't like lifts.\\\"\\n\\nhis father smiled again.  \\\"say i'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\\\"\\n\\ndallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\\n\\narcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\\nbalcony.  he calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  he pictured dallas\\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\\n\\\"took after him.\\\"\\n\\nthen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  he thought she would be\\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\\non a table.\\n\\n\\\"it's more real to me here than if i went up,\\\" he suddenly heard\\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\\nother.\\n\\nhe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\\nnever turning from the balcony.  at length a light shone through the\\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\\n\\nat that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, newland archer got\\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na note on the text\\n\\nthe age of innocence first appeared in four large installments in the\\npictorial review, from july to

wealthy family, learns from her mother, catherine, that the bulgarian cavalry have won a battle against the serbs. catherine adds that sergius, raina\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9, was at the head of the charge, and was as heroic in life as he appears in the picture raina keeps in her bedroom. louka, their servant, enters and warns catherine and raina that escaped serbs fleeing the battlefield might be in the area, seeking refuge in the houses of bulgarian families. raina is not worried, and chooses to keep her window unlocked. in the night, a man enters the room through the unlocked window and says he will kill raina if she makes a noise. the man is swiss and an escaped soldier, fighting as a mercenary for the serbians.\\n\\nraina is shocked to see that the man is tired and hungry, that he does not glorify battle, and that he is merely happy to have escaped the carnage alive. raina helps him hide behind a curtain just as catherine, louka, and a bulgarian officer enter to search the room for any serbs who might be hiding in the area. raina convinces them that no one is in her room, and they leave. raina gives the man chocolate creams, which she keeps in a box in her room, and is shocked to hear that the man has no ammunition for his pistol, as he normally only keeps candies in his pockets. the man argues that sergius\\u2019s cavalry charge against the serbs was foolish, and succeeded only by sheer luck. the serbs had machine guns but were given the wrong ammunition by accident, and therefore could not mow down sergius and his men. raina agrees to help the man escape later that night, though she rebukes him for making fun of her fianc\\u00e9 sergius. the man sleeps as raina enlists catherine\\u2019s help, and when raina and catherine return, they allow the man to rest since he has not slept for days.\\n\\nthe second act begins in the garden of the same house, though it is now spring of 1886. louka is engaged to the house\\u2019s head male servant, nicola. louka tells nicola that he will never be more than a servant, and that she has higher aspirations. louka tells him she knows many secrets about the petkoff family, and nicola says that he does, too, but would never blackmail his masters. major petkoff, the head of the family, returns from the war. he reports to catherine that sergius will never receive the military promotion sergius craves, because sergius has no command of military strategy. sergius enters and is greeted warmly by the family, and especially by raina, who still considers him a hero. sergius says he has abandoned his commission in the army out of anger that he will never move up in the ranks. sergius and petkoff tell a story they heard about this swiss soldier being hidden by two bulgarian women during the soldier\\u2019s retreat. catherine and raina realize the story is about them, but do not say anything.\\n\\nsergius speaks with louka in private, and begins flirting with her. louka reveals to sergius that raina might not remain faithful to sergius, and sergius is taken aback. they exit. a man named bluntschli enters the family garden and louka brings him to catherine. catherine realizes that he is the man that hid in raina\\u2019s room, the same man that she and raina helped escape. catherine worries that sergius and petkoff, who are conferring over military plans in the library, might encounter the soldier. sergius and petkoff have no idea that the story they heard about a soldier being helped by two bulgarian women involves the petkoffs. bluntschli has come to return major petkoff\\u2019s coat that catherine and raina lent him to escape. raina is so happy to see him that she blurts out, \\u201cthe chocolate cream soldier!\\u201d when she walks in the room, only to recover herself and blame her outburst, implausibly, on nicola. petkoff and sergius, who have in fact already met bluntschli during the war, ask bluntschli to stay and pass the time.\\n\\nin the final act, the various tensions of the play thus far are exposed. louka tells sergius that the man with whom raina is in love is bluntschli. sergius challenges bluntschli to a duel because of this, but bluntschli explains his way out of it. a picture of herself that raina placed in her father\\u2019s cloak for bluntschli to find is exposed, proving that raina has not been entirely truthful to sergius. raina admits that she has had feelings for bluntschli since they first met. major petkoff is aghast. when bluntschli acknowledges that he has loved raina, sergius and louka reveal that they have been having a secret affair at sergius\\u2019 instigation, and nicola releases louka from their engagement. bluntschli, whose father has just died, has come into a great deal of money, so raina\\u2019s parents are glad to marry her off to him and his handsome fortune. raina is revealed to be 23 rather than 17, enabling bluntschli in good conscience to ask for her hand in marriage. bluntschli promises to hire nicola, whom he admires, to run the hotels he has just received as part of his inheritance. sergius accepts louka as his lover in public, thus satisfying louka\\u2019s desire to move up in the social ranks. the play ends with sergius exclaiming, of bluntschli, \\u201cwhat a man!\\u201d\",\n          \"she stoops to conquer; or, the mistakes of a night: a comedy\\\" by oliver goldsmith is a comedic play written during the late 18th century. the plot revolves around a series of misunderstandings and mistaken identities, particularly focusing on the interactions between the characters young marlow, who is shy around respectable women, and miss hardcastle, who finds herself in the midst of a confusing courtship. this comedy of errors also features a variety of humorous and eccentric characters, including the mischievous tony lumpkin, who complicates matters with his pranks. at the start of the play, we are introduced to mr. and mrs. hardcastle, who discuss their son tony and the arrival of a young gentleman, mr. marlow, whom they hope will be a suitable match for their daughter, kate. however, it quickly becomes evident that marlow's shyness with respectable women is a source of comedy as he approaches interactions awkwardly, unable to communicate properly. meanwhile, tony devises a scheme to trick his family and others, setting the stage for a night filled with humorous misunderstandings. as the characters navigate their relationships and the ensuing chaos, the play promises an entertaining exploration of social norms and romantic pursuits in a comedic light.\",\n          \"winner of the 1921 pulitzer prize, the age of innocence is edith wharton\\u2019s masterful portrait of desire and betrayal during the sumptuous golden age

amusing in the attitude of the orthodox criticism toward bernard shaw he so obviously disregards all the canons and unities and other things which every wellbred dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthy of serious criticism orthodox indeed he knows no more about the dramatic art than according to his own story in the man of destiny napoleon at tavazzano knew of the art of war but both men were successes each in his waythe latter won victories and the former gained audiences in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war and the theatre shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have his characters make long speeches at one another apparently thinking that this embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of bombast and rhetoric there never was an author who showed less predilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results he recognized early in his days many things awry in the world and he assumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit it seems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright he began as an essayist but who reads essays nowadayshe then turned novelist with no better success for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he chose to emit he only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men and womenalthough he has created few of the lattercan be most extremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking as a last resort he turned to the stage not that he cared for the dramatic art for no man seems to care less about art for arts sake being in this a perfect foil to his brilliant compatriot and contemporary wilde he cast his theories in dramatic forms merely because no other course except silence or physical revolt was open to him for a long time it seemed as if this resource too was doomed to fail him but finally he has attained a hearing and now attempts at suppression merely serve to advertise their victim it will repay those who seek analogies in literature to compare shaw with cervantes after a life of heroic endeavor disappointment slavery and poverty the author of don quixote gave the world a serious work which caused to be laughed off the worlds stage forever the final vestiges of decadent chivalry the institution had long been outgrown but its vernacular continued to be the speech and to express the thought of the world and among the vulgar as the quaint old novelist puts it just as today the novel intended for the consumption of the unenlightened must deal with peers and millionaires and be dressed in stilted language marvellously he succeeded but in a way he least intended we have not yet after so many years determined whether it is a work to laugh or cry over it is our joyfullest modern book says carlyle while landor thinks that readers who see nothing more than a burlesque in don quixote have but shallow appreciation of the work shaw in like manner comes upon the scene when many of our social usages are outworn he sees the fact announces it and we burst into guffaws the continuous laughter which greets shaws plays arises from a real contrast in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences when pinero or jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a moment that the authors point of view is our own and that the abnormal predicament of his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his audience with shaw this sense of community of feeling is wholly lacking he describes things as he sees them and the house is in a roar who is right if we were really using our own senses and not gazing through the glasses of convention and romance and makebelieve should we see things as shaw does must it not cause shaw to doubt his own or the publics sanity to hear audiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations and yet if they did not come to laugh they would not come at all mockery is the price he must pay for a hearing or has he calculated to a nicety the power of reaction does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of sordidness to disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness to illusion by disillusionment it is impossible to believe that he is unconscious of the humor of his dramatic situations yet he stoically gives no sign he even dares the charge terrible in proportion to its truth which the most serious of us shrinks fromthe lack of a sense of humor men would rather have their integrity impugned in arms and the man the subject which occupies the dramatists attention is that survival of barbaritymilitarismwhich raises its horrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our civilization no more hoary superstition survives than that the donning of a uniform changes the nature of the wearer this notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon the stage acting rationally our conventionalized senses are shocked the only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently been there and of course mr shaw who has no illusions about anything it is hard to speak too highly of candida no equally subtle and incisive study of domestic relations exists in the english drama one has to turn to george merediths the egoist to find such character dissection the central note of the play is that with the true woman weakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than strength which offers protection candida is quite unpoetic as indeed with rare exceptions women are prone to be they have small delight in poetry but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made the husband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness the poet pitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth the hopelessly demoralized manufacturer the conventional and hence emotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be challenged to rival in the man of destiny the object of the dramatist is not so much the destruction as the explanation of the napoleonic tradition which has so powerfully influenced generation after generation for a century however the man may be regarded he was a miracle shaw shows that he achieved his extraordinary career by suspending for himself the pressure of the moral and conventional atmosphere while leaving it operative for others those who study this playextravaganza that it iswill attain a clearer comprehension of napoleon than they can get from all the biographies you never can tell offers an amusing study of the play of social conventions the twins illustrate the disconcerting effects of that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable gloria demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts the idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned crampton the father typifies the common superstition that among the privileges of parenthood are inflexibility tyranny and respect the last entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved the waiter william is the best illustration of the man who knows his place that the stage has seen he is the most pathetic figure of the play one touch of verisimilitude is lacking none of the guests gives him a tip yet he maintains his urbanity as mr shaw has not yet visited america he may be unaware of the improbability of this situation to those who regard literary men merely as purveyors of amusement for people who have not wit enough to entertain themselves ibsen and shaw maeterlinck and gorky must remain enigmas it is so much pleasanter to ignore than to face unpleasant realitiesto take riverside drive and not mulberry street as the exponent of our life and the expression of our civilization these men are the sappers and miners of the advancing army of justice the audience which demands the truth and despises the contemptible conventions that dominate alike our stage and our life is daily growing shaw and men like himif indeed he is not absolutely uniquewill not for the future lack a hearing m arms and the man act i night a ladys bedchamber in bulgaria in a small town near the dragoman pass it is late in november in the year 1885 and through an open window with a little balcony on the left can be seen a peak of the balkans wonderfully white and beautiful in the starlit snow the interior of the room is not like anything to be seen in the east of europe it is half rich bulgarian half cheap viennese the counterpane and hangings of the bed the window curtains the little carpet and all the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are oriental and gorgeous the paper on the walls is occidental and paltry above the head of the bed which stands against a little wall cutting off the right hand corner of the room diagonally is a painted wooden shrine blue and gold with an ivory image of christ and a light hanging before it in a pierced metal ball suspended by three chains on the left further forward is an ottoman the washstand against the wall on the left consists of an enamelled iron basin with a pail beneath it in a painted metal frame and a single towel on the rail at the side a chair near it is austrian bent wood with cane seat the dressing table between the bed and the window is an ordinary pine table covered with a cloth of many colors but with an expensive toilet mirror on it the door is on the right and there is a chest of drawers between the door and the bed this chest of drawers is also covered by a variegated native cloth and on it there is a pile of paper backed novels a box of chocolate creams and a miniature easel on which is a large photograph of an extremely handsome officer whose lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even from the portrait the room is lighted by a candle on the chest of drawers and another on the dressing table with a box of matches beside it the window is hinged doorwise and stands wide open folding back to the left outside a pair of wooden shutters opening outwards also stand open on the balcony a young lady intensely conscious of the romantic beauty of the night and of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part of it is on the balcony gazing at the snowy balkans she is covered by a long mantle of furs worth on a moderate estimate about three times the furniture of her room her reverie is interrupted by her mother catherine petkoff a woman over forty imperiously energetic with magnificent black hair and eyes who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife of a mountain farmer but is determined to be a viennese lady and to that end wears a fashionable tea gown on all occasions catherine entering hastily full of good news rainashe pronounces it raheena with the stress on the ee rainashe goes to the bed expecting to find raina there why whereraina looks into the room heavens child are you out in the night air instead of in your bed youll catch your death louka told me you were asleep raina coming in i sent her away i wanted to be alone the stars are so beautiful what is the matter catherine such news there has been a battle raina her eyes dilating ah she throws the cloak on the ottoman and comes eagerly to catherine in her nightgown a pretty garment but evidently the only one she has on catherine a great battle at slivnitza a victory and it was won by sergius raina with a cry of delight ah rapturously oh mother then with sudden anxiety is father safe catherine of course he sent me the news sergius is the hero of the hour the idol of the regiment raina tell me tell me how was it ecstatically oh mother mother mother raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman and they kiss one another frantically catherine with surging enthusiasm you cant guess how splendid it is a cavalry chargethink of that he defied our russian commandersacted without ordersled a charge on his own responsibilityheaded it himselfwas the first man to sweep through their guns cant you see it raina our gallant splendid bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing thundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched servian dandies like chaff and youyou kept sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him oh if you have a drop of bulgarian blood in your veins you will worship him when he comes back raina what will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole army of heroes but no matter i am so happyso proud she rises and walks about excitedly it proves that all our ideas were real after all catherine indignantly our ideas real what do you mean raina our ideas of what sergius would doour patriotismour heroic ideals oh what faithless little creatures girls arei sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams when i buckled on sergiuss sword he looked so noble it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure and yetand yetquickly promise me youll never tell him catherine dont ask me for promises until i know what i am promising raina well it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading byron and pushkin and because we were so delighted with the opera that season at bucharest real life is so seldom like thatindeed never as far as i knew it then remorsefully only think mother i doubted him i wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle i had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever russian officers catherine a poor figure shame on you the servians have austrian officers who are just as clever as our russians but we have beaten them in every battle for all that raina laughing and sitting down again yes i was only a prosaic little coward oh to think that it was all truethat sergius is just as splendid and noble as he looksthat the world is really a glorious world for women who can see its glory and men who can act its romance what happiness what unspeakable fulfilment ah she throws herself on her knees beside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her they are interrupted by the entry of louka a handsome proud girl in a pretty bulgarian peasants dress with double apron so defiant that her servility to raina is almost insolent she is afraid of catherine but even with her goes as far as she dares she is just now excited like the others but she has no sympathy for rainas raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies of the two before she addresses them louka if you please madam all the windows are to be closed and the shutters made fast they say there may be shooting in the streets raina and catherine rise together alarmed the servians are being chased right back through the pass and they say they may run into the town our cavalry will be after them and our people will be ready for them you may be sure now that they are running away she goes out on the balcony and pulls the outside shutters to then steps back into the room raina i wish our people were not so cruel what glory is there in killing wretched fugitives catherine businesslike her housekeeping instincts aroused i must see that everything is made safe downstairs raina to louka leave the shutters so that i can just close them if i hear any noise catherine authoritatively turning on her way to the door oh no dear you must keep them fastened you would be sure to drop off to sleep and leave them open make them fast louka louka yes madam she fastens them raina dont be anxious about me the moment i hear a shot i shall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my ears well covered catherine quite the wisest thing you can do my love goodnight raina goodnight they kiss one another and rainas emotion comes back for a moment wish me joy of the happiest night of my lifeif only there are no fugitives catherine go to bed dear and dont think of them she goes out louka secretly to raina if you would like the shutters open just give them a push like this she pushes them they open she pulls them to again one of them ought to be bolted at the bottom but the bolts gone raina with dignity reproving her thanks louka but we must do what we are told louka makes a grimace goodnight louka carelessly goodnight she goes out swaggering raina left alone goes to the chest of drawers and adores the portrait there with feelings that are beyond all expression she does not kiss it or press it to her breast or shew it any mark of bodily affection but she takes it in her hands and elevates it like a priestess raina looking up at the picture with worship oh i shall never be unworthy of you any more my heronever never never she replaces it reverently and selects a novel from the little pile of books she turns over the leaves dreamily finds her page turns the book inside out at it and then with a happy sigh gets into bed and prepares to read herself to sleep but before abandoning herself to fiction she raises her eyes once more thinking of the blessed reality and murmurs my hero my hero a distant shot breaks the quiet of the night outside she starts listening and two more shots much nearer follow startling her so that she scrambles out of bed and hastily blows out the candle on the chest of drawers then putting her fingers in her ears she runs to the dressingtable and blows out the light there and hurries back to bed the room is now in darkness nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in the pierced ball before the image and the starlight seen through the slits at the top of the shutters the firing breaks out again there is a startling fusillade quite close at hand whilst it is still echoing the shutters disappear pulled open from without and for an instant the rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the figure of a man in black upon it the shutters close immediately and the room is dark again but the silence is now broken by the sound of panting then there is a scrape and the flame of a match is seen in the middle of the room raina crouching on the bed whos there the match is out instantly whos there who is that a mans voice in the darkness subduedly but threateningly shsh dont call out or youll be shot be good and no harm will happen to you she is heard leaving her bed and making for the door take care theres no use in trying to run away remember if you raise your voice my pistol will go off commandingly strike a light and let me see you do you hear another moment of silence and darkness then she is heard retreating to the dressingtable she lights a candle and the mystery is at an end a man of about 35 in a deplorable plight bespattered with mud and blood and snow his belt and the strap of his revolver case keeping together the torn ruins of the blue coat of a servian artillery officer as far as the candlelight and his unwashed unkempt condition make it possible to judge he is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance with strong neck and shoulders a roundish obstinate looking head covered with short crisp bronze curls clear quick blue eyes and good brows and mouth a hopelessly prosaic nose like that of a strongminded baby trim soldierlike carriage and energetic manner and with all his wits about him in spite of his desperate predicamenteven with a sense of humor of it without however the least intention of trifling with it or throwing away a chance he reckons up what he can guess about rainaher age her social position her character the extent to which she is frightenedat a glance and continues more politely but still most determinedly excuse my disturbing you but you recognise my uniformservian if im caught i shall be killed determinedly do you understand that raina yes man well i dont intend to get killed if i can help it still more determinedly do you understand that he locks the door with a snap raina disdainfully i suppose not she draws herself up superbly and looks him straight in the face saying with emphasis some soldiers i know are afraid of death man with grim goodhumor all of them dear lady all of them believe me it is our duty to live as long as we can and kill as many of the enemy as we can now if you raise an alarm raina cutting him short you will shoot me how do you know that i am afraid to die man cunningly ah but suppose i dont shoot you what will happen then why a lot of your cavalrythe greatest blackguards in your armywill burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig for ill fight like a demon they shant get me into the street to amuse themselves with i know what they are are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress raina suddenly conscious of her nightgown instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her he watches her and adds pitilessly its rather scanty eh she turns to the ottoman he raises his pistol instantly and cries stop she stops where are you going raina with dignified patience only to get my cloak man darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak a good idea no ill keep the cloak and you will take care that nobody comes in and sees you without it this is a better weapon than the pistol he throws the pistol down on the ottoman raina revolted it is not the weapon of a gentleman man its good enough for a man with only you to stand between him and death as they look at one another for a moment raina hardly able to believe that even a servian officer can be so cynically and selfishly unchivalrous they are startled by a sharp fusillade in the street the chill of imminent death hushes the mans voice as he adds do you hear if you are going to bring those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you are raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn suddenly he starts listening there is a step outside someone tries the door and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it raina looks at the man breathless he throws up his head with the gesture of a man who sees that it is all over with him and dropping the manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her flings the cloak to her exclaiming sincerely and kindly no use im done for quick wrap yourself up theyre coming raina catching the cloak eagerly oh thank you she wraps herself up with great relief he draws his sabre and turns to the door waiting louka outside knocking my lady my lady get up quick and open the door raina anxiously what will you do man grimly never mind keep out of the way it will not last long raina impulsively ill help you hide yourself oh hide yourself quick behind the curtain she seizes him by a torn strip of his sleeve and pulls him towards the window man yielding to her there is just half a chance if you keep your head remember nine soldiers out of ten are born fools he hides behind the curtain looking out for a moment to say finally if they find me i promise you a fighta devil of a fight he disappears raina takes off the cloak and throws it across the foot of the bed then with a sleepy disturbed air she opens the door louka enters excitedly louka a man has been seen climbing up the waterpipe to your balconya servian the soldiers want to search for him and they are so wild and drunk and furious my lady says you are to dress at once raina as if annoyed at being disturbed they shall not search here why have they been let in catherine coming in hastily raina darling are you safe have you seen anyone or heard anything raina i heard the shooting surely the soldiers will not dare come in here catherine i have found a russian officer thank heaven he knows sergius speaking through the door to someone outside sir will you come in now my daughter is ready a young russian officer in bulgarian uniform enters sword in hand the officer with soft feline politeness and stiff military carriage good evening gracious lady i am sorry to intrude but there is a fugitive hiding on the balcony will you and the gracious lady your mother please to withdraw whilst we search raina petulantly nonsense sir you can see that there is no one on the balcony she throws the shutters wide open and stands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden pointing to the moonlit balcony a couple of shots are fired right under the window and a bullet shatters the glass opposite raina who winks and gasps but stands her ground whilst catherine screams and the officer rushes to the balcony the officer on the balcony shouting savagely down to the street cease firing there you fools do you hear cease firing damn you he glares down for a moment then turns to raina trying to resume his polite manner could anyone have got in without your knowledge were you asleep raina no i have not been to bed the officer impatiently coming back into the room your neighbours have their heads so full of runaway servians that they see them everywhere politely gracious lady a thousand pardons goodnight military bow which raina returns coldly another to catherine who follows him out raina closes the shutters she turns and sees louka who has been watching the scene curiously raina dont leave my mother louka whilst the soldiers are here louka glances at raina at the ottoman at the curtain then purses her lips secretively laughs to herself and goes out raina follows her to the door shuts it behind her with a slam and locks it violently the man immediately steps out from behind the curtain sheathing his sabre and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way man a narrow shave but a miss is as good as a mile dear young lady your servant until death i wish for your sake i had joined the bulgarian army instead of the servian i am not a native servian raina haughtily no you are one of the austrians who set the servians on to rob us of our national liberty and who officer their army for them we hate them man austrian not i dont hate me dear young lady i am only a swiss fighting merely as a professional soldier i joined servia because it was nearest to me be generous youve beaten us hollow raina have i not been generous man nobleheroic but im not saved yet this particular rush will soon pass through but the pursuit will go on all night by fits and starts i must take my chance to get off during a quiet interval you dont mind my waiting just a minute or two do you raina oh no i am sorry you will have to go into danger again motioning towards ottoman wont you sitshe breaks off with an irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the pistol the man all nerves shies like a frightened horse man irritably dont frighten me like that what is it raina your pistol it was staring that officer in the face all the time what an escape man vexed at being unnecessarily terrified oh is that all raina staring at him rather superciliously conceiving a poorer and poorer opinion of him and feeling proportionately more and more at her ease with him i am sorry i frightened you she takes up the pistol and hands it to him pray take it to protect yourself against me man grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol no use dear young lady theres nothing in it its not loaded he makes a grimace at it and drops it disparagingly into his revolver case raina load it by all means man ive no ammunition what use are cartridges in battle i always carry chocolate instead and i finished the last cake of that yesterday raina outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood chocolate do you stuff your pockets with sweetslike a schoolboyeven in the field man yes isnt it contemptible raina stares at him unable to utter her feelings then she sails away scornfully to the chest of drawers and returns with the box of confectionery in her hand raina allow me i am sorry i have eaten them all except these she offers him the box man ravenously youre an angel he gobbles the comfits creams delicious he looks anxiously to see whether there are any more there are none he accepts the inevitable with pathetic goodhumor and says with grateful emotion bless you dear lady you can always tell an old soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes the young ones carry pistols and cartridges the old ones grub thank you he hands back the box she snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it away this impatient action is so sudden that he shies again ugh dont do things so suddenly gracious lady dont revenge yourself because i frightened you just now raina superbly frighten me do you know sir that though i am only a woman i think i am at heart as brave as you man i should think so you havent been under fire for three days as i have i can stand two days without shewing it much but no man can stand three days im as nervous as a mouse he sits down on the ottoman and takes his head in his hands would you like to see me cry raina quickly no man if you would all you have to do is to scold me just as if i were a little boy and you my nurse if i were in camp now theyd play all sorts of tricks on me raina a little moved im sorry i wont scold you touched by the sympathy in her tone he raises his head and looks gratefully at her she immediately draws back and says stiffly you must excuse me our soldiers are not like that she moves away from the ottoman man oh yes they are there are only two sorts of soldiers old ones and young ones ive served fourteen years half of your fellows never smelt powder before why how is it that youve just beaten us sheer ignorance of the art of war nothing else indignantly i never saw anything so unprofessional raina ironically oh was it unprofessional to beat you man well come is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw it raina eagerly turning to him as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her did you see the great cavalry charge oh tell me about it describe it to me man you never saw a cavalry charge did you raina how could i man ah perhaps notof course well its a funny sight its like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane first one comes then two or three close behind him and then all the rest in a lump raina her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically yes first onethe bravest of the brave man prosaically hm you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse raina why should he pull at his horse man impatient of so stupid a question its running away with him of course do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed then they all come you can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing the old ones come bunched up under the number one guard they know that they are mere projectiles and that its no use trying to fight the wounds are mostly broken knees from the horses cannoning together raina ugh but i dont believe the first man is a coward i believe he is a hero man goodhumoredly thats what youd have said if youd seen the first man in the charge today raina breathless ah i knew it tell metell me about him man he did it like an operatic tenora regular handsome fellow with flashing eyes and lovely moustache shouting a warcry and charging like don quixote at the windmills we nearly burst with laughter at him but when the sergeant ran up as white as a sheet and told us theyd sent us the wrong cartridges and that we couldnt fire a shot for the next ten minutes we laughed at the other side of our mouths i never felt so sick in my life though ive been in one or two very tight places and i hadnt even a revolver cartridgenothing but chocolate wed no bayonetsnothing of course they just cut us to bits and there was don quixote flourishing like a drum major thinking hed done the cleverest thing ever known whereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it of all the fools ever let loose on a field of battle that man must be the very maddest he and his regiment simply committed suicideonly the pistol missed fire thats all raina deeply wounded but steadfastly loyal to her ideals indeed would you know him again if you saw him man shall i ever forget him she again goes to the chest of drawers he watches her with a vague hope that she may have something else for him to eat she takes the portrait from its stand and brings it to him raina that is a photograph of the gentlemanthe patriot and heroto whom i am betrothed man looking at it im really very sorry looking at her was it fair to lead me on he looks at the portrait again yes thats him not a doubt of it he stifles a laugh raina quickly why do you laugh man shamefacedly but still greatly tickled i didnt laugh i assure you at least i didnt mean to but when i think of him charging the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest thingchokes with suppressed laughter raina sternly give me back the portrait sir man with sincere remorse of course certainly im really very sorry she deliberately kisses it and looks him straight in the face before returning to the chest of drawers to replace it he follows her apologizing perhaps im quite wrong you know no doubt i am most likely he had got wind of the cartridge business somehow and knew it was a safe job raina that is to say he was a pretender and a coward you did not dare say that before man with a comic gesture of despair its no use dear lady i cant make you see it from the professional point of view as he turns away to get back to the ottoman the firing begins again in the distance raina sternly as she sees him listening to the shots so much the better for you man turning how raina you are my enemy and you are at my mercy what would i do if i were a professional soldier man ah true dear young lady youre always right i know how good you have been to me to my last hour i shall remember those three chocolate creams it was unsoldierly but it was angelic raina coldly thank you and now i will do a soldierly thing you cannot stay here after what you have just said about my future husband but i will go out on the balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the street she turns to the window man changing countenance down that waterpipe stop wait i cant i darent the very thought of it makes me giddy i came up it fast enough with death behind me but to face it now in cold bloodhe sinks on the ottoman its no use i give up im beaten give the alarm he drops his head in his hands in the deepest dejection raina disarmed by pity come dont be disheartened she stoops over him almost maternally he shakes his head oh you are a very poor soldiera chocolate cream soldier come cheer up it takes less courage to climb down than to face captureremember that man dreamily lulled by her voice no capture only means death and death is sleepoh sleep sleep sleep

pretending to be deeply impressed a major bless me think of that raina you shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was necessary to climb up to the balcony because ours is the only private house

library a roomful of books raina yes we have one the only one in bulgaria man actually a real library i should like to see that raina affectedly i tell you these things to shew you that you are not in

month in vienna man i saw that dear young lady i saw at once that you knew the world raina have you ever seen the opera of ernani man is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet and a soldiers chorus raina contemptuously no man stifling a heavy sigh of weariness then i dont know it raina i thought you might have remembered the great scene where ernani flying from his foes just as you are tonight takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy an old castilian noble the noble refuses to give him up his guest is sacred to him man quickly waking up a little have your people got that notion raina with dignity my mother and i can understand that notion as you call it and if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality you would have been as safe as in your fathers house man quite sure raina turning her back on him in disgust oh it is useless to try and make you understand man dont be angry you see how awkward it would be for me if there was any mistake my father is a very hospitable man he keeps six hotels but i couldnt trust him as far as that what about your father raina he is away at slivnitza fighting for his country i answer for your safety there is my hand in pledge of it will that reassure you she offers him her hand man looking dubiously at his own hand better not touch my hand dear young lady i must have a wash first raina touched that is very nice of you i see that you are a gentleman man puzzled eh raina you must not think i am surprised bulgarians of really good

unsteadily certainlycertainly you may depend on me raina looks doubtfully at him he smiles foolishly she goes reluctantly turning again at the door and almost catching him in the act of yawning she goes out man drowsily sleep sleep sleep sleep sleethe words trail off into a murmur he wakes again with a shock on the point of falling where am i thats what i want to know where am i must keep awake nothing keeps me awake except dangerremember thatintently danger danger danger dan wheres danger must find it he starts of vaguely around the room in search of it what am i looking for sleepdangerdont

blissful expression comes into his face ah with a happy sigh he sinks back at full length lifts his boots into the bed with a final effort and falls fast asleep instantly catherine comes in followed by raina raina looking at the ottoman hes gone i left him here catherine here then he must have climbed down from the raina seeing him oh she points catherine scandalized well she strides to the left side of the bed raina following and standing opposite her on the right hes fast asleep the brute raina anxiously sh catherine shaking him sir shaking him again harder sir vehemently shaking very bard sir raina catching her arm dont mamma the poor dear is worn out let him sleep catherine letting him go and turning amazed to raina the poor dear raina she looks sternly at her daughter the man sleeps profoundly act ii the sixth of march 1886 in the garden of major petkoffs house it is a fine spring morning and the garden looks fresh and pretty beyond the paling the tops of a couple of minarets can be seen shewing that there is a valley there with the little town in it a few miles further the balkan mountains rise and shut in the view within the garden the side of the house is seen on the right with a garden door reached by a little flight of steps on the left the stable yard with its gateway encroaches on the garden there are fruit bushes along the paling and house covered with washing hung out to dry a path runs by the house and rises by two steps at the corner where it turns out of the right along the front in the middle a small table with two bent wood chairs at it is laid for breakfast with turkish coffee pot cups rolls etc but the cups have been used and the bread broken there is a wooden garden seat against the wall on the left louka smoking a cigaret is standing between the table and the house turning her back with angry disdain on a manservant who is lecturing her he is a middleaged man of cool temperament and low but clear and keen intelligence with the complacency of the servant who values himself on his rank in servility and the imperturbability of the accurate calculator who has no illusions he wears a white bulgarian costume jacket with decorated border sash wide knickerbockers and decorated gaiters his head is shaved up to the crown giving him a high japanese forehead his name is nicola nicola be warned in time louka mend your manners i know the mistress she is so grand that she never dreams that any servant could dare to be disrespectful to her but if she once suspects that you are defying her out you go louka i do defy her i will defy her what do i care for her nicola if you quarrel with the family i never can marry you its the same as if you quarrelled with me louka you take her part against me do you nicola sedately i shall always be dependent on the good will of the family when i leave their service and start a shop in sofia their custom will be half my capital their bad word would ruin me louka you have no spirit i should like to see them dare say a word against me nicola pityingly i should have expected more sense from you louka but youre young youre young louka yes and you like me the better for it dont you but i know some family secrets they wouldnt care to have told young as i am let them quarrel with me if they dare nicola with compassionate superiority do you know what they would do if they heard you talk like that louka what could they do nicola discharge you for untruthfulness who would believe any stories you told after that who would give you another situation who in this house would dare be seen speaking to you ever again how long would your father be left on his little farm she impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret and stamps on it child you dont know the power such high people have over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our poverty against them he goes close to her and lowers his voice look at me ten years in their service do you think i know no secrets i know things about the mistress that she wouldnt have the master know for a thousand levas i know things about him that she wouldnt let him hear the last of for six months if i blabbed them to her i know things about raina that would break off her match with sergius if louka turning on him quickly how do you know i never told you nicola opening his eyes cunningly so thats your little secret is it i thought it might be something like that well you take my advice and be respectful and make the mistress feel that no matter what you know or dont know they can depend on you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully thats what they like and thats how youll make most out of them louka with searching scorn you have the soul of a servant nicola nicola complacently yes thats the secret of success in service a loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden door outside on the left is heard male voice outside hollo hollo there nicola louka master back from the war nicola quickly my word for it louka the wars over off with you and get some fresh coffee he runs out into the stable yard louka as she puts the coffee pot and the cups upon the tray and carries it into the house youll never put the soul of a servant into me major petkoff comes from the stable yard followed by nicola he is a cheerful excitable insignificant unpolished man of about 50 naturally unambitious except as to his income and his importance in local society but just now greatly pleased with the military rank which the war has thrust on him as a man of consequence in his town the fever of plucky patriotism which the servian attack roused in all the bulgarians has pulled him through the war but he is obviously glad to be home again petkoff pointing to the table with his whip breakfast out here eh nicola yes sir the mistress and miss raina have just gone in petkoff fitting down and taking a roll go in and say ive come and get me some fresh coffee nicola its coming sir he goes to the house door louka with fresh coffee a clean cup and a brandy bottle on her tray meets him have you told the mistress louka yes shes coming nicola goes into the house louka brings the coffee to the table petkoff well the servians havent run away with you have they louka no sir petkoff thats right have you brought me some cognac louka putting the bottle on the table here sir petkoff thats right he pours some into his coffee catherine who has at this early hour made only a very perfunctory toilet and wears a bulgarian apron over a once brilliant but now half worn out red dressing gown and a colored handkerchief tied over her thick black hair with turkish slippers on her bare feet comes from the house looking astonishingly handsome and stately under all the circumstances louka goes into the house catherine my dear paul what a surprise for us she stoops over the back of his chair to kiss him have they brought you fresh coffee petkoff yes loukas been looking after me the wars over the treaty was signed three days ago at bucharest and the decree for our army to demobilize was issued yesterday catherine springing erect with flashing eyes the war over paul have you let the austrians force you to make peace petkoff submissively my dear they didnt consult me what could _i_ do she sits down and turns away from him but of course we saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one it declares peace catherine outraged peace petkoff appeasing herbut not friendly relations remember that they wanted to put that in but i insisted on its being struck out what more could i do catherine you could have annexed servia and made prince alexander emperor of the balkans thats what i would have done petkoff i dont doubt it in the least my dear but i should have had to subdue the whole austrian empire first and that would have kept me too long away from you i missed you greatly catherine relenting ah stretches her hand affectionately across the table to squeeze his petkoff and how have you been my dear catherine oh my usual sore throats thats all petkoff with conviction that comes from washing your neck every day ive often told you so catherine nonsense paul petkoff over his coffee and cigaret i dont believe in going too far with these modern customs all this washing cant be good for the health its not natural there was an englishman at phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold water every morning when he got up disgusting it all comes from the english their climate makes them so dirty that they have to be perpetually washing themselves look at my father he never had a bath in his life and he lived to be ninetyeight the healthiest man in bulgaria i dont mind a good wash once a week to keep up my position but once a day is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme catherine you are a barbarian at heart still paul i hope you behaved yourself before all those russian officers petkoff i did my best i took care to let them know that we had a library catherine ah but you didnt tell them that we have an electric bell in it i have had one put up petkoff whats an electric bell catherine you touch a button something tinkles in the kitchen and then nicola comes up petkoff why not shout for him catherine civilized people never shout for their servants ive learnt that while you were away petkoff well ill tell you something ive learnt too civilized people dont hang out their washing to dry where visitors can see it so youd better have all that indicating the clothes on the bushes put somewhere else catherine oh thats absurd paul i dont believe really refined people notice such things someone is heard knocking at the stable gates petkoff theres sergius shouting hollo nicola catherine oh dont shout paul it really isnt nice petkoff bosh he shouts louder than before nicola nicola appearing at the house door yes sir petkoff if that is major saranoff bring him round this way he pronounces the name with the stress on the second syllablesarahnoff nicola yes sir he goes into the stable yard petkoff you must talk to him my dear until raina takes him off our hands he bores my life out about our not promoting himover my head mind you catherine he certainly ought to be promoted when he marries raina besides the country should insist on having at least one native general petkoff yes so that he could throw away whole brigades instead of regiments its no use my dear he has not the slightest chance of promotion until we are quite sure that the peace will be a lasting one nicola at the gate announcing major sergius saranoff he goes into the house and returns presently with a third chair which he places at the table he then withdraws major sergius saranoff the original of the portrait in rainas room is a tall romantically handsome man with the physical hardihood the high spirit and the susceptible imagination of an untamed mountaineer chieftain but his remarkable personal distinction is of a characteristically civilized type the ridges of his eyebrows curving with a ramshorn twist round the marked projections at the outer corners his jealously observant eye his nose thin keen and apprehensive in spite of the pugnacious high bridge and large nostril his assertive chin would not be out of place in a paris salon in short the clever imaginative barbarian has an acute critical faculty which has been thrown into intense activity by the arrival of western civilization in the balkans and the result is precisely what the advent of nineteenthcentury thought first produced in england towit byronism by his brooding on the perpetual failure not only of others but of himself to live up to his imaginative ideals his consequent cynical scorn for humanity the jejune credulity as to the absolute validity of his ideals and the unworthiness of the world in disregarding them his wincings and mockeries under the sting of the petty disillusions which every hour spent among men brings to his infallibly quick observation he has acquired the half tragic half ironic air the mysterious moodiness the suggestion of a strange and terrible history that has left him nothing but undying remorse by which childe harold fascinated the grandmothers of his english contemporaries altogether it is clear that here or nowhere is rainas ideal hero catherine is hardly less enthusiastic and much less reserved in shewing her enthusiasm as he enters from the stable gate she rises effusively to greet him petkoff is distinctly less disposed to make a fuss about him petkoff here already sergius glad to see you catherine my dear sergiusshe holds out both her hands sergius kissing them with scrupulous gallantry my dear mother if i may call you so petkoff drily motherinlaw sergius motherinlaw sit down and have some coffee sergius thank you none for me he gets away from the table with a certain distaste for petkoffs enjoyment of it and posts himself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps leading to the house catherine you look superbsplendid the campaign has improved you everybody here is mad about you we were all wild with enthusiasm about that magnificent cavalry charge sergius with grave irony madam it was the cradle and the grave of my military reputation catherine how so sergius i won the battle the wrong way when our worthy russian generals were losing it the right way that upset their plans and wounded their selfesteem two of their colonels got their regiments driven back on the correct principles of scientific warfare two majorgenerals got killed strictly according to military etiquette those two colonels are now majorgenerals and i am still a simple major catherine you shall not remain so sergius the women are on your side and they will see that justice is done you sergius it is too late i have only waited for the peace to send in my resignation petkoff dropping his cup in his amazement your resignation catherine oh you must withdraw it sergius with resolute measured emphasis folding his arms i never withdraw petkoff vexed now who could have supposed you were going to do such a thing sergius with fire everyone that knew me but enough of myself and my affairs how is raina and where is raina raina suddenly coming round the corner of the house and standing at the top of the steps in the path raina is here she makes a charming picture as they all turn to look at her she wears an underdress of pale green silk draped with an overdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold on her head she wears a pretty phrygian cap of gold tinsel sergius with an exclamation of pleasure goes impulsively to meet her she stretches out her hand he drops chivalrously on one knee and kisses it petkoff aside to catherine beaming with parental pride pretty isnt it she always appears at the right moment catherine impatiently yes she listens for it it is an abominable habit sergius leads raina forward with splendid gallantry as if she were a queen when they come to the table she turns to him with a bend of the head he bows and thus they separate he coming to his place and she going behind her fathers chair raina stooping and kissing her father dear father welcome home petkoff patting her cheek my little pet girl he kisses her she goes to the chair left by nicola for sergius and sits down catherine and so youre no longer a soldier sergius sergius i am no longer a soldier soldiering my dear madam is the cowards art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong and keeping out of harms way when you are weak that is the whole secret of successful fighting get your enemy at a disadvantage and never on any account fight him on equal terms eh major petkoff they wouldnt let us make a fair standup fight of it however i suppose soldiering has to be a trade like any other trade sergius precisely but i have no ambition to succeed as a tradesman so i have taken the advice of that bagman of a captain that settled the exchange of prisoners with us at peerot and given it up petkoff what that swiss fellow sergius ive often thought of that exchange since he overreached us about those horses sergius of course he overreached us his father was a hotel and livery stable keeper and he owed his first step to his knowledge of horsedealing with mock enthusiasm ah he was a soldierevery inch a soldier if only i had bought the horses for my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger i should have been a fieldmarshal now catherine a swiss what was he doing in the servian army petkoff a volunteer of coursekeen on picking up his profession chuckling we shouldnt have been able to begin fighting if these foreigners hadnt shewn us how to do it we knew nothing about it and neither did the servians egad thered have been no war without them raina are there many swiss officers in the servian army petkoff noall austrians just as our officers were all russians this was the only swiss i came across ill never trust a swiss again he cheated ushumbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out chargers they werent even eatable sergius we were two children in the hands of that consummate soldier major simply two innocent little children raina what was he like catherine oh raina what a silly question sergius he was like a commercial traveller in uniform bourgeois to his boots petkoff grinning sergius tell catherine that queer story his friend told us about himhow he escaped after slivnitza you rememberabout his being hid by two women sergius with bitter irony oh yes quite a romance he was serving in the very battery i so unprofessionally charged being a thorough soldier he ran away like the rest of them with our cavalry at his heels to escape their attentions he had the good taste to take refuge in the chamber of some patriotic young bulgarian lady the young lady was enchanted by his persuasive commercial travellers manners she very modestly entertained him for an hour or so and then called in her mother lest her conduct should appear unmaidenly the old lady was equally fascinated and the fugitive was sent on his way in the morning disguised in an old coat belonging to the master of the house who was away at the war raina rising with marked stateliness your life in the camp has made you coarse sergius i did not think you would have repeated such a story before me she turns away coldly catherine also rising she is right sergius if such women exist we should be spared the knowledge of them petkoff pooh nonsense what does it matter sergius ashamed no petkoff i was wrong to raina with earnest humility i beg your pardon i have behaved abominably forgive me raina she bows reservedly and you too madam catherine bows graciously and sits down he proceeds solemnly again addressing raina the glimpses i have had of the seamy side of life during the last few months have made me cynical but i should not have brought my cynicism hereleast of all into your presence raina ihere turning to the others he is evidently about to begin a long speech when the major interrupts him petkoff stuff and nonsense sergius thats quite enough fuss about nothing a soldiers daughter should be able to stand up without flinching to a little strong conversation he rises come its time for us to get to business we have to make up our minds how those three regiments are to get back to phillipopolistheres no forage for them on the sofia route he goes towards the house come along sergius is about to follow him when catherine rises and intervenes catherine oh paul cant you spare sergius for a few moments raina has hardly seen him yet perhaps i can help you to settle about the regiments sergius protesting my dear madam impossible you catherine stopping him playfully you stay here my dear sergius theres no hurry i have a word or two to say to paul sergius instantly bows and steps back now dear taking petkoffs arm come and see the electric bell petkoff oh very well very well they go into the house together affectionately sergius left alone with raina looks anxiously at her fearing that she may be still offended she smiles and stretches out her arms to him exit r into house followed by catherine sergius hastening to her but refraining from touching her without express permission am i forgiven raina placing her hands on his shoulder as she looks up at him with admiration and worship my hero my king sergius my queen he kisses her on the forehead with holy awe raina how i have envied you sergius you have been out in the world on the field of battle able to prove yourself there worthy of any woman in the world whilst i have had to sit at home inactivedreaminguselessdoing nothing that could give me the right to call myself worthy of any man sergius dearest all my deeds have been yours you inspired me i have gone through the war like a knight in a tournament with his lady looking on at him raina and you have never been absent from my thoughts for a moment very solemnly sergius i think we two have found the higher love when i think of you i feel that i could never do a base deed or think an ignoble thought sergius my lady and my saint clasping her reverently raina returning his embrace my lord and my g sergius shsh let me be the worshipper dear you little know how unworthy even the best man is of a girls pure passion raina i trust you i love you you will never disappoint me sergius louka is heard singing within the house they quickly release each other hush i cant pretend to talk indifferently before her my heart is too full louka comes from the house with her tray she goes to the table and begins to clear it with her back turned to them i will go and get my hat and then we can go out until lunch time wouldnt you like that sergius be quick if you are away five minutes it will seem five hours raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands he looks after her with emotion for a moment then turns slowly away his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which has just passed the movement shifts his field of vision into the corner of which there now comes the tail of loukas double apron his eye gleams at once he takes a stealthy look at her and begins to twirl his moustache nervously with his left hand akimbo on his hip finally striking the ground with his heels in something of a cavalry swagger he strolls over to the left of the table opposite her and says louka do you know what the higher love is louka astonished no sir sergius very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time louka one feels the need of some relief after it louka innocently perhaps you would like some coffee sir she stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot sergius taking her hand thank you louka louka pretending to pull oh sir you know i didnt mean that im surprised at you sergius coming clear of the table and drawing her with him i am surprised at myself louka what would sergius the hero of slivnitza say if he saw me now what would sergius the apostle of the higher love say if he saw me now what would the half dozen sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome figure of mine say if they caught us here letting go her hand and slipping his arm dexterously round her waist do you consider my figure handsome louka louka let me go sir i shall be disgraced she struggles he holds her inexorably oh will you let go sergius looking straight into her eyes no louka then stand back where we cant be seen have you no common sense sergius ah thats reasonable he takes her into the stableyard gateway where they are hidden from the house louka complaining i may have been seen from the windows miss raina is sure to be spying about after you sergius stungletting her go take care louka i may be worthless enough to betray the higher love but do not you insult it louka demurely not for the world sir im sure may i go on with my work please now sergius again putting his arm round her you are a provoking little witch louka if you were in love with me would you spy out of windows on me louka well you see sir since you say you are half a dozen different gentlemen all at once i should have a great deal to look after sergius charmed witty as well as pretty he tries to kiss her louka avoiding him no i dont want your kisses gentlefolk are all alikeyou making love to me behind miss rainas back and she doing the same behind yours sergius recoiling a step louka louka it shews how little you really care sergius dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness if our conversation is to continue louka you will please remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid louka its so hard to know what a gentleman considers right i thought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular sergius turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden from the gateway devil devil louka ha ha i expect one of the six of you is very like me sir though i am only miss rainas maid she goes back to her work at the table taking no further notice of him sergius speaking to himself which of the six is the real manthats the question that torments me one of them is a hero another a buffoon another a humbug another perhaps a bit of a blackguard he pauses and looks furtively at louka as he adds with deep bitterness and one at least is a cowardjealous like all cowards he goes to the table louka louka yes sergius who is my rival louka you shall never get that out of me for love or money sergius why louka never mind why besides you would tell that i told you and i should lose my place sergius holding out his right hand in affirmation no on the honor of ahe checks himself and his hand drops nerveless as he concludes sardonicallyof a man capable of behaving as i have been behaving for the last five minutes who is he louka i dont know i never saw him i only heard his voice through the door of her room sergius damnation how dare you louka retreating oh i mean no harm youve no right to take up my words like that the mistress knows all about it and i tell you that if that gentleman ever comes here again miss raina will marry him whether he likes it or not i know the difference between the sort of manner you and she put on before one another and the real manner sergius shivers as if she had stabbed him then setting his face like iron he strides grimly to her and grips her above the elbows with both bands sergius now listen you to me louka wincing not so tight youre hurting me sergius that doesnt matter you have stained my honor by making me a party to your eavesdropping and you have betrayed your mistress louka writhing please sergius that shews that you are an abominable little clod of common clay with the soul of a servant he lets her go as if she were an unclean thing and turns away dusting his hands of her to the bench by the wall where he sits down with averted head meditating gloomily louka whimpering angrily with her hands up her sleeves feeling her bruised arms you know how to hurt with your tongue as well as with your hands but i dont care now ive found out that whatever clay im made of youre made of the same as for her shes a liar and her fine airs are a cheat and im worth six of her she shakes the pain off hardily tosses her head and sets to work to put the things on the tray he looks doubtfully at her once or twice she finishes packing the tray and laps the cloth over the edges so as to carry all out together as she stoops to lift it he rises sergius louka she stops and looks defiantly at him with the tray in her hands a gentleman has no right to hurt a woman under any circumstances with profound humility uncovering his head i beg your pardon louka that sort of apology may satisfy a lady of what use is it to a servant sergius thus rudely crossed in his chivalry throws it off with a bitter laugh and says slightingly oh you wish to be paid for the hurt he puts on his shako and takes some money from his pocket louka her eyes filling with tears in spite of herself no i want my hurt made well sergius sobered by her tone how she rolls up her left sleeve clasps her arm with the thumb and fingers of her right hand and looks down at the bruise then she raises her head and looks straight at him finally with a superb gesture she presents her arm to be kissed amazed he looks at her at the arm at her again hesitates and then with shuddering intensity exclaims sergius never and gets away as far as possible from her her arm drops without a word and with unaffected dignity she takes her tray and is approaching the house when raina returns wearing a hat and jacket in the height of the vienna fashion of the previous year 1885 louka makes way proudly for her and then goes into the house raina im ready whats the matter gaily have you been flirting with louka sergius hastily no no how can you think such a thing raina ashamed of herself forgive me dear it was only a jest i am so happy today he goes quickly to her and kisses her hand remorsefully catherine comes out and calls to them from the top of the steps catherine coming down to them i am sorry to disturb you children but paul is distracted over those three regiments he does not know how to get them to phillipopolis and he objects to every suggestion of mine you must go and help him sergius he is in the library raina disappointed but we are just going out for a walk sergius i shall not be long wait for me just five minutes he runs up the steps to the door raina following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at him with timid coquetry i shall go round and wait in full view of the library windows be sure you draw fathers attention to me if you are a moment longer than five minutes i shall go in and fetch you regiments or no regiments sergius laughing very well he goes in raina watches him until he is out of her sight then with a perceptible relaxation of manner she begins to pace up and down about the garden in a brown study catherine imagine their meeting that swiss and hearing the whole story the very first thing your father asked for was the old coat we sent him off in a nice mess you have got us into raina gazing thoughtfully at the gravel as she walks the little beast catherine little beast what little beast raina to go and tell oh if i had him here id stuff him with chocolate creams till he couldnt ever speak again catherine dont talk nonsense tell me the truth raina how long was he in your room before you came to me raina whisking round and recommencing her march in the opposite direction oh i forget catherine you cannot forget did he really climb up after the soldiers were gone or was he there when that officer searched the room raina no yes i think he must have been there then catherine you think oh raina raina will anything ever make you straightforward if sergius finds out it is all over between you raina with cool impertinence oh i know sergius is your pet i sometimes wish you could marry him instead of me you would just suit him you would pet him and spoil him and mother him to perfection catherine opening her eyes very widely indeed well upon my word raina capriciouslyhalf to herself i always feel a longing to do or say something dreadful to himto shock his proprietyto scandalize the five senses out of him to catherine perversely i dont care whether he finds out about the chocolate cream soldier or not i half hope he may she again turns flippantly away and strolls up the path to the corner of the house catherine and what should i be able to say to your father pray raina over her shoulder from the top of the two steps oh poor father as if he could help himself she turns the corner and passes out of sight catherine looking after her her fingers itching oh if you were only ten years younger louka comes from the house with a salver which she carries hanging down by her side well louka theres a gentleman just called madama servian officer catherine flaming a servian how dare hechecking herself bitterly oh i forgot we are at peace now i suppose we shall have them calling every day to pay their compliments well if he is an officer why dont you tell your master he is in the library with major saranoff why do you come to me louka but he asks for you madam and i dont think he knows who you are he said the lady of the house he gave me this little ticket for you she takes a card out of her bosom puts it on the salver and offers it to catherine catherine reading captain bluntschli thats a german name louka swiss madam i think catherine with a bound that makes louka jump back swiss what is he like louka timidly he has a big carpet bag madam catherine oh heavens hes come to return the coat send him awaysay were not at homeask him to leave his address and ill write to himoh stop that will never do wait she throws herself into a chair to think it out louka waits the master and major saranoff are busy in the library arent they louka yes madam catherine decisively bring the gentleman out here at once

the gate of the stable yard tell nicola to bring his bag here after him dont forget louka surprised his bag catherine yes here as soon as possible vehemently be quick louka runs into the house catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush she then takes up the salver and uses it as a mirror with the result that the handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron a touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable oh howhowhow can a man be such a fool such a moment to select louka appears at the door of the house announcing captain bluntschli and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass before she goes in again he is the man of the adventure in rainas room he is now clean well brushed smartly uniformed and out of trouble but still unmistakably the same man the moment loukas back is turned catherine swoops on him with hurried urgent coaxing appeal captain bluntschli i am very glad to see you but you must leave this house at once he raises his eyebrows my husband has just returned with my future soninlaw and they know nothing if they did the consequences would be terrible you are a foreigner you do not feel our national animosities as we do we still hate the servians the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey if he discovered our secret he would never forgive me and my daughters life would hardly be safe will you like the chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are leave at once before he finds you here bluntschli disappointed but philosophical at once gracious lady i only came to thank you and return the coat you lent me if you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with your servant as i pass out i need detain you no further he turns to go into the house catherine catching him by the sleeve oh you must not think of going back that way coaxing him across to the stable gates this is the shortest way out many thanks so glad to have been of service to you goodbye bluntschli but my bag catherine it will be sent on you will leave me your address bluntschli true allow me he takes out his cardcase and stops to write his address keeping catherine in an agony of impatience as he hands her the card petkoff hatless rushes from the house in a fluster of hospitality followed by sergius petkoff as he hurries down the steps my dear captain bluntschli catherine oh heavens she sinks on the seat against the wall petkoff too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes bluntschlis hand heartily those stupid people of mine thought i was out here instead of in thehawlibrary he cannot mention the library without betraying how proud he is of it i saw you through the window i was wondering why you didnt come in saranoff is with me you remember him dont you sergius saluting humorously and then offering his hand with great charm of manner welcome our friend the enemy petkoff no longer the enemy happily rather anxiously i hope youve come as a friend and not on business catherine oh quite as a friend paul i was just asking captain bluntschli to stay to lunch but he declares he must go at once sergius sardonically impossible bluntschli we want you here badly we have to send on three cavalry regiments to phillipopolis and we dont in the least know how to do it bluntschli suddenly attentive and businesslike phillipopolis the forage is the trouble eh petkoff eagerly yes thats it to sergius he sees the whole thing at once bluntschli i think i can shew you how to manage that sergius invaluable man come along towering over bluntschli he puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps petkoff following as bluntschli puts his foot on the first step raina comes out of the house raina completely losing her presence of mind oh the chocolate cream soldier bluntschli stands rigid sergius amazed looks at raina then at petkoff who looks back at him and then at his wife catherine with commanding presence of mind my dear raina dont you see that we have a guest herecaptain bluntschli one of our new servian friends raina bows bluntschli bows raina how silly of me she comes down into the centre of the group between bluntschli and petkoff i made a beautiful ornament this morning for the ice pudding and that stupid nicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it to bluntschli winningly i hope you didnt think that you were the chocolate cream soldier captain bluntschli bluntschli laughing i assure you i did stealing a whimsical glance at her your explanation was a relief petkoff suspiciously to raina and since when pray have you taken to cooking catherine oh whilst you were away it is her latest fancy petkoff testily and has nicola taken to drinking he used to be careful enough first he shews captain bluntschli out here when he knew quite well i was in thehumlibrary and then he goes downstairs and breaks rainas chocolate soldier he mustat this moment nicola appears at the top of the steps r with a carpet bag he descends places it respectfully before bluntschli and waits for further orders general amazement nicola unconscious of the effect he is producing looks perfectly satisfied with himself when petkoff recovers his power of speech he breaks out at him with are you mad nicola nicola taken aback sir petkoff what have you brought that for nicola my ladys orders sir louka told me that catherine interrupting him my orders why should i order you to bring captain bluntschlis luggage out here what are you thinking of nicola nicola after a moments bewilderment picking up the bag as he addresses bluntschli with the very perfection of servile discretion i beg your pardon sir i am sure to catherine my fault madam i hope youll overlook it he bows and is going to the steps with the bag when petkoff addresses him angrily petkoff youd better go and slam that bag too down on miss rainas ice pudding this is too much for nicola the bag drops from his hands on petkoffs corns eliciting a roar of anguish from him begone you butterfingered donkey nicola snatching up the bag and escaping into the house yes sir catherine oh never mind paul dont be angry petkoff muttering scoundrel hes got out of hand while i was away ill teach him recollecting his guest oh well never mind come bluntschli lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away you know very well youre not going back to switzerland yet until you do go back youll stay with us raina oh do captain bluntschli petkoff to catherine now catherine its of you that hes afraid press him and hell stay catherine of course i shall be only too delighted if appealingly captain bluntschli really wishes to stay he knows my wishes bluntschli in his driest military manner i am at madames orders sergius cordially that settles it petkoff heartily of course raina you see you must stay bluntschli smiling well if i must i must gesture of despair from catherine act iii in the library after lunch it is not much of a library its literary equipment consisting of a single fixed shelf stocked with old papercovered novels broken backed coffee stained torn and thumbed and a couple of little hanging shelves with a few gift books on them the rest of the wall space being occupied by trophies of war and the chase but it is a most comfortable sittingroom a row of three large windows in the front of the house shew a mountain panorama which is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in the mellowing afternoon light in the left hand corner a square earthenware stove a perfect tower of colored pottery rises nearly to the ceiling and guarantees plenty of warmth the ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of decorated cushions and the window seats are well upholstered divans little turkish tables one of them with an elaborate hookah on it and a screen to match them complete the handsome effect of the furnishing there is one object however which is hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings this is a small kitchen table much the worse for wear fitted as a writing table with an old canister full of pens an eggcup filled with ink and a deplorable scrap of severely used pink blotting paper at the side of this table which stands on the right bluntschli is hard at work with a couple of maps before him writing orders at the head of it sits sergius who is also supposed to be at work but who is actually gnawing the feather of a pen and contemplating bluntschlis quick sure businesslike progress with a mixture of envious irritation at his own incapacity and awestruck wonder at an ability which seems to him almost miraculous though its prosaic character forbids him to esteem it the major is comfortably established on the ottoman with a newspaper in his hand and the tube of the hookah within his reach catherine sits at the stove with her back to them embroidering raina reclining on the divan under the left hand window is gazing in a daydream out at the balkan landscape with a neglected novel in her lap the door is on the left the button of the electric bell is between the door and the fireplace petkoff looking up from his paper to watch how they are getting on at the table are you sure i cant help you in any way bluntschli bluntschli without interrupting his writing or looking up quite sure thank you saranoff and i will manage it sergius grimly yes well manage it he finds out what to do draws up the orders and i sign em division of labour major bluntschli passes him a paper another one thank you he plants the papers squarely before him sets his chair carefully parallel to them and signs with the air of a man resolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat this hand is more accustomed to the sword than to the pen petkoff its very good of you bluntschli it is indeed to let yourself be put upon in this way now are you quite sure i can do nothing catherine in a low warning tone you can stop interrupting paul petkoff starting and looking round at her eh oh quite right my love quite right he takes his newspaper up but lets it drop again ah you havent been campaigning catherine you dont know how pleasant it is for us to sit here after a good lunch with nothing to do but enjoy ourselves theres only one thing i want to make me thoroughly comfortable catherine what is that petkoff my old coat im not at home in this one i feel as if i were on parade catherine my dear paul how absurd you are about that old coat it must be hanging in the blue closet where you left it petkoff my dear catherine i tell you ive looked there am i to believe my own eyes or not catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace what are you shewing off that bell for she looks at him majestically and silently resumes her chair and her needlework my dear if you think the obstinacy of your sex can make a coat out of two old dressing gowns of rainas your waterproof and my mackintosh youre mistaken thats exactly what the blue closet contains at present nicola presents himself catherine unmoved by petkoffs sally nicola go to the blue closet and bring your masters old coat herethe braided one he usually wears in the house nicola yes madam nicola goes out petkoff catherine catherine yes paul petkoff i bet you any piece of jewellery you like to order from sofia against a weeks housekeeping money that the coat isnt there catherine done paul petkoff excited by the prospect of a gamble come heres an opportunity for some sport wholl bet on it bluntschli ill give you six to one bluntschli imperturbably it would be robbing you major madame is sure to be right without looking up he passes another batch of papers to sergius sergius also excited bravo switzerland major i bet my best charger against an arab mare for raina that nicola finds the coat in the blue closet petkoff eagerly your best char catherine hastily interrupting him dont be foolish paul an arabian mare will cost you 50000 levas raina suddenly coming out of her picturesque revery really mother if you are going to take the jewellery i dont see why you should grudge me my arab nicola comes back with the coat and brings it to petkoff who can hardly believe his eyes catherine where was it nicola nicola hanging in the blue closet madam petkoff well i am d catherine stopping him paul petkoff i could have sworn it wasnt there age is beginning to tell on me im getting hallucinations to nicola here help me to change excuse me bluntschli he begins changing coats nicola acting as valet remember i didnt take that bet of yours sergius youd better give raina that arab steed yourself since youve roused her expectations eh raina he looks round at her but she is again rapt in the landscape with a little gush of paternal affection and pride he points her out to them and says shes dreaming as usual sergius assuredly she shall not be the loser petkoff so much the better for her i shant come off so cheap i expect the change is now complete nicola goes out with the discarded coat ah now i feel at home at last he sits down and takes his newspaper with a grunt of relief bluntschli to sergius handing a paper thats the last order petkoff jumping up what finished bluntschli finished petkoff goes beside sergius looks curiously over his left shoulder as he signs and says with childlike envy havent you anything for me to sign bluntschli not necessary his signature will do petkoff ah well i think weve done a thundering good days work he goes away from the table can i do anything more bluntschli you had better both see the fellows that are to take these to sergius pack them off at once and shew them that ive marked on the orders the time they should hand them in by tell them that if they stop to drink or tell storiesif theyre five minutes late theyll have the skin taken off their backs sergius rising indignantly ill say so and if one of them is man enough to spit in my face for insulting him ill buy his discharge and give him a pension he strides out his humanity deeply outraged bluntschli confidentially just see that he talks to them properly major will you petkoff officiously quite right bluntschli quite right ill see to it he goes to the door importantly but hesitates on the threshold by the bye catherine you may as well come too theyll be far more frightened of you than of me catherine putting down her embroidery i daresay i had better you will only splutter at them she goes out petkoff holding the door for her and following her bluntschli what a country they make cannons out of cherry trees and the officers send for their wives to keep discipline he begins to fold and docket the papers raina who has risen from the divan strolls down the room with her hands clasped behind her and looks mischievously at him raina you look ever so much nicer than when we last met he looks up surprised what have you done to yourself bluntschli washed brushed good nights sleep and breakfast thats all raina did you get back safely that morning bluntschli quite thanks raina were they angry with you for running away from sergiuss charge bluntschli no they were glad because theyd all just run away themselves raina going to the table and leaning over it towards him it must have made a lovely story for themall that about me and my room bluntschli capital story but i only told it to one of thema particular friend raina on whose discretion you could absolutely rely bluntschli absolutely raina hm he told it all to my father and sergius the day you exchanged the prisoners she turns away and strolls carelessly across to the other side of the room bluntschli deeply concerned and half incredulous no you dont mean that do you raina turning with sudden earnestness i do indeed but they dont know that it was in this house that you hid if sergius knew he would challenge you and kill you in a duel bluntschli bless me then dont tell him raina full of reproach for his levity can you realize what it is to me to deceive him i want to be quite perfect with sergiusno meanness no smallness no deceit my relation to him is the one really beautiful and noble part of my life i hope you can understand that bluntschli sceptically you mean that you wouldnt like him to find out that the story about the ice pudding was aaayou know raina wincing ah dont talk of it in that flippant way i lied i know it but i did it to save your life he would have killed you that was the second time i ever uttered a falsehood bluntschli rises quickly and looks doubtfully and somewhat severely at her do you remember the first time bluntschli i no was i present raina yes and i told the officer who was searching for you that you were not present bluntschli true i should have remembered it raina greatly encouraged ah it is natural that you should forget it first it cost you nothing it cost me a liea lie she sits down on the ottoman looking straight before her with her hands clasped on her knee bluntschli quite touched goes to the ottoman with a particularly reassuring and considerate air and sits down beside her bluntschli my dear young lady dont let this worry you remember im a soldier now what are the two things that happen to a soldier so often that he comes to think nothing of them one is hearing people tell lies raina recoils the other is getting his life saved in all sorts of ways by all sorts of people raina rising in indignant protest and so he becomes a creature incapable of faith and of gratitude bluntschli making a wry face do you like gratitude i dont if pity is akin to love gratitude is akin to the other thing raina gratitude turning on him if you are incapable of gratitude you are incapable of any noble sentiment even animals are grateful oh i see now exactly what you think of me you were not surprised to hear me lie to you it was something i probably did every dayevery hour that is how men think of women she walks up the room melodramatically bluntschli dubiously theres reason in everything you said youd told only two lies in your whole life dear young lady isnt that rather a short allowance im quite a straightforward man myself but it wouldnt last me a whole morning raina staring haughtily at him do you know sir that you are insulting me bluntschli i cant help it when you get into that noble attitude and speak in that thrilling voice i admire you but i find it impossible to believe a single word you say raina superbly captain bluntschli bluntschli unmoved yes raina coming a little towards him as if she could not believe her senses do you mean what you said just now do you know what you said just now bluntschli i do raina gasping i i she points to herself incredulously meaning i raina petkoff tell lies he meets her gaze unflinchingly she suddenly sits down beside him and adds with a complete change of manner from the heroic to the familiar how did you find me out bluntschli promptly instinct dear young lady instinct and experience of the world raina wonderingly do you know you are the first man i ever met who did not take me seriously bluntschli you mean dont you that i am the first man that has ever taken you quite seriously raina yes i suppose i do mean that cosily quite at her ease with him how strange it is to be talked to in such a way you know ive always gone on like thati mean the noble attitude and the thrilling voice i did it when i was a tiny child to my nurse she believed in it i do it before my parents they believe in it i do it before sergius he believes in it bluntschli yes hes a little in that line himself isnt he raina startled do you think so bluntschli you know him better than i do raina i wonderi wonder is he if i thought that discouraged ah well what does it matter i suppose now that youve found me out you despise me bluntschli warmly rising no my dear young lady no no no a thousand times its part of your youthpart of your charm im like all the rest of themthe nurseyour parentssergius im your infatuated admirer raina pleased really bluntschli slapping his breast smartly with his hand german fashion hand aufs herz really and truly raina very happy but what did you think of me for giving you my portrait bluntschli astonished your portrait you never gave me your portrait raina quickly do you mean to say you never got it bluntschli no he sits down beside her with renewed interest and says with some complacency when did you send it to me raina indignantly i did not send it to you she turns her head away and adds reluctantly it was in the pocket of that coat bluntschli pursing his lips and rounding his eyes ohooh i never found it it must be there still raina springing up there stillfor my father to find the first time he puts his hand in his pocket oh how could you be so stupid bluntschli rising also it doesnt matter its only a photograph how can he tell who it was intended for tell him he put it there himself raina impatiently yes that is so cleverso clever what shall i do bluntschli ah i see you wrote something on it that was rash raina annoyed almost to tears oh to have done such a thing for you who care no moreexcept to laugh at meoh are you sure nobody has touched it bluntschli well i cant be quite sure you see i couldnt carry it about with me all the time one cant take much luggage on active service raina what did you do with it bluntschli when i got through to peerot i had to put it in safe keeping somehow i thought of the railway cloak room but thats the surest place to get looted in modern warfare so i pawned it raina pawned it bluntschli i know it doesnt sound nice but it was much the safest plan i redeemed it the day before yesterday heaven only knows whether the pawnbroker cleared out the pockets or not raina furiousthrowing the words right into his face you have a low shopkeeping mind you think of things that would never come into a gentlemans head bluntschli phlegmatically thats the swiss national character dear lady raina oh i wish i had never met you she flounces away and sits at the window fuming louka comes in with a heap of letters and telegrams on her salver and crosses with her bold free gait to the table her left sleeve is looped up to the shoulder with a brooch shewing her naked arm with a broad gilt bracelet covering the bruise louka to bluntschli for you she empties the salver recklessly on the table the messenger is waiting she is determined not to be civil to a servian even if she must bring him his letters bluntschli to raina will you excuse me the last postal delivery that reached me was three weeks ago these are the subsequent accumulations four telegramsa week old he opens one oho bad news raina rising and advancing a little remorsefully bad news bluntschli my fathers dead he looks at the telegram with his lips pursed musing on the unexpected change in his arrangements raina oh how very sad bluntschli yes i shall have to start for home in an hour he has left a lot of big hotels behind him to be looked after takes up a heavy letter in a long blue envelope heres a whacking letter from the family solicitor he pulls out the enclosures and glances over them great heavens seventy two hundred in a crescendo of dismay four hundred four thousand nine thousand six hundred what on earth shall i do with them all raina timidly nine thousand hotels bluntschli hotels nonsense if you only knewoh its too ridiculous excuse me i must give my fellow orders about starting he leaves the room hastily with the documents in his hand louka tauntingly he has not much heart that swiss though he is so fond of the servians he has not a word of grief for his poor father raina bitterly griefa man who has been doing nothing but killing people for years what does he care what does any soldier care she goes to the door evidently restraining her tears with difficulty louka major saranoff has been fighting too and he has plenty of heart left raina at the door looks haughtily at her and goes out aha i thought you wouldnt get much feeling out of your soldier she is following raina when nicola enters with an armful of logs for the fire nicola grinning amorously at her ive been trying all the afternoon to get a minute alone with you my girl his countenance changes as he notices her arm why what fashion is that of wearing your sleeve child louka proudly my own fashion nicola indeed if the mistress catches you shell talk to you he throws the logs down on the ottoman and sits comfortably beside them louka is that any reason why you should take it on yourself to talk to me nicola come dont be so contrary with me ive some good news for you he takes out some paper money louka with an eager gleam in her eyes comes close to look at it see a twenty leva bill sergius gave me that out of pure swagger a fool and his money are soon parted theres ten levas more the swiss gave me that for backing up the mistresss and rainas lies about him hes no fool he isnt you should have heard old catherine downstairs as polite as you please to me telling me not to mind the major being a little impatient for they knew what a good servant i wasafter making a fool and a liar of me before them all the twenty will go to our savings and you shall have the ten to spend if youll only talk to me so as to remind me im a human being i get tired of being a servant occasionally louka scornfully yes sell your manhood for thirty levas and buy me for ten keep your money you were born to be a servant i was not when you set up your shop you will only be everybodys servant instead of somebodys servant nicola picking up his logs and going to the stove ah wait till you see we shall have our evenings to ourselves and i shall be master in my own house i promise you he throws the logs down and kneels at the stove louka you shall never be master in mine she sits down on sergiuss chair nicola turning still on his knees and squatting down rather forlornly on his calves daunted by her implacable disdain you have a great ambition in you louka remember if any luck comes to you it was i that made a woman of you louka you nicola with dogged selfassertion yes me who was it made you give up wearing a couple of pounds of false black hair on your head and reddening your lips and cheeks like any other bulgarian girl i did who taught you to trim your nails and keep your hands clean and be dainty about yourself like a fine russian lady me do you hear that me she tosses her head defiantly and he rises illhumoredly adding more coolly ive often thought that if raina were out of the way and you just a little less of a fool and sergius just a little more of one you might come to be one of my grandest customers instead of only being my wife and costing me money louka i believe you would rather be my servant than my husband you would make more out of me oh i know that soul of yours nicola going up close to her for greater emphasis never you mind my soul but just listen to my advice if you want to be a lady your present behaviour to me wont do at all unless when were alone its too sharp and impudent and impudence is a sort of familiarity it shews affection for me and dont you try being high and mighty with me either youre like all country girls you think its genteel to treat a servant the way i treat a stableboy thats only your ignorance and dont you forget it and dont be so ready to defy everybody act as if you expected to have your own way not as if you expected to be ordered about the way to get on as a lady is the same as the way to get on as a servant youve got to know your place thats the secret of it and you may depend on me to know my place if you get promoted think over it my girl ill stand by you one servant should always stand by another louka rising impatiently oh i must behave in my own way you take all the courage out of me with your coldblooded wisdom go and put those logs on the fire thats the sort of thing you understand before nicola can retort sergius comes in he checks himself a moment on seeing louka then goes to the stove sergius to nicola i am not in the way of your work i hope nicola in a smooth elderly manner oh no sir thank you kindly i was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit of running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance to look at the books thats the worst of her education sir it gives her habits above her station to louka make that table tidy louka for the major he goes out sedately louka without looking at sergius begins to arrange the papers on the table he crosses slowly to her and studies the arrangement of her sleeve reflectively sergius let me see is there a mark there he turns up the bracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp she stands motionless not looking at him fascinated but on her guard ffff does it hurt louka yes sergius shall i cure it louka instantly withdrawing herself proudly but still not looking at him no you cannot cure it now sergius masterfully quite sure he makes a movement as if to take her in his arms louka dont trifle with me please an officer should not trifle with a servant sergius touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his forefinger that was no trifle louka louka no looking at him for the first time are you sorry sergius with measured emphasis folding his arms i am never sorry louka wistfully i wish i could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as that i wonder are you really a brave man sergius unaffectedly relaxing his attitude yes i am a brave man my heart jumped like a womans at the first shot but in the charge i found that i was brave yes that at least is real about me louka did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are poor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich like you sergius with bitter levity not a bit they all slashed and cursed and yelled like heroes psha the courage to rage and kill is cheap i have an english bull terrier who has as much of that sort of courage as the whole bulgarian nation and the whole russian nation at its back but he lets my groom thrash him all the same thats your soldier all over no louka your poor men can cut throats but they are afraid of their officers they put up with insults and blows they stand by and see one another punished like childrenaye and help to do it when they are ordered and the officerswell with a short bitter laugh i am an officer oh fervently give me the man who will defy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets itself up against his own will and conscience he alone is the brave man louka how easy it is to talk men never seem to me to grow up they all have schoolboys ideas you dont know what true courage is sergius ironically indeed i am willing to be instructed louka look at me how much am i allowed to have my own will i have to get your room ready for youto sweep and dust to fetch and carry how could that degrade me if it did not degrade you to have it done for you but with subdued passion if i were empress of russia above everyone in the world thenah then though according to you i could shew no courage at all you should see you should see sergius what would you do most noble empress louka i would marry the man i loved which no other queen in europe has the courage to do if i loved you though you would be as far beneath me as i am beneath you i would dare to be the equal of my inferior would you dare as much if you loved me no if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let it grow you dare not you would marry a rich mans daughter because you would be afraid of what other people would say of you sergius carried away you lie it is not so by all the stars if i loved you and i were the czar himself i would set you on the throne by my side you know that i love another woman a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth and you are jealous of her louka i have no reason to be she will never marry you now the man i told you of has come back she will marry the swiss sergius recoiling the swiss louka a man worth ten of you then you can come to me and i will refuse you you are not good enough for me she turns to the door sergius springing after her and catching her fiercely in his arms i will kill the swiss and afterwards i will do as i please with you louka in his arms passive and steadfast the swiss will kill you perhaps he has beaten you in love he may beat you in war sergius tormentedly do you think i believe that sheshe whose worst thoughts are higher than your best ones is capable of trifling with another man behind my back louka do you think she would believe the swiss if he told her now that i am in your arms sergius releasing her in despair damnation oh damnation mockery mockery everywhere everything i think is mocked by everything i do he strikes himself frantically on the breast coward liar fool shall i kill myself like a man or live and pretend to laugh at myself she again turns to go louka she stops near the door remember you belong to me louka quietly what does that meanan insult sergius commandingly it means that you love me and that i have had you here in my arms and will perhaps have you there again whether that is an insult i neither know nor care take it as you please but vehemently i will not be a coward and a trifler if i choose to love you i dare marry you in spite of all bulgaria if these hands ever touch you again they shall touch my affianced bride louka we shall see whether you dare keep your word but take care i will not wait long sergius again folding his arms and standing motionless in the middle of the room yes we shall see and you shall wait my pleasure bluntschli much preoccupied with his papers still in his hand enters leaving the door open for louka to go out he goes across to the table glancing at her as he passes sergius without altering his resolute attitude watches him steadily louka goes out leaving the door open bluntschli absently sitting at the table as before and putting down his papers thats a remarkable looking young woman sergius gravely without moving captain bluntschli bluntschli eh sergius you have deceived me you are my rival i brook no

is that he makes love to her sergius false monstrous raina monstrous confronting him do you deny that she told you about captain bluntschli being in my room sergius no but raina interrupting do you deny that you were making love to her when she told you sergius no but i tell you raina cutting him short contemptuously it is unnecessary to tell us anything more that is quite enough for us she turns her back on him and sweeps majestically back to the window bluntschli quietly as sergius in an agony of mortification sinks on the ottoman clutching his averted head between his fists i told you you were getting the worst of it saranoff sergius tiger cat raina running excitedly to bluntschli you hear this man calling me names captain bluntschli bluntschli what else can he do dear lady he must defend himself somehow come very persuasively dont quarrel what good does it do raina with a gasp sits down on the ottoman and after a vain effort to look vexedly at bluntschli she falls a victim to her sense of humor and is attacked with a disposition to laugh sergius engaged to nicola he rises ha ha going to the stove and standing with his back to it ah well bluntschli you are right to take this huge imposture of a world coolly raina to bluntschli with an intuitive guess at his state of mind i daresay you think us a couple of grown up babies dont you sergius grinning a little he does he

friendly way where is this other young lady raina listening at the door probably sergius shivering as if a bullet had struck him and speaking with quiet but deep indignation i will prove that that at

r as he cries judge her bluntschliyou the moderate cautious man judge the eavesdropper louka stands her ground proud and silent bluntschli shaking his head i mustnt judge her i once listened myself outside a tent when there was a mutiny brewing its all a question of the degree of provocation my life was at stake louka my love was at stake sergius flinches ashamed of her in spite of himself i am not ashamed raina contemptuously your love your curiosity you mean louka facing her and retorting her contempt with interest my love stronger than anything you can feel even for your chocolate cream soldier sergius with quick suspicionto louka what does that mean louka fiercely it means sergius interrupting her slightingly oh i remember the ice pudding a paltry taunt girl major petkoff enters in

nicola and do you put some more wood on the fire she takes the coat and brings it to the major who stands up to put it on nicola attends to the fire petkoff to raina teasing her affectionately aha

the photograph from the pocket and throws it on the table before bluntschli who covers it with a sheet of paper under the very nose of sergius who looks on amazed with his suspicions roused in the highest degree she then helps petkoff on with his coat there dear now are you comfortable petkoff quite little love thanks he sits down and raina returns to her seat near the stove oh by the bye ive

married raina with deep reproach you said you were bluntschli i did not i positively did not i never was married in my life petkoff exasperated raina will you kindly inform me if i am not asking too much which gentleman you are engaged to raina to neither of them this young lady introducing louka who faces them all proudly is the object of major saranoffs affections at present petkoff louka are you mad sergius why this girls engaged to nicola nicola coming forward i beg your pardon sir there is a mistake louka is not engaged to me petkoff not engaged to you you scoundrel why you had twentyfive levas from me on the day of your betrothal and she had that gilt bracelet from miss raina nicola with cool unction we gave it out so sir but it was only to give louka protection she had a soul above her station and i have been no more than her confidential servant i intend as you know sir to set up a shop later on in sofia and i look forward to her custom and recommendation should she marry into the nobility he goes out with impressive discretion leaving them all staring after him petkoff breaking the silence well i amhm sergius this is either the finest heroism or the most crawling baseness which is it bluntschli bluntschli never mind whether its heroism or baseness nicolas the ablest man ive met in bulgaria ill make him manager of a hotel if he can speak french and german louka suddenly breaking out at sergius i have been insulted by everyone here you set them the example you owe me an apology sergius immediately like a repeating clock of which the spring has

sergius approvingly you are right he bends his knee in his grandest manner forgive me louka i forgive you she timidly gives him her hand which he kisses that touch makes me your affianced wife sergius springing up ah i forgot that louka coldly you can withdraw if you like sergius withdraw never you belong to me he puts his arm about her and draws her to him catherine comes in and finds louka in sergiuss arms and all the rest gazing at them in bewildered astonishment catherine what does this mean sergius releases louka petkoff well my dear it appears that sergius is going to marry louka instead of raina she is about to break out indignantly at him he stops her by exclaiming testily dont blame me ive nothing to do with it he retreats to the stove catherine marry louka sergius you are bound by your word to us sergius folding his arms nothing binds me bluntschli much pleased by this piece of common sense saranoff your hand my congratulations these heroics of yours have their practical side after all to louka gracious young lady the best wishes of a good republican he kisses her hand to rainas great disgust catherine threateningly louka you have been telling stories louka i have done raina no harm catherine haughtily raina raina is equally indignant at the liberty louka i have a right to call her raina she calls me louka i told major saranoff she would never marry him if the swiss gentleman came back bluntschli surprised hallo louka turning to raina i thought you were fonder of him than of sergius you know best whether i was right bluntschli what nonsense i assure

fifteen years of barracks and battlesa vagabonda man who has spoiled all his chances in life through an incurably romantic dispositiona man sergius starting as if a needle had pricked him and interrupting bluntschli in incredulous amazement excuse me bluntschli what did you say had spoiled your chances in life bluntschli promptly an incurably romantic disposition i ran away from home twice when i was a boy i went into the army instead of into my fathers business i climbed the balcony of this house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest cellar i came sneaking back here to have another look at the young lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat back petkoff my coat bluntschliyes thats the coat i meanwould have sent it back and gone quietly home do you suppose i am the sort of fellow a young girl falls in love with why look at our ages im thirtyfour i dont suppose the young lady is much over seventeen this estimate produces a marked sensation all the rest turning and staring at one another he proceeds innocently all that adventure which was life or death to me was only a schoolgirls game to herchocolate creams and hide and seek heres the proof he takes the photograph from the table now i ask you would a woman who took the affair seriously have sent me this and written on it raina to her chocolate cream soldiera souvenir he exhibits the photograph triumphantly as if it settled the matter beyond all possibility of refutation petkoff thats what i was looking for how the deuce did it get there bluntschli to raina complacently i have put everything right i hope gracious young lady raina in uncontrollable vexation i quite agree with your account of yourself you are a romantic idiot bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback next time i hope you will know the difference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of twentythree bluntschli stupefied twentythree she snaps the photograph contemptuously from his hand tears it across and throws the pieces at his feet sergius with grim enjoyment of bluntschlis discomfiture bluntschli my one last belief is gone your sagacity is a fraud like all the other things you have less sense than even i have bluntschli overwhelmed twentythree twentythree he considers hm swiftly making up his mind in that case major petkoff i beg to propose formally to become a suitor for your daughters hand in place of major saranoff retired raina you dare bluntschli if you were twentythree when you said those things to me this afternoon i shall take them seriously catherine loftily polite i doubt sir

families in the country our position is almost historical we can go back for nearly twenty years petkoff oh never mind that catherine to bluntschli we should be most happy bluntschli if it were only a question of your position but hang it you know raina is accustomed to a very comfortable establishment sergius keeps twenty horses bluntschli but what on earth is the use of twenty horses why its a circus catherine severely my daughter sir is accustomed to a firstrate stable raina hush mother youre making me ridiculous bluntschli oh well if it comes to a question of an establishment here goes he

a starving man you accepted me you gave me your hand to kiss your bed to sleep in and your roof to shelter me raina interrupting him i did not give them to the emperor of switzerland bluntschli thats

bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world miss hardcastle eh you have frozen me to death again that word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments a reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband hardcastle on the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues it was the very feature in his character that first struck me miss hardcastle he must have more striking features to catch me i promise you however if he be so young so handsome and so everything as you mention i believe hell do still i think ill have him hardcastle ay kate but there is still an obstacle its more than an even wager he may not have you miss hardcastle my dear papa why will you mortify one sowell if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference ill only break my glass for its flattery set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer hardcastle bravely resolved in the mean time ill go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first days muster exit miss hardcastle alone lud this news of papas puts me all in a flutter young handsome these he put last but i put them foremost sensible goodnatured i like all that but then reserved and sheepish thats much against him yet cant he be cured of his timidity by

as i live the most intimate friend of mr hastings my admirer they are never asunder i believe you must have seen him when we lived in town miss hardcastle never miss neville hes a very singular character i assure you among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me miss hardcastle an odd character indeed i shall never be able to manage him what shall i do pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success but how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother tony as usual miss neville i have just come from one of our agreeable teteatetes she has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection miss hardcastle and her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so a fortune like yours is no small temptation besides as she has the sole management of it im not surprised to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family miss neville a fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation but at any rate if my dear hastings be but constant i make no doubt to be too hard for her at last however i let her suppose that i am in love with her son and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another miss hardcastle my good brother holds out stoutly i could almost love him for hating you so miss neville it is a goodnatured creature at bottom and im sure would wish to see me married to anybody but

talk and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating diggory by the laws your worship thats parfectly unpossible whenever diggory

welcome gentlemen very welcome this way hastings after the disappointments of the day welcome once more charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable marlow the usual fate of a large mansion having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn hastings as you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries i have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece though not actually put in the bill inflame a reckoning confoundedly marlow travellers george must pay in all places the only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved hastings you have lived very much among them in truth i have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance marlow the englishmans malady but tell me george where could i have learned that assurance you talk of my life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence i dont know that i was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest womanexcept my motherbut among females of another class you know hastings ay among them you are impudent enough of all conscience marlow they are of us you know hastings but in the company of women of reputation i never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room marlow why man thats because i do want to steal out of the room faith i have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate but i dont know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution an impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but ill be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence hastings if you could but say half the fine things to them that i have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bedmaker marlow why george i cant say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me they may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle but to me a modest woman drest out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation hastings ha ha ha at this rate man how can you ever expect to marry marlow never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy if indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured but to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of madam will you marry me no no thats a strain much above me i assure you hastings i pity you but how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father marlow as i behave to all other ladies bow very low answer yes or no to all her demandsbut for the rest i dont think i shall venture to look in her face till i see my fathers again hastings im surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover marlow to be explicit my dear hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own miss neville loves you the family dont know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honour do the rest hastings my dear marlow but ill suppress the emotion were i a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world i would apply to for assistance but miss nevilles person is all i ask and that is mine both from her deceased fathers consent and her own inclination marlow happy man you have talents and art to captivate any woman im doomd to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it i despise this stammer in my address and this awkward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliners prentice or one of the duchesses of drurylane pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us enter hardcastle hardcastle gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome which is mr marlow sir you are heartily welcome its not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire i like give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate i like to see their horses and trunks taken care of marlow aside he has got our names from the servants already to him we approve your caution and hospitality sir to hastings i have been thinking george of changing our travelling dresses in the morning i am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine hardcastle i beg mr marlow youll use no ceremony in this house hastings i fancy charles youre right the first blow is half the battle i intend opening the campaign with the white and gold hardcastle mr marlowmr hastingsgentlemenpray be under no constraint in this house this is libertyhall gentlemen you may do just as you please here marlow yet george if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over i think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat hardcastle your talking of a retreat mr marlow puts me in mind of the duke of marlborough when we went to besiege denain he first summoned the garrison marlow dont you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown hardcastle he first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men hastings i think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly hardcastle i say gentlemen as i was telling you be summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men marlow the girls like finery hardcastle which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war now says the duke of marlborough to george brooks that stood next to himyou must have heard of george brooksill pawn my dukedom says he but i take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood so marlow what my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour hardcastle punch sir aside this is the most unaccountable kind of modesty i ever met with marlow yes sir punch a glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable this is libertyhall you know hardcastle heres a cup sir marlow aside so this fellow in his libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases hardcastle taking the cup i hope youll find it to your mind i have prepared it with my own hands and i believe youll own the ingredients are tolerable will you be so good as to pledge me sir here mr marlow here is to our better acquaintance drinks marlow aside a very impudent fellow this but hes a character and ill humour him a little sir my service to you drinks hastings aside i see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that hes an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman marlow from the excellence of your cup my old friend i suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country warm work now and then at elections i suppose hardcastle no sir i have long given that work over since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business for us that sell ale hastings so then you have no turn for politics i find hardcastle not in the least there was a time indeed i fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better i left it to mend itself since that i no more trouble my head about hyder ally or ally cawn than about ally croker sir my service to you hastings so that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it hardcastle i do stir about a great deal thats certain half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour marlow after drinking and you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in westminsterhall hardcastle ay young gentleman that and a little philosophy marlow aside well this is the first time i ever heard of an innkeepers philosophy hastings so then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter if you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this heres your health my philosopher drinks hardcastle good very good thank you ha ha your generalship puts me in mind of prince eugene when he fought the turks at the battle of belgrade you shall hear marlow instead of the battle of belgrade i believe its almost time to talk about supper what has your philosophy got in the house for supper hardcastle for supper sir aside was ever such a request to a man in his own house marlow yes sir supper sir i begin to feel an appetite i shall make devilish work tonight in the larder i promise you hardcastle aside such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld to him why really sir as for supper i cant well tell my dorothy and the cookmaid settle these things between them i leave these kind of things entirely to them marlow you do do you hardcastle entirely by the bye i believe they are in actual consultation upon whats for supper this moment in the kitchen marlow then i beg theyll admit me as one of their privy council its a way i have got when i travel i always chose to regulate my own supper let the cook be called no offence i hope sir hardcastle o no sir none in the least yet i dont know how our bridget the cookmaid is not very communicative upon these occasions should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house hastings lets see your list of the larder then i ask it as a favour i always match my appetite to my bill of fare marlow to hardcastle who looks at them with surprise sir hes very right and its my way too hardcastle sir you have a right to command here here roger bring us the bill of fare for tonights supper i believe its drawn outyour manner mr hastings puts me in mind of my uncle colonel wallop it was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it hastings aside all upon the high rope his uncle a colonel we shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace but lets hear the bill of fare marlow perusing whats here for the first course for the second course for the dessert the devil sir do you think we have brought down a whole joiners company or the corporation of bedford to eat up such a supper two or three little things clean and comfortable will do hastings but lets hear it marlow reading for the first course at the top a pig and prune sauce hastings damn your pig i say marlow and damn your prune sauce say i hardcastle and yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with prune sauce is very good eating marlow at the bottom a calfs tongue and brains hastings let your brains be knocked out my good sir i dont like them marlow or you may clap them on a plate by themselves i do hardcastle aside their impudence confounds me to them gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen marlow item a pork pie a boiled rabbit and sausages a florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tifftafftaffety cream hastings confound your made dishes i shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the french ambassadors table im for plain eating hardcastle im sorry gentlemen that i have nothing you like but if there be anything you have a particular fancy to marlow why really sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another send us what you please so much for supper and now to see that our beds are aired and properly taken care of hardcastle i entreat youll leave that to me you shall not stir a step marlow leave that to you i protest sir you must excuse me i always look to these things myself hardcastle i must insist sir youll make yourself easy on that head marlow you see im resolved on it aside a very troublesome fellow this as i ever met with hardcastle well sir im resolved at least to attend you aside this may be modern modesty but i never saw anything look so like oldfashioned impudence exeunt marlow and hardcastle hastings alone so i find this fellows civilities begin to grow troublesome but who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him ha what do i see miss neville by all thats happy enter miss neville miss neville my dear hastings to what unexpected good fortune to what accident am i to ascribe this happy meeting hastings rather let me ask the same question as i could never have hoped to meet my dearest constance at an inn miss neville an inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here what could induce you to think this house an inn hastings my friend mr marlow with whom i came down and i have been sent here as to an inn i assure you a young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither miss neville certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousins tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha hastings he whom your aunt intends for you he of whom i have such just apprehensions miss neville you have nothing to fear from him i assure you youd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me my aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest hastings thou dear dissembler you must know my constance i have just seized this happy opportunity of my friends visit here to get admittance into the family the horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but theyll soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful hastings we shall soon be landed in france where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected miss neville i have often told you that though ready to obey you i yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance the greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the india director and chiefly consists in jewels i have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them i fancy im very near succeeding the instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours hastings perish the baubles your person is all i desire in the mean time my friend marlow must not be let into his mistake i know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution miss neville but how shall we keep him in the deception miss hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive himthis this waythey confer enter marlow marlow the assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond bearing my host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back they talk of coming to sup with us too and then i suppose we are to run the gantlet through all the rest of the familywhat have we got here hastings my dear charles let me congratulate youthe most fortunate accidentwho do you think is just alighted marlow cannot guess hastings our mistresses boy miss hardcastle and miss neville give me leave to introduce miss constance neville to your acquaintance happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here miss hardcastle has just stept into the next room and will be back in an instant wasnt it lucky eh marlow aside i have been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment hastings well but wasnt it the most fortunate thing in the world marlow oh yes very fortunatea most joyful encounterbut our dresses george you know are in disorderwhat if we should postpone the happiness till tomorrowtomorrow at her own houseit will be every bit as convenientand rather more respectfultomorrow let it be offering to go miss neville by no means sir your ceremony will displease her the disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her marlow o the devil how shall i support it hem hem hastings you must not go you are to assist me you know i shall be confoundedly ridiculous yet hang it ill take courage hem hastings pshaw man its but the first plunge and alls over shes but a woman you know marlow and of all women she that i dread most to encounter enter miss hardcastle as returned from walking a bonnet etc hastings introducing them miss hardcastle mr marlow im proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other miss hardcastle aside now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner after a pause in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted im glad of your safe arrival sir im told you had some accidents by the way marlow only a few madam yes we had some yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorrymadamor rather glad of any accidentsthat are so agreeably concluded hem hastings to him you never spoke better in your whole life keep it up and ill insure you the victory miss hardcastle im afraid you flatter sir you that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country marlow gathering courage i have lived indeed in the world madam but i have kept very little company i have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it miss neville but that i am told is the way to enjoy it at last hastings to him cicero never spoke better once more and you are confirmed in assurance for ever marlow to him hem stand by me then and when im down throw in a word or two to set me up again miss hardcastle an observer like you upon life were i fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve marlow pardon me madam i was always willing to be amused the folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness hastings to him bravo bravo never spoke so well in your whole life well miss hardcastle i see that you and mr marlow are going to be very good company i believe our being here will but embarrass the interview marlow not in the least mr hastings we like your company of all things to him zounds george sure you wont go how can you leave us hastings our presence will but spoil conversation so well retire to the next room to him you dont consider man that we are to manage a little teteatete of our own exeunt miss hardcastle after a pause but you have not been wholly an observer i presume sir the ladies i should hope have employed some part of your addresses marlow relapsing into timidity pardon me madam iiias yet have studiedonlytodeserve them miss hardcastle and that some say is the very worst way to obtain them marlow perhaps so madam but i love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex but im afraid i grow tiresome miss hardcastle not at all sir there is nothing i like so much as grave conversation myself i could hear it for ever indeed i have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart marlow itsa diseaseof the mind madam in the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relishforumaum miss hardcastle i understand you sir there must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting marlow my meaning madam but infinitely better expressed and i cant help observinga miss hardcastle aside who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions to him you were going to observe sir marlow i was observing madami protest madam i forget what i was going to observe miss hardcastle aside i vow and so do i to him you were observing sir that in this age of hypocrisysomething about hypocrisy sir marlow yes madam in this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict inquiry do notaaa miss hardcastle i understand you perfectly sir marlow aside egad and thats more than i do myself miss hardcastle you mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it marlow true madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms but im sure i tire you madam miss hardcastle not in the least sir theres something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and forcepray sir go on marlow yes madam i was sayingthat there are some occasions when a total want of courage madam destroys all theand puts usupon aaa miss hardcastle i agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel i beg youll proceed marlow yes madam morally speaking madambut i see miss neville expecting us in the next room i would not intrude for the world miss hardcastle i protest sir i never was more agreeably entertained in all my life pray go on marlow yes madam i wasbut she beckons us to join her madam shall i do myself the honour to attend you miss hardcastle well then ill follow marlow aside this pretty smooth dialogue has done for me exit miss hardcastle alone ha ha ha was there ever such a sober sentimental interview im certain he scarce looked in my face the whole time yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too he has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance if i could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that i know of a piece of service but who is that somebodythat faith is a question i can scarce answer exit enter tony and miss neville followed by mrs hardcastle and hastings tony what do you follow me for cousin con i wonder youre not ashamed to be so very engaging miss neville i hope cousin one may speak to ones own relations and not be to blame tony ay but i know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it wont do i tell you cousin con it wont do so i beg youll keep your distance i want no nearer relationship she follows coquetting him to the back scene mrs hardcastle well i vow mr hastings you are very entertaining theres nothing in the world i love to talk of so much as london and the fashions though i was never there myself hastings never there you amaze me from your air and manner i concluded you had been bred all your life either at ranelagh st jamess or tower wharf mrs hardcastle o sir youre only pleased to say so we country persons can have no manner at all im in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the pantheon the grotto gardens the borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort all i can do is to enjoy london at secondhand i take care to know every teteatete from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two miss rickets of crooked lane pray how do you like this head mr hastings hastings extremely elegant and degagee upon my word madam your friseur is a frenchman i suppose mrs hardcastle i protest i dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year hastings indeed such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady mayoress at a city ball mrs hardcastle i vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd hastings but that can never be your case madam in any dress bowing mrs hardcastle yet what signifies my dressing when i have such a piece of antiquity by my side as mr hardcastle all i can say will never argue down a single button from his clothes i have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaster it over like my lord pately with powder hastings you are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old mrs hardcastle but what do you think his answer was why with his usual gothic vivacity he said i only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tete for my own wearing hastings intolerable at your age you may wear what you please and it must become you mrs hardcastle pray mr hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town hastings some time ago forty was all the mode but im told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter mrs hardcastle seriously then i shall be too young for the fashion hastings no lady begins now to put on jewels till shes past forty for instance miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers mrs hardcastle and yet mrs niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all hastings your niece is she and that young gentleman a brother of yours i should presume mrs hardcastle my son sir they are contracted to each other observe their little sports they fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already to them well tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin constance this evening tony i have been saying no soft things but that its very hard to be followed about so ecod ive not a place in the house now thats left to myself but the stable mrs hardcastle never mind him con my dear hes

never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster tony ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two mrs hardcastle was ever the like but i see he wants to break my heart i

the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy exeunt mrs hardcastle and miss neville tony singing there was a young man riding by and fain would have his will rang do didlo deedont mind her let her cry its the comfort of her heart i have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry hastings then youre no friend to the ladies i find my pretty young gentleman tony thats as i find um hastings not to her of your mothers choosing i dare answer and yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl tony thats because you dont know her as well as i ecod i know every inch about her and theres not a more bitter cantankerous toad in all christendom hastings aside pretty encouragement this for a lover tony i have seen her since the height of that she has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first days breaking hastings to me she appears sensible and silent tony ay before company but when shes with her playmate shes as loud as a hog in a gate hastings but there is a meek modesty about her that charms me tony yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and youre flung in a ditch hastings well but you must allow her a little beautyyes you must allow her some beauty tony bandbox shes all a madeup thing mun ah could you but

this looks like a lad of spirit tony come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me singing we are the boys that fears no noise where the thundering cannons roar exeunt enter hardcastle alone hardcastle what could my old friend sir charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town to me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue he has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already he took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of im desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter she will certainly be shocked at it enter miss hardcastle plainly dressed hardcastle well my kate i see you have changed your dress as i bade you and yet i believe there was no great occasion miss hardcastle i find such a pleasure sir in obeying your commands that i take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety hardcastle and yet kate i sometimes give you some cause particularly when i recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today miss hardcastle you taught me to expect something extraordinary and i find the original exceeds the description hardcastle i was never so surprised in my life he has quite confounded all my faculties miss hardcastle i never saw anything like it and a man of the world too hardcastle ay he learned it all abroadwhat a fool was i to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling he might as soon learn wit at a masquerade miss hardcastle it seems all natural to him hardcastle a good deal assisted by bad company and a french dancingmaster miss hardcastle sure you mistake papa a french dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid lookthat awkward addressthat bashful manner hardcastle whose look whose manner child miss hardcastle mr marlows his mauvaise honte his timidity struck me at the first sight hardcastle then your first sight deceived you for i think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses miss hardcastle sure sir you rally i never saw any one so modest hardcastle and can you be serious i never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since i was born bully dawson was but a fool to him miss hardcastle surprising he met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground hardcastle he met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again miss hardcastle he treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam i would not for the world detain you hardcastle he spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when i was in my best story of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene he asked if i had not a good hand at making punch yes kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch miss hardcastle one of us must certainly be mistaken hardcastle if he be what he has shown himself im determined he shall never have my consent miss hardcastle and if he be the sullen thing i take him he shall never have mine hardcastle in one thing then we are agreedto reject him miss hardcastle yes but upon conditions for if you should find him less impudent and i more presumingif you find him more respectful and i more importunatei dont knowthe fellow is well enough for a mancertainly we dont meet many such at a horserace in the country hardcastle if we should find him sobut thats impossible the first appearance has done my business im seldom deceived in that miss hardcastle and yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance hardcastle ay when a girl finds a fellows outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture with her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue miss hardcastle i hope sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense wont end with a sneer at my understanding hardcastle pardon me kate but if young mr brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps miss hardcastle and as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries

resolved to keep up the delusion tell me pimple how do you like my present dress dont you think i look something like cherry in the beaux stratagem maid its the dress madam that every lady wears in the country but when she visits or receives company miss hardcastle and are you sure he does not remember my face or person maid certain of it miss hardcastle i vow i thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me maid but what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake miss hardcastle in the first place i shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market then i shall perhaps make an acquaintance and thats no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex but my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giants force before i offer to combat maid but you are sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person miss hardcastle never fear me i think i have got the true bar cantdid your honour callattend the lion therepipes and tobacco for the angelthe lamb has been outrageous this halfhour maid it will do madam but hes here exit maid enter

parts french i suppose we sell no french wines here sir marlow of true english growth i assure you miss hardcastle then its odd i should not know it we brew all sorts of wines in this house and i have

child you use me extremely ill if you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and i can ever be acquainted miss hardcastle and who wants to be acquainted with you i want no such acquaintance not i im sure you did not treat miss hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner ill warrant me before her you looked dashed and kept bowing to the ground and talked for all the world as if you was before a justice of peace marlow aside egad she has hit it sure enough to her in awe of her child ha ha ha a mere awkward squinting thing no no i find you dont know me i laughed and rallied her a little but i was unwilling to be too severe no i could not be too severe curse me miss hardcastle o then sir you are a favourite i find among the ladies marlow yes my dear a great

now my angel such beauty fires beyond the power of resistancepshaw the father here my old luck i never nicked seven that i did not throw ames ace three times following exit marlow enter hardcastle who stands in surprise hardcastle so madam so i find this is your modest lover this is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground and only adored at humble distance kate kate art thou not ashamed to deceive your father so miss hardcastle never trust me dear papa but hes still the modest man i first took him for youll be convinced of it as well as i hardcastle by the hand of my body i believe his impudence is infectious didnt i see him seize your hand didnt i see him haul you about like a milkmaid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth miss hardcastle but if i shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age i hope youll forgive him hardcastle the girl would actually make one run mad i tell you ill not be convinced i am convinced he has scarce been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives you may like his impudence and call it modesty but my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications miss hardcastle sir i ask but this night to convince you hardcastle you shall not have half the time for i have thoughts of turning him out this very hour miss hardcastle give me that hour then and i hope to satisfy you hardcastle well an hour let it be then but ill have no trifling with your father all fair and open do

neville hastings you surprise me sir charles marlow expected here this night where have you had your information miss neville you may depend upon it i just saw his letter to mr hardcastle in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours after his son hastings then my constance all must be completed before he arrives he knows me and should he find me here would discover my name and perhaps my designs to the rest of the family miss neville the jewels i hope are safe hastings yes yes i have sent them to marlow who keeps the keys of our baggage in the mean time ill go to prepare matters

time ill go and amuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin exit enter marlow followed by a servant marlow i wonder what hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him when he knows the only place i have is the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor have you deposited the casket with the landlady as i ordered you have you put it into her own hands servant yes your honour marlow she said shed keep it safe did she servant yes she said shed keep it safe enough she asked me how i came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself exit servant marlow ha ha ha theyre safe however what an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst this little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family shes mine she must be mine or im greatly mistaken enter hastings hastings bless me i quite forgot to tell her that i intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden marlow here and in spirits too marlow give me joy george crown me shadow me with laurels well george after all we modest fellows dont want for success among the women hastings some women

bunch of keys to its girdle hastings well and what then marlow shes mine you rogue you such fire such motion such eyes such lips but egad she would not let me kiss them though hastings but are you so sure so very sure of her marlow why man she talked of showing me her work above stairs and i am to improve the pattern hastings but how can you charles go about to rob a woman of her honour marlow pshaw pshaw we all know the honour of the barmaid of an inn i dont intend to rob her take my word for it theres nothing in this house i shant honestly pay for hastings i believe the girl has virtue marlow and if she has i should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it hastings you have taken care i hope of the casket i sent you to lock up is it in safety marlow yes yes its safe enough i have taken care of it but how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor a place of safety ah numskull i have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourselfi have hastings what marlow i have sent it to the landlady to keep for you hastings to the landlady marlow the landlady hastings you did marlow i did shes to be answerable for its forthcoming you know hastings yes shell bring it forth with a witness marlow wasnt i right i believe youll allow that i acted prudently upon this occasion hastings aside he must not see my uneasiness marlow you seem a little disconcerted though methinks sure nothing has happened hastings no nothing never was in better spirits in all my life and so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge marlow rather too readily for she not only kept the casket but through her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too ha ha ha hastings he he he theyre safe however marlow as a guinea in a misers purse hastings aside so now all hopes of fortune are at an end and we must set off without it to him well charles ill leave you to your meditations on the pretty barmaid and he he

servant aside whats to be the wonder now hardcastle i believe sir you must be sensible sir that no man alive ought to be more welcome than your fathers son sir i hope you think so marlow i do from my soul sir i dont want much entreaty i generally make my fathers son welcome wherever he goes hardcastle i believe you do from my soul sir but though i say nothing to your own conduct that of your servants is insufferable their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house i assure you marlow i protest my very good sir that is no fault of mine if they dont drink as they ought they are to blame i ordered them not to spare the cellar i did i assure you to the side scene here let one of my servants come up to him my positive directions were that as i did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below hardcastle then they had your orders for what they do im satisfied marlow they had i assure you you shall hear from one of themselves enter servant drunk marlow you jeremy come forward sirrah what were my orders were you not told to drink freely and call for what you thought fit for the good of the house hardcastle aside i begin to lose my patience

such impudence curse me never in my whole life before hardcastle nor i confound me if ever i did to come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me this house is mine sir by all thats impudent it makes me laugh ha ha ha pray sir bantering as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture theres a pair of silver candlesticks and theres a firescreen and heres a pair of brazennosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them marlow bring me your bill sir bring me your bill and lets make no more words about it hardcastle there are a set of prints too what think you of the rakes progress for your own apartment marlow bring me your bill i say and ill leave you and your infernal house directly hardcastle then theres a mahogany table that you may see your own face in marlow my bill i say hardcastle i had forgot the great chair for your own particular slumbers after a hearty meal marlow zounds bring me my bill i say and lets hear no more ont hardcastle young man young man from your fathers letter to me i was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now i find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it exit marlow hows this sure i have not mistaken the house everything looks like an inn the servants cry coming the attendance is awkward the barmaid too to attend us but shes here and will further inform me whither so fast child a word with you enter miss hardcastle miss hardcastle let it be short then im in a hurry aside i believe be begins to find out his mistake but its too soon quite to undeceive him marlow pray child answer me one question what are you and what may your business in this house be miss hardcastle a relation of the family sir marlow what a poor relation miss hardcastle yes sir a poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them marlow that is you act as the barmaid of this inn miss hardcastle inn o lawwhat brought that in your head one of the best families in the country keep an innha ha ha old mr hardcastles house an inn marlow mr hardcastles house is this mr hardcastles house child miss hardcastle ay sure whose else should it be marlow so then alls out and i have been damnably imposed on o confound my stupid head i shall be laughed at over the whole town i shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops the dullissimo maccaroni to mistake this house of all others for an inn and my fathers old friend for an innkeeper what a swaggering puppy must he take me for what a silly puppy do i find myself there again may i be hanged my dear but i mistook you for the barmaid miss hardcastle dear me dear me im sure theres nothing in my behaviour to put me on a level with one of that stamp marlow nothing my dear nothing but i was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber my stupidity saw everything the wrong way i mistook your assiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement but its over this house i no more show my face in miss hardcastle i hope sir i have done nothing to disoblige you im sure i should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me im sure i should be sorry pretending to cry if he left the family upon my account im sure i should be sorry if people said anything amiss since i have no fortune but my character marlow aside by heaven she weeps this is the first mark of tenderness i ever had from a modest woman and it touches me to her excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family i leave with reluctance but to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education makes an honourable connexion impossible and i can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely miss hardcastle aside generous man i now begin to admire him to him but i am sure my family is as good as miss hardcastles and though im poor thats no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment i never thought that it was bad to want fortune marlow and why now my pretty simplicity miss hardcastle because it puts me at a distance from one that if i had a thousand pounds i would give it all to marlow aside this simplicity bewitches me so that if i stay im undone i must make one bold effort and leave her to her your partiality in my favour my dear touches me most sensibly and were i to live for myself alone i could easily fix my choice but i owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so thati can scarcely speak itit affects me farewell exit miss hardcastle i never knew half his merit till now he shall not go if i have power or art to detain him ill still preserve the character in which i stooped to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution exit enter tony and miss neville tony ay you may steal for yourselves the next time i have done my duty she has got the jewels again thats a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants miss neville but my dear cousin sure you wont forsake us in this distress if she in the least suspects that i am going off i shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt pedigrees which is ten times worse tony to be sure aunts of all kinds are damned bad things but what can i do i have got you a pair of horses that will fly like whistlejacket and im sure you cant say but i have courted you nicely before her face here she comes we must court a bit or two more for fear she should suspect us they retire and seem to fondle enter mrs hardcastle mrs hardcastle well i was greatly fluttered to be sure but my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants i shant be easy however till they are fairly married and then let her keep her own fortune but what do i see fondling together as im alive i never saw tony so sprightly before ah have i caught you my pretty doves what billing exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs ah tony as for murmurs mother we grumble a little now and then to be sure but theres no love lost between us mrs hardcastle a mere sprinkling tony upon the flame only to make it burn brighter miss neville cousin tony promises to give us more of his company at home indeed he shant leave us any more it wont leave us cousin tony will it tony o its a pretty creature no id sooner leave my horse in a pound than leave you when you smile upon one so your laugh makes you so becoming miss neville agreeable cousin who can help admiring that natural humour that pleasant broad red thoughtless patting his cheekah its a bold face mrs hardcastle pretty innocence tony im sure i always loved cousin cons hazle eyes and her pretty long fingers that she twists this way and that over the haspicholls like a parcel of bobbins mrs hardcastle ah he would charm the bird from the tree i was never so happy before my boy takes after his father poor mr lumpkin exactly the jewels my dear con shall be yours incontinently you shall have them isnt he a sweet boy my dear you shall be married tomorrow and well put off the rest of his education like dr drowsys sermons to a

hands tony who does it come from diggory your worship mun ask that o the letter itself tony i could wish to know though turning the letter and gazing on it miss neville aside undone undone a letter to

to mr marlow we so laughedyou must know madamthis way a little for he must not hear us they confer tony still gazing a damned cramp piece of penmanship as ever i saw in my life i can read your print hand very well but here are such handles and shanks and dashes that one can scarce tell the head from the tailto anthony lumpkin esquire its very odd i can read the outside of my letters where my own name is well enough but when i come to open it its allbuzz thats hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence mrs hardcastle ha ha ha very well very well and so my son was too hard for the philosopher miss neville yes madam but you must hear the rest madam a little more this way or he may hear us youll hear how he puzzled him again mrs hardcastle he seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks tony still gazing a damned up and down hand as if it was disguised in liquorreading dear siray thats that then theres an m and a t and an s but whether the next be an izzard or an r confound me i cannot tell mrs hardcastle whats that my dear can i give you any assistance miss neville pray aunt let me read it nobody reads a cramp hand better than i twitching

charles and hardcastle hardcastle ha ha ha the peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands sir charles and the reserve with which i suppose he treated all your advances hardcastle and yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper too sir charles yes dick but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper ha ha ha hardcastle well im in too good spirits to think of anything but joy yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and though my daughters fortune is but small sir charles why dick will you talk of fortune to me my son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it if they like each other as you say they do hardcastle if man i tell you they do like each other my daughter as good as told me so sir charles but girls are apt to flatter themselves you know hardcastle i saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your ifs i warrant him enter marlow marlow i come sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct i can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion hardcastle tut boy a trifle you take it too gravely an hour or twos laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again shell never like you the worse for it marlow sir i shall be always

happiness hardcastle come boy im an old fellow and know whats what as well as you that are younger i know what has passed between you but mum marlow sure sir nothing has passed between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on hers you dont think sir that my impudence has been passed upon all the rest of the family hardcastle impudence no i dont say thatnot quite impudencethough girls like to be played with and rumpled a little too sometimes but she has told no tales i assure you marlow i never gave her the slightest cause hardcastle well well i like modesty

dislike you and as im sure you like her marlow dear siri protest sir hardcastle i see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you marlow but hear me sir hardcastle your father approves the match i admire it every moments delay will be doing mischief so marlow but why wont you hear me by all thats just and true i never gave miss hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection we had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting hardcastle aside this fellows formal modest impudence is beyond bearing sir charles and you never grasped her hand or made any protestations marlow as heaven is my witness i came down in obedience to your commands i saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance i hope youll exact no farther proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which i suffer so many mortifications exit sir charles im astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted hardcastle and im astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance sir charles i dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth hardcastle here comes my daughter and i would stake my happiness upon her veracity enter miss hardcastle hardcastle kate come hither child answer us sincerely and without reserve has mr marlow made you any professions of love and affection miss hardcastle the question is very abrupt sir but since you require unreserved sincerity i think he has hardcastle to sir charles you see sir charles and pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview miss hardcastle yes sir several hardcastle to sir charles you see sir charles but did be profess any attachment miss hardcastle a lasting one sir charles did he talk of love miss hardcastle much sir sir charles amazing and all this formally miss hardcastle formally hardcastle now my friend i hope you are satisfied sir charles and how did he behave madam miss hardcastle as most profest admirers do said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture sir charles now im perfectly convinced indeed i know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive this forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and i am confident he never sat for the picture miss hardcastle then what sir if i should convince you to your face of my sincerity if you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person sir charles agreed and if i find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end exit miss hardcastle and if you dont find him what i describei fear my happiness must never have a beginning exeunt scene changes to the back of the garden enter hastings hastings what an idiot am i to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me he never intended to be punctual and ill wait no longer what do i see it is he and perhaps with news of my constance enter tony booted and spattered hastings my honest squire i now find you a man of your word this looks like friendship tony ay im your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all this riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome it has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach hastings but how where did you leave your fellowtravellers are they in safety are they housed tony five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving the poor beasts have smoked for it rabbit me but id rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment hastings well but where have you left the ladies i die with impatience tony left them why where should i leave them but where i found them hastings this is a riddle tony riddle me this then whats that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house hastings im still astray tony why thats it mon i have led them astray by jingo theres not a pond or a slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of hastings ha ha ha i understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward and so you have at last brought them home again tony you shall hear i first took them down featherbed lane where we stuck fast in the mud i then rattled them crack over the stones of upanddown hill i then introduced them to the gibbet on heavytree heath and from that with a circumbendibus i fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden hastings but no accident i hope tony no no only mother is confoundedly frightened she thinks herself forty miles off shes sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl so if your own horses be ready you may whip off with cousin and ill be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you hastings my dear friend how can i be grateful tony ay now its dear friend noble

suffered that i am unable to face any new danger two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness hastings such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy let us fly my charmer let us date our happiness from this very moment perish fortune love and content will increase what we possess beyond a monarchs revenue let me prevail miss neville no mr hastings no prudence once more comes to my relief and i will obey its dictates in the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance im resolved to apply to mr hardcastles compassion and justice for redress hastings but though he had the will he has not the power to relieve you miss neville but he has influence and upon that i am resolved to rely hastings i have no hopes but since you persist i must reluctantly obey you exeunt scene changes enter sir charles and miss hardcastle sir charles what a situation am i in if what you say appears i shall then find a guilty son if what he says be true i shall then lose one that of all others i most wished for a daughter miss hardcastle i am proud of your approbation and to show i merit it if you place yourselves as i directed you shall hear his explicit declaration but he comes sir charles ill to your father and keep him to the appointment exit sir charles enter marlow marlow though prepared for setting out i come once more to take leave nor did i till this moment know the pain i feel in the separation miss hardcastle in her own natural manner i believe sufferings cannot be very great sir which you can so easily remove a day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by showing the little value of what you now think proper to regret marlow aside this girl every moment improves upon me to her it must not be madam i have already trifled too long with my heart my very pride begins to submit to my passion the disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution miss hardcastle then go sir ill urge nothing more to detain you though my family be as good as hers you came down to visit and my education i hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence i must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit i must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune enter hardcastle and sir charles from behind sir charles here behind this screen hardcastle ay ay make no noise ill engage my kate covers him with confusion at last marlow by heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion but every moment that i converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression what at first seemed rustic plainness now appears refined simplicity what seemed forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue sir charles what can it mean he amazes me hardcastle i told you how it would be hush marlow i am now determined to stay madam and i have too good an opinion of my fathers discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation miss hardcastle no mr marlow i will not cannot detain you do you think i could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance do you think i would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion do you think i could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours marlow by all thats good i can have no happiness but whats in your power to grant me nor shall i ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before i will stay even contrary to your wishes and though you should persist to shun me i will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct miss hardcastle sir i must entreat youll desist as our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference i might have given an hour or two to levity but seriously mr marlow do you think i could ever submit to a connexion where i must appear mercenary and you imprudent do you think i could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer marlow kneeling does this look like security does this look like confidence no madam every moment that shows me your merit only serves to increase my diffidence and confusion here let me continue sir charles i can hold it no longer charles charles how hast thou deceived me is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation hardcastle your cold contempt your formal interview what have you to say now marlow that im all amazement what can it mean hardcastle it means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure that you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter marlow daughterthis lady your daughter hardcastle yes sir my only daughter my kate whose else should she be marlow oh the devil miss hardcastle yes sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for courtseying she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha marlow zounds theres no bearing this its worse than death miss hardcastle in which of your characters sir will you give us leave to address you as the faltering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with mrs mantrap and old miss biddy buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha marlow o curse on my noisy head i never attempted to be impudent yet that i was not taken down i must be gone hardcastle by the hand of my body but you shall not i see it was all a mistake and i am rejoiced to find it you shall not sir i tell you i know shell forgive you wont you forgive him kate well

could not have made a more prudent choice hardcastle then by the hand of my body im proud of the connexion mrs hardcastle well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss hardcastle sure dorothy you would not be so mercenary mrs hardcastle ay thats my affair not yours hardcastle but you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal mrs hardcastle ay but hes not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal enter hastings and miss neville mrs hardcastle aside what returned so soon i begin not to like it hastings to hardcastle for my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment we are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity by her fathers consent i first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty miss neville since his death i have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression in an hour of levity i was ready to give up my fortune to secure my choice but i am now recovered from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion mrs hardcastle pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel hardcastle be it what it will im glad theyre come back to reclaim their due come hither tony boy do you refuse this ladys hand whom i now offer you tony what signifies my refusing you know i cant refuse her till im of age father hardcastle while i thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement i concurred with your mothers desire to keep it secret but since i find she turns it to a wrong use i must now declare you have been of age these three months tony of age am i of age father hardcastle above three months tony then youll see the first use ill make of my liberty taking miss nevilles hand witness all men by these presents that i anthony lumpkin esquire of blank place refuse you constantia neville spinster of no place at all for my true and lawful wife so constance neville may marry whom she pleases and tony lumpkin is his own man again sir charles o brave squire hastings my worthy friend mrs hardcastle my undutiful offspring marlow joy my dear george i give you joy sincerely and could i prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary i should be the happiest man alive if you would return me the favour hastings to miss hardcastle come madam you are now driven to the very last scene of all your contrivances i know you like him im sure he loves you and you must and shall have him hardcastle joining their hands and i say so too and mr marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter i dont believe youll ever repent your bargain so now to supper tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistaken in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife exeunt omnes\",\n          \"on a january evening of the early seventies christine nilsson was singing in faust at the academy of music in new york though there was already talk of the erection in remote metropolitan distances above the forties of a new opera house which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great european capitals the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old academy conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient and thus keeping out the new people whom new york was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations and the musical for its excellent acoustics always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music it was madame nilssons first appearance that winter and what the daily press had already learned to describe as an exceptionally brilliant audience had gathered to hear her transported through the slippery snowy streets in private broughams in the spacious family landau or in the humbler but more convenient brown coupe to come to the opera in a brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in ones own carriage and departure by the same means had the immense advantage of enabling one with a playful allusion to democratic principles to scramble into the first brown conveyance in the line instead of waiting till the coldandgin congested nose of ones own coachman gleamed under the portico of the academy it was one of the great liverystablemans most masterly intuitions to have discovered that americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it when newland archer opened the door at the back of the club box the curtain had just gone up on the garden scene there was no reason why the young man should not have come earlier for he had dined at seven alone with his mother and sister and had lingered afterward over a cigar in the gothic library with glazed blackwalnut bookcases and finialtopped chairs which was the only room in the house where mrs archer allowed smoking but in the first place new york was a metropolis and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was not the thing to arrive early at the opera and what was or was not the thing played a part as important in newland archers new york as the inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago the second reason for his delay was a personal one he had dawdled over his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante and thinking over a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its realisation this was especially the case when the pleasure was a delicate one as his pleasures mostly were and on this occasion the moment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality thatwell if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima donnas stagemanager he could not have entered the academy at a more significant moment than just as she was singing he loves mehe loves me nothe loves me and sprinkling the falling daisy petals with notes as clear as dew she sang of course mama and not he loves me since an unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the german text of french operas sung by swedish artists should be translated into italian for the clearer understanding of englishspeaking audiences this seemed as natural to newland archer as all the other conventions on which his life was moulded such as the duty of using two silverbacked brushes with his monogram in blue enamel to part his hair and of never appearing in society without a flower preferably a gardenia in his buttonhole mama non mama the prima donna sang and mama with a final burst of love triumphant as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to her lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of the little brown faustcapoul who was vainly trying in a tight purple velvet doublet and plumed cap to look as pure and true as his artless victim newland archer leaning against the wall at the back of the club box turned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the house directly facing him was the box of old mrs manson mingott whose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to attend the opera but who was always represented on fashionable nights by some of the younger members of the family on this occasion the front of the box was filled by her daughterinlaw mrs lovell mingott and her daughter mrs welland and slightly withdrawn behind these brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically fixed on the stagelovers as madame nilssons mama thrilled out above the silent house the boxes always stopped talking during the daisy song a warm pink mounted to the girls cheek mantled her brow to the roots of her fair braids and suffused the young slope of her breast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a single gardenia she dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of liliesofthevalley on her knee and newland archer saw her whitegloved fingertips touch the flowers softly he drew a breath of satisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage no expense had been spared on the setting which was acknowledged to be very beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the opera houses of paris and vienna the foreground to the footlights was covered with emerald green cloth in the middle distance symmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed the base of shrubs shaped like orangetrees but studded with large pink and red roses gigantic pansies considerably larger than the roses and closely resembling the floral penwipers made by female parishioners for fashionable clergymen sprang from the moss beneath the rosetrees and here and there a daisy grafted on a rosebranch flowered with a luxuriance prophetic of mr luther burbanks faroff prodigies in the centre of this enchanted garden madame nilsson in white cashmere slashed with pale blue satin a reticule dangling from a blue girdle and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her muslin chemisette listened with downcast eyes to m capouls impassioned wooing and affected a guileless incomprehension of his designs whenever by word or glance he persuasively indicated the ground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from the right wing the darling thought newland archer his glance flitting back to the young girl with the liliesofthevalley she doesnt even guess what its all about and he contemplated her absorbed young face with a thrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation was mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity well read faust together by the italian lakes he thought somewhat hazily confusing the scene of his projected honeymoon with the masterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to reveal to his bride it was only that afternoon that may welland had let him guess that she cared new yorks consecrated phrase of maiden avowal and already his imagination leaping ahead of the engagement ring the betrothal kiss and the march from lohengrin pictured her at his side in some scene of old european witchery he did not in the least wish the future mrs newland archer to be a simpleton he meant her thanks to his enlightening companionship to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the younger set in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it if he had probed to the bottom of his vanity as he sometimes nearly did he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as worldlywise and as eager to please as the married lady whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years without of course any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred that unhappy beings life and had disarranged his own plans for a whole winter how this miracle of fire and ice was to be created and to sustain itself in a harsh world he had never taken the time to think out but he was content to hold his view without analysing it since he knew it was that of all the carefullybrushed whitewaistcoated buttonholeflowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box exchanged friendly greetings with him and turned their operaglasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product of the system in matters intellectual and artistic newland archer felt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old new york gentility he had probably read more thought more and even seen a good deal more of the world than any other man of the number singly they betrayed their inferiority but grouped together they represented new york and the habit of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral he instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesomeand also rather bad formto strike out for himself wellupon my soul exclaimed lawrence lefferts turning his operaglass abruptly away from the stage lawrence lefferts was on the whole the foremost authority on form in new york he had probably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this intricate and fascinating question but study alone could not account for his complete and easy competence one had only to look at him from the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair moustache to the long patentleather feet at the other end of his lean and elegant person to feel that the knowledge of form must be congenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so carelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace as a young admirer had once said of him if anybody can tell a fellow just when to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to its larry lefferts and on the question of pumps versus patentleather oxfords his authority had never been disputed my god he said and silently handed his glass to old sillerton jackson newland archer following leffertss glance saw with surprise that his exclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old mrs mingotts box it was that of a slim young woman a little less tall than may welland with brown hair growing in close curls about her temples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds the suggestion of this headdress which gave her what was then called a josephine look was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather theatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large oldfashioned clasp the wearer of this unusual dress who seemed quite unconscious of the attention it was attracting stood a moment in the centre of the box discussing with mrs welland the propriety of taking the latters place in the front righthand corner then she yielded with a slight smile and seated herself in line with mrs wellands sisterinlaw mrs lovell mingott who was installed in the opposite corner mr sillerton jackson had returned the operaglass to lawrence lefferts the whole of the club turned instinctively waiting to hear what the old man had to say for old mr jackson was as great an authority on family as lawrence lefferts was on form he knew all the ramifications of new yorks cousinships and could not only elucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between the mingotts through the thorleys with the dallases of south carolina and that of the relationship of the elder branch of philadelphia thorleys to the albany chiverses on no account to be confused with the manson chiverses of university place but could also enumerate the leading characteristics of each family as for instance the fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of leffertses the long island ones or the fatal tendency of the rushworths to make foolish matches or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the albany chiverses with whom their new york cousins had always refused to intermarrywith the disastrous exception of poor medora manson who as everybody knew but then her mother was a rushworth in addition to this forest of family trees mr sillerton jackson carried between his narrow hollow temples and under his soft thatch of silver hair a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had smouldered under the unruffled surface of new york society within the last fifty years so far indeed did his information extend and so acutely retentive was his memory that he was supposed to be the only man who could have told you who julius beaufort the banker really was and what had become of handsome bob spicer old mrs manson mingotts father who had disappeared so mysteriously with a large sum of trust money less than a year after his marriage on the very day that a beautiful spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged audiences in the old operahouse on the battery had taken ship for cuba but these mysteries and many others were closely locked in mr jacksons breast for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his repeating anything privately imparted but he was fully aware that his reputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out what he wanted to know the club box therefore waited in visible suspense while mr sillerton jackson handed back lawrence leffertss operaglass for a moment he silently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes overhung by old veined lids then he gave his moustache a thoughtful twist and said simply i didnt think the mingotts would have tried it on newland archer during this brief episode had been thrown into a strange state of embarrassment it was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided attention of masculine new york should be that in which his betrothed was seated between her mother and aunt and for a moment he could not identify the lady in the empire dress nor imagine why her presence created such excitement among the initiated then light dawned on him and with it came a momentary rush of indignation no indeed no one would have thought the mingotts would have tried it on but they had they undoubtedly had for the lowtoned comments behind him left no doubt in archers mind that the young woman was may wellands cousin the cousin always referred to in the family as poor ellen olenska archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from europe a day or two previously he had even heard from miss welland not disapprovingly that she had been to see poor ellen who was staying with old mrs mingott archer entirely approved of family solidarity and one of the qualities he most admired in the mingotts was their resolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock had produced there was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young mans heart and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by false prudery from being kind in private to her unhappy cousin but to receive countess olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public at the opera of all places and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him newland archer was to be announced within a few weeks no he felt as old sillerton jackson felt he did not think the mingotts would have tried it on he knew of course that whatever man dared within fifth avenues limits that old mrs manson mingott the matriarch of the line would dare he had always admired the high and mighty old lady who in spite of having been only catherine spicer of staten island with a father mysteriously discredited and neither money nor position enough to make people forget it had allied herself with the head of the wealthy mingott line married two of her daughters to foreigners an italian marquis and an english banker and put the crowning touch to her audacities by building a large house of pale creamcoloured stone when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frockcoat in the afternoon in an inaccessible wilderness near the central park old mrs mingotts foreign daughters had become a legend they never came back to see their mother and the latter being like many persons of active mind and dominating will sedentary and corpulent in her habit had philosophically remained at home but the creamcoloured house supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the parisian aristocracy was there as a visible proof of her moral courage and she throned in it among prerevolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the tuileries of louis napoleon where she had shone in her middle age as placidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above thirtyfourth street or in having french windows that opened like doors instead of sashes that pushed up every one including mr sillerton jackson was agreed that old catherine had never had beautya gift which in the eyes of new york justified every success and excused a certain number of failings unkind people said that like her imperial namesake she had won her way to success by strength of will and hardness of heart and a kind of haughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency and dignity of her private life mr manson mingott had died when she was only twentyeight and had tied up the money with an additional caution born of the general distrust of the spicers but his bold young widow went her way fearlessly mingled freely in foreign society married her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable circles hobnobbed with dukes and ambassadors associated familiarly with papists entertained opera singers and was the intimate friend of mme taglioni and all the while as sillerton jackson was the first to proclaim there had never been a breath on her reputation the only respect he always added in which she differed from the earlier catherine mrs manson mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husbands fortune and had lived in affluence for half a century but memories of her early straits had made her excessively thrifty and though when she bought a dress or a piece of furniture she took care that it should be of the best she could not bring herself to spend much on the transient pleasures of the table therefore for totally different reasons her food was as poor as mrs archers and her wines did nothing to redeem it her relatives considered that the penury of her table discredited the mingott name which had always been associated with good living but people continued to come to her in spite of the made dishes and flat champagne and in reply to the remonstrances of her son lovell who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the best chef in new york she used to say laughingly whats the use of two good cooks in one family now that ive married the girls and cant eat sauces newland archer as he mused on these things had once more turned his eyes toward the mingott box he saw that mrs welland and her sisterinlaw were facing their semicircle of critics with the mingottian aplomb which old catherine had inculcated in all her tribe and that only may welland betrayed by a heightened colour perhaps due to the knowledge that he was watching her a sense of the gravity of the situation as for the cause of the commotion she sat gracefully in her corner of the box her eyes fixed on the stage and revealing as she leaned forward a little more shoulder and bosom than new york was accustomed to seeing at least in ladies who had reasons for wishing to pass unnoticed few things seemed to newland archer more awful than an offence against taste that faroff divinity of whom form was the mere visible representative and vicegerent madame olenskas pale and serious face appealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy situation but the way her dress which had no tucker sloped away from her thin shoulders shocked and troubled him he hated to think of may wellands being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless of the dictates of taste after all he heard one of the younger men begin behind him everybody talked through the mephistophelesandmartha scenes after all just what happened wellshe left him nobody attempts to deny that hes an awful brute isnt he continued the young enquirer a candid thorley who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the ladys champion the very worst i knew him at nice said lawrence lefferts with authority a halfparalysed white sneering fellowrather handsome head but eyes with a lot of lashes well ill tell you the sort when he wasnt with women he was collecting china paying any price for both i understand there was a general laugh and the young champion said well then well then she bolted with his secretary oh i see the champions face fell it didnt last long though i heard of her a few months later living alone in venice i believe lovell mingott went out to get her he said she was desperately unhappy thats all rightbut this parading her at the operas another thing perhaps young thorley hazarded shes too unhappy to be left at home this was greeted with an irreverent laugh and the youth blushed deeply and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowing people called a double entendre wellits queer to have brought miss welland anyhow some one said in a low tone with a sideglance at archer oh thats part of the campaign grannys orders no doubt lefferts laughed when the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly the act was ending and there was a general stir in the box suddenly newland archer felt himself impelled to decisive action the desire to be the first man to enter mrs mingotts box to proclaim to the waiting world his engagement to may welland and to see her through whatever difficulties her cousins anomalous situation might involve her in this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples and hesitations and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to the farther side of the house as he entered the box his eyes met miss wellands and he saw that she had instantly understood his motive though the family dignity which both considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so the persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications and pale delicacies and the fact that he and she understood each other without a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than any explanation would have done her eyes said you see why mamma brought me and his answered i would not for the world have had you stay away you know my niece countess olenska mrs welland enquired as she shook hands with her future soninlaw archer bowed without extending his hand as was the custom on being introduced to a lady and ellen olenska bent her head slightly keeping her own palegloved hands clasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers having greeted mrs lovell mingott a large blonde lady in creaking satin he sat down beside his betrothed and said in a low tone i hope youve told madame olenska that were engaged i want everybody to knowi want you to let me announce it this evening at the ball miss wellands face grew rosy as the dawn and she looked at him with radiant eyes if you can persuade mamma she said but why should we change what is already settled he made no answer but that which his eyes returned and she added still more confidently smiling tell my cousin yourself i give you leave she says she used to play with you when you were children she made way for him by pushing back her chair and promptly and a little ostentatiously with the desire that the whole house should see what he was doing archer seated himself at the countess olenskas side we did use to play together didnt we she asked turning her grave eyes to his you were a horrid boy and kissed me once behind a door but it was your cousin vandie newland who never looked at me that i was in love with her glance swept the horseshoe curve of boxes ah how this brings it all back to mei see everybody here in knickerbockers and pantalettes she said with her trailing slightly foreign accent her eyes returning to his face agreeable as their expression was the young man was shocked that they should reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal before which at that very moment her case was being tried nothing could be in worse taste than misplaced flippancy and he answered somewhat stiffly yes you have been away a very long time oh centuries and centuries so long she said that im sure im dead and buried and this dear old place is heaven which for reasons he could not define struck newland archer as an even more disrespectful way of describing new york society it invariably happened in the same way mrs julius beaufort on the night of her annual ball never failed to appear at the opera indeed she always gave her ball on an opera night in order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares and her possession of a staff of servants competent to organise every detail of the entertainment in her absence the beauforts house was one of the few in new york that possessed a ballroom it antedated even mrs manson mingotts and the headly chiverses and at a time when it was beginning to be thought provincial to put a crash over the drawingroom floor and move the furniture upstairs the possession of a ballroom that was used for no other purpose and left for threehundredandsixtyfour days of the year to shuttered darkness with its gilt chairs stacked in a corner and its chandelier in a bag this undoubted superiority was felt to compensate for whatever was regrettable in the beaufort past mrs archer who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms had once said we all have our pet common people and though the phrase was a daring one its truth was secretly admitted in many an exclusive bosom but the beauforts were not exactly common some people said they were even worse mrs beaufort belonged indeed to one of americas most honoured families she had been the lovely regina dallas of the south carolina branch a penniless beauty introduced to new york society by her cousin the imprudent medora manson who was always doing the wrong thing from the right motive when one was related to the mansons and the rushworths one had a droit de cite as mr sillerton jackson who had frequented the tuileries called it in new york society but did one not forfeit it in marrying julius beaufort the question was who was beaufort he passed for an englishman was agreeable handsome illtempered hospitable and witty he had come to america with letters of recommendation from old mrs manson mingotts english soninlaw the banker and had speedily made himself an important position in the world of affairs but his habits were dissipated his tongue was bitter his antecedents were mysterious and when medora manson announced her cousins engagement to him it was felt to be one more act of folly in poor medoras long record of imprudences but folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom and two years after young mrs beauforts marriage it was admitted that she had the most distinguished house in new york no one knew exactly how the miracle was accomplished she was indolent passive the caustic even called her dull but dressed like an idol hung with pearls growing younger and blonder and more beautiful each year she throned in mr beauforts heavy brownstone palace and drew all the world there without lifting her jewelled little finger the knowing people said it was beaufort himself who trained the servants taught the chef new dishes told the gardeners what hothouse flowers to grow for the dinnertable and the drawingrooms selected the guests brewed the afterdinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her friends if he did these domestic activities were privately performed and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawingroom with the detachment of an invited guest and saying my wifes gloxinias are a marvel arent they i believe she gets them out from kew mr beauforts secret people were agreed was the way he carried things off it was all very well to whisper that he had been helped to leave england by the international bankinghouse in which he had been employed he carried off that rumour as easily as the restthough new yorks business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral standardhe carried everything before him and all new york into his drawingrooms and for over twenty years now people had said they were going to the beauforts with the same tone of security as if they had said they were going to mrs manson mingotts and with the added satisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvasback ducks and vintage wines instead of tepid veuve clicquot without a year and warmedup croquettes from philadelphia mrs beaufort then had as usual appeared in her box just before the jewel song and when again as usual she rose at the end of the third act drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders and disappeared new york knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin the beaufort house was one that new yorkers were proud to show to foreigners especially on the night of the annual ball the beauforts had been among the first people in new york to own their own red velvet carpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen under their own awning instead of hiring it with the supper and the ballroom chairs they had also inaugurated the custom of letting the ladies take their cloaks off in the hall instead of shuffling up to the hostesss bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the gasburner beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all his wifes friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly coiffees when they left home then the house had been boldly planned with a ballroom so that instead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it as at the chiverses one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed drawingrooms the seagreen the crimson and the bouton dor seeing from afar the manycandled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry and beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and treeferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold bamboo newland archer as became a young man of his position strolled in somewhat late he had left his overcoat with the silkstockinged footmen the stockings were one of beauforts few fatuities had dawdled a while in the library hung with spanish leather and furnished with buhl and malachite where a few men were chatting and putting on their dancinggloves and had finally joined the line of guests whom mrs beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson drawingroom archer was distinctly nervous he had not gone back to his club after the opera as the young bloods usually did but the night being fine had walked for some distance up fifth avenue before turning back in the direction of the beauforts house he was definitely afraid that the mingotts might be going too far that in fact they might have granny mingotts orders to bring the countess olenska to the ball from the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that would be and though he was more than ever determined to see the thing through he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his betrotheds cousin than before their brief talk at the opera wandering on to the bouton dor drawingroom where beaufort had had the audacity to hang love victorious the muchdiscussed nude of bouguereau archer found mrs welland and her daughter standing near the ballroom door couples were already gliding over the floor beyond the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts on girlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms on the dashing aigrettes and ornaments of the young married womens coiffures and on the glitter of highly glazed shirtfronts and fresh glace gloves miss welland evidently about to join the dancers hung on the threshold her liliesofthevalley in her hand she carried no other bouquet her face a little pale her eyes burning with a candid excitement a group of young men and girls were gathered about her and there was much handclasping laughing and pleasantry on which mrs welland standing slightly apart shed the beam of a qualified approval it was evident that miss welland was in the act of announcing her engagement while her mother affected the air of parental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion archer paused a moment it was at his express wish that the announcement had been made and yet it was not thus that he would have wished to have his happiness known to proclaim it in the heat and noise of a crowded ballroom was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy which should belong to things nearest the heart his joy was so deep that this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched but he would have liked to keep the surface pure too it was something of a satisfaction to find that may welland shared this feeling her eyes fled to his beseechingly and their look said remember were doing this because its right no appeal could have found a more immediate response in archers breast but he wished that the necessity of their action had been represented by some ideal reason and not simply by poor ellen olenska the group about miss welland made way for him with significant smiles and after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed into the middle of the ballroom floor and put his arm about her waist now we shant have to talk he said smiling into her candid eyes as they floated away on the soft waves of the blue danube she made no answer her lips trembled into a smile but the eyes remained distant and serious as if bent on some ineffable vision dear archer whispered pressing her to him it was borne in on him that the first hours of being engaged even if spent in a ballroom had in them something grave and sacramental what a new life it was going to be with this whiteness radiance goodness at ones side the dance over the two as became an affianced couple wandered into the conservatory and sitting behind a tall screen of treeferns and camellias newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips you see i did as you asked me to she said yes i couldnt wait he answered smiling after a moment he added only i wish it hadnt had to be at a ball yes i know she met his glance comprehendingly but after alleven here were alone together arent we oh dearestalways archer cried evidently she was always going to understand she was always going to say the right thing the discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow and he went on gaily the worst of it is that i want to kiss you and i cant as he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory assured himself of their momentary privacy and catching her to him laid a fugitive pressure on her lips to counteract the audacity of this proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of the conservatory and sitting down beside her broke a lilyofthevalley from her bouquet she sat silent and the world lay like a sunlit valley at their feet did you tell my cousin ellen she asked presently as if she spoke through a dream he roused himself and remembered that he had not done so some invincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign woman had checked the words on his lips noi hadnt the chance after all he said fibbing hastily ah she looked disappointed but gently resolved on gaining her point you must then for i didnt either and i shouldnt like her to think of course not but arent you after all the person to do it she pondered on this if id done it at the right time yes but now that theres been a delay i think you must explain that id asked you to tell her at the opera before our speaking about it to everybody here otherwise she might think i had forgotten her you see shes one of the family and shes been away so long that shes rathersensitive archer looked at her glowingly dear and great angel of course ill tell her he glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded ballroom but i havent seen her yet has she come no at the last minute she decided not to at the last minute he echoed betraying his surprise that she should ever have considered the alternative possible yes shes awfully fond of dancing the young girl answered simply but suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasnt smart enough for a ball though we thought it so lovely and so my aunt had to take her home oh well said archer with happy indifference nothing about his betrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to its utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the unpleasant in which they had both been brought up she knows as well as i do he reflected the real reason of her cousins staying away but i shall never let her see by the least sign that i am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor ellen olenskas reputation in the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits were exchanged the new york ritual was precise and inflexible in such matters and in conformity with it newland archer first went with his mother and sister to call on mrs welland after which he and mrs welland and may drove out to old mrs manson mingotts to receive that venerable ancestresss blessing a visit to mrs manson mingott was always an amusing episode to the young man the house in itself was already an historic document though not of course as venerable as certain other old family houses in university place and lower fifth avenue those were of the purest 1830 with a grim harmony of cabbagerosegarlanded carpets rosewood consoles roundarched fireplaces with black marble mantels and immense glazed bookcases of mahogany whereas old mrs mingott who had built her house later had bodily cast out the massive furniture of her prime and mingled with the mingott heirlooms the frivolous upholstery of the second empire it was her habit to sit in a window of her sittingroom on the ground floor as if watching calmly for life and fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors she seemed in no hurry to have them come for her patience was equalled by her confidence she was sure that presently the hoardings the quarries the onestory saloons the wooden greenhouses in ragged gardens and the rocks from which goats surveyed the scene would vanish before the advance of residences as stately as her ownperhaps for she was an impartial woman even statelier and that the cobblestones over which the old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth asphalt such as people reported having seen in paris meanwhile as every one she cared to see came to her and she could fill her rooms as easily as the beauforts and without adding a single item to the menu of her suppers she did not suffer from her geographic isolation the immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle life like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump active little woman with a neatlyturned foot and ankle into something as vast and august as a natural phenomenon she had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials and now in extreme old age was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh in the centre of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation a flight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a stillsnowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a miniature portrait of the late mr mingott and around and below wave after wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious armchair with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of the billows the burden of mrs manson mingotts flesh had long since made it impossible for her to go up and down stairs and with characteristic independence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established herself in flagrant violation of all the new york proprieties on the ground floor of her house so that as you sat in her sittingroom window with her you caught through a door that was always open and a loopedback yellow damask portiere the unexpected vista of a bedroom with a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa and a toilettable with frivolous lace flounces and a giltframed mirror her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this arrangement which recalled scenes in french fiction and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple american had never dreamed of that was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies in apartments with all the rooms on one floor and all the indecent propinquities that their novels described it amused newland archer who had secretly situated the lovescenes of monsieur de camors in mrs mingotts bedroom to picture her blameless life led in the stagesetting of adultery but he said to himself with considerable admiration that if a lover had been what she wanted the intrepid woman would have had him too to the general relief the countess olenska was not present in her grandmothers drawingroom during the visit of the betrothed couple mrs mingott said she had gone out which on a day of such glaring sunlight and at the shopping hour seemed in itself an indelicate thing for a compromised woman to do but at any rate it spared them the embarrassment of her presence and the faint shadow that her unhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future the visit went off successfully as was to have been expected old mrs mingott was delighted with the engagement which being long foreseen by watchful relatives had been carefully passed upon in family council and the engagement ring a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws met with her unqualified admiration its the new setting of course it shows the stone beautifully but it looks a little bare to oldfashioned eyes mrs welland had explained with a conciliatory sideglance at her future soninlaw oldfashioned eyes i hope you dont mean mine my dear i like all the novelties said the ancestress lifting the stone to her small bright orbs which no glasses had ever disfigured very handsome she added returning the jewel very liberal in my time a cameo set in pearls was thought sufficient but its the hand that sets off the ring isnt it my dear mr archer and she waved one of her tiny hands with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the wrist like ivory bracelets mine was modelled in rome by the great ferrigiani you should have mays done no doubt hell have it done my child her hand is largeits these modern sports that spread the jointsbut the skin is whiteand whens the wedding to be she broke off fixing her eyes on archers face oh mrs welland murmured while the young man smiling at his betrothed replied as soon as ever it can if only youll back me up mrs mingott we must give them time to get to know each other a little better mamma mrs welland interposed with the proper affectation of reluctance to which the ancestress rejoined know each other fiddlesticks everybody in new york has always known everybody let the young man have his way my dear dont wait till the bubbles off the wine marry them before lent i may catch pneumonia any winter now and i want to give the weddingbreakfast these successive statements were received with the proper expressions of amusement incredulity and gratitude and the visit was breaking up in a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the countess olenska who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected figure of julius beaufort there was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies and mrs mingott held out ferrigianis model to the banker ha beaufort this is a rare favour she had an odd foreign way of addressing men by their surnames thanks i wish it might happen oftener said the visitor in his easy arrogant way im generally so tied down but i met the countess ellen in madison square and she was good enough to let me walk home with her ahi hope the house will be gayer now that ellens here cried mrs mingott with a glorious effrontery sit downsit down beaufort push up the yellow armchair now ive got you i want a good gossip i hear your ball was magnificent and i understand you invited mrs lemuel struthers wellive a curiosity to see the woman myself she had forgotten her relatives who were drifting out into the hall under ellen olenskas guidance old mrs mingott had always professed a great admiration for julius beaufort and there was a kind of kinship in their cool domineering way and their shortcuts through the conventions now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the beauforts to invite for the first time mrs lemuel struthers the widow of strutherss shoepolish who had returned the previous year from a long initiatory sojourn in europe to lay siege to the tight little citadel of new york of course if you and regina invite her the thing is settled well we need new blood and new moneyand i hear shes still very goodlooking the carnivorous old lady declared in the hall while mrs welland and may drew on their furs archer saw that the countess olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning smile of course you know alreadyabout may and me he said answering her look with a shy laugh she scolded me for not giving you the news last night at the opera i had her orders to tell you that we were engagedbut i couldnt in that crowd the smile passed from countess olenskas eyes to her lips she looked younger more like the bold brown ellen mingott of his boyhood of course i know yes and im so glad but one doesnt tell such things first in a crowd the ladies were on the threshold and she held out her hand goodbye come and see me some day she said still looking at archer in the carriage on the way down fifth avenue they talked pointedly of mrs mingott of her age her spirit and all her wonderful attributes no one alluded to ellen olenska but archer knew that mrs welland was thinking its a mistake for ellen to be seen the very day after her arrival parading up fifth avenue at the crowded hour with julius beaufort and the young man himself mentally added and she ought to know that a man whos just engaged doesnt spend his time calling on married women but i daresay in the set shes lived in they dothey never do anything else and in spite of the cosmopolitan views on which he prided himself he thanked heaven that he was a new yorker and about to ally himself with one of his own kind the next evening old mr sillerton jackson came to dine with the archers mrs archer was a shy woman and shrank from society but she liked to be wellinformed as to its doings her old friend mr sillerton jackson applied to the investigation of his friends affairs the patience of a collector and the science of a naturalist and his sister miss sophy jackson who lived with him and was entertained by all the people who could not secure her muchsoughtafter brother brought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in his picture therefore whenever anything happened that mrs archer wanted to know about she asked mr jackson to dine and as she honoured few people with her invitations and as she and her daughter janey were an excellent audience mr jackson usually came himself instead of sending his sister if he could have dictated all the conditions he would have chosen the evenings when newland was out not because the young man was uncongenial to him the two got on capitally at their club but because the old anecdotist sometimes felt on newlands part a tendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never showed mr jackson if perfection had been attainable on earth would also have asked that mrs archers food should be a little better but then new york as far back as the mind of man could travel had been divided into the two great fundamental groups of the mingotts and mansons and all their clan who cared about eating and clothes and money and the archernewlandvanderluyden tribe who were devoted to travel horticulture and the best fiction and looked down on the grosser forms of pleasure you couldnt have everything after all if you dined with the lovell mingotts you got canvasback and terrapin and vintage wines at adeline archers you could talk about alpine scenery and the marble faun and luckily the archer madeira had gone round the cape therefore when a friendly summons came from mrs archer mr jackson who was a true eclectic would usually say to his sister ive been a little gouty since my last dinner at the lovell mingottsit will do me good to diet at adelines mrs archer who had long been a widow lived with her son and daughter in west twentyeighth street an upper floor was dedicated to newland and the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below in an unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in wardian cases made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen collected american revolutionary glazed ware subscribed to good words and read ouidas novels for the sake of the italian atmosphere they preferred those about peasant life because of the descriptions of scenery and the pleasanter sentiments though in general they liked novels about people in society whose motives and habits were more comprehensible spoke severely of dickens who had never drawn a gentleman and considered thackeray less at home in the great world than bulwerwho however was beginning to be thought oldfashioned mrs and miss archer were both great lovers of scenery it was what they principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad considering architecture and painting as subjects for men and chiefly for learned persons who read ruskin mrs archer had been born a newland and mother and daughter who were as like as sisters were both as people said true newlands tall pale and slightly roundshouldered with long noses sweet smiles and a kind of drooping distinction like that in certain faded reynolds portraits their physical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint had not stretched mrs archers black brocade while miss archers brown and purple poplins hung as the years went on more and more slackly on her virgin frame mentally the likeness between them as newland was aware was less complete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear the long habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given them the same vocabulary and the same habit of beginning their phrases mother thinks or janey thinks according as one or the other wished to advance an opinion of her own but in reality while mrs archers serene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar janey was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from springs of suppressed romance mother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and brother and archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and uncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration and by his secret satisfaction in it after all he thought it a good thing for a man to have his authority respected in his own house even if his sense of humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate on this occasion the young man was very sure that mr jackson would rather have had him dine out but he had his own reasons for not doing so of course old jackson wanted to talk about ellen olenska and of course mrs archer and janey wanted to hear what he had to tell all three would be slightly embarrassed by newlands presence now that his prospective relation to the mingott clan had been made known and the young man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn the difficulty they began obliquely by talking about mrs lemuel struthers its a pity the beauforts asked her mrs archer said gently but then regina always does what he tells her and beaufort certain nuances escape beaufort said mr jackson cautiously inspecting the broiled shad and wondering for the thousandth time why mrs archers cook always burnt the roe to a cinder newland who had long shared his wonder could always detect it in the older mans expression of melancholy disapproval oh necessarily beaufort is a vulgar man said mrs archer my grandfather newland always used to say to my mother whatever you do dont let that fellow beaufort be introduced to the girls but at least hes had the advantage of associating with gentlemen in england too they say its all very mysterious she glanced at janey and paused she and janey knew every fold of the beaufort mystery but in public mrs archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for the unmarried but this mrs struthers mrs archer continued what did you say she was sillerton out of a mine or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit then with living waxworks touring new england after the police broke that up they say she lived mr jackson in his turn glanced at janey whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids there were still hiatuses for her in mrs strutherss past then mr jackson continued and archer saw he was wondering why no one had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife then lemuel struthers came along they say his advertiser used the girls head for the shoepolish posters her hairs intensely black you knowthe egyptian style anyhow heeventuallymarried her there were volumes of innuendo in the way the eventually was spaced and each syllable given its due stress oh wellat the pass weve come to nowadays it doesnt matter said mrs archer indifferently the ladies were not really interested in mrs struthers just then the subject of ellen olenska was too fresh and too absorbing to them indeed mrs strutherss name had been introduced by mrs archer only that she might presently be able to say and newlands new cousincountess olenska was she at the ball too there was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son and archer knew it and had expected it even mrs archer who was seldom unduly pleased with human events had been altogether glad of her sons engagement especially after that silly business with mrs rushworth as she had remarked to janey alluding to what had once seemed to newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the scar there was no better match in new york than may welland look at the question from whatever point you chose of course such a marriage was only what newland was entitled to but young men are so foolish and incalculableand some women so ensnaring and unscrupulousthat it was nothing short of a miracle to see ones only son safe past the siren isle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity all this mrs archer felt and her son knew she felt but he knew also that she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his engagement or rather by its cause and it was for that reasonbecause on the whole he was a tender and indulgent masterthat he had stayed at home that evening its not that i dont approve of the mingotts esprit de corps but why newlands engagement should be mixed up with that olenska womans comings and goings i dont see mrs archer grumbled to janey the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect sweetness she had behaved beautifullyand in beautiful behaviour she was unsurpassedduring the call on mrs welland but newland knew and his betrothed doubtless guessed that all through the visit she and janey were nervously on the watch for madame olenskas possible intrusion and when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say to her son im thankful that augusta welland received us alone these indications of inward disturbance moved archer the more that he too felt that the mingotts had gone a little too far but as it was against all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts he simply replied oh well theres always a phase of family parties to be gone through when one gets engaged and the sooner its over the better at which his mother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from her grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes her revenge he felther lawful revengewould be to draw mr jackson that evening on the countess olenska and having publicly done his duty as a future member of the mingott clan the young man had no objection to hearing the lady discussed in privateexcept that the subject was already beginning to bore him mr jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the mournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own and had rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff he looked baffled and hungry and archer reflected that he would probably finish his meal on ellen olenska mr jackson leaned back in his chair and glanced up at the candlelit archers newlands and van der luydens hanging in dark frames on the dark walls ah how your grandfather archer loved a good dinner my dear newland he said his eyes on the portrait of a plump fullchested young man in a stock and a blue coat with a view of a whitecolumned countryhouse behind him wellwellwell i wonder what he would have said to all these foreign marriages mrs archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and mr jackson continued with deliberation no she was not at the ball ah mrs archer murmured in a tone that implied she had that decency perhaps the beauforts dont know her janey suggested with her artless malice mr jackson gave a faint sip as if he had been tasting invisible madeira mrs beaufort may notbut beaufort certainly does for she was seen walking up fifth avenue this afternoon with him by the whole of new york mercy moaned mrs archer evidently perceiving the uselessness of trying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy i wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon janey speculated at the opera i know she had on dark blue velvet perfectly plain and flatlike a nightgown janey said her mother and miss archer blushed and tried to look audacious it was at any rate in better taste not to go to the ball mrs archer continued a spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin i dont think it was a question of taste with her may said she meant to go and then decided that the dress in question wasnt smart enough mrs archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference poor ellen she simply remarked adding compassionately we must always bear in mind what an eccentric bringingup medora manson gave her what can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her comingout ball ahdont i remember her in it said mr jackson adding poor girl in the tone of one who while enjoying the memory had fully understood at the time what the sight portended its odd janey remarked that she should have kept such an ugly name as ellen i should have changed it to elaine she glanced about the table to see the effect of this her brother laughed why elaine i dont know it sounds moremore polish said janey blushing it sounds more conspicuous and that can hardly be what she wishes said mrs archer distantly why not broke in her son growing suddenly argumentative why shouldnt she be conspicuous if she chooses why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself shes poor ellen certainly because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage but i dont see that thats a reason for hiding her head as if she were the culprit that i suppose said mr jackson speculatively is the line the mingotts mean to take the young man reddened i didnt have to wait for their cue if thats what you mean sir madame olenska has had an unhappy life that doesnt make her an outcast there are rumours began mr jackson glancing at janey oh i know the secretary the young man took him up nonsense mother janeys grownup they say dont they he went on that the secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband who kept her practically a prisoner well what if he did i hope there isnt a man among us who wouldnt have done the same in such a case mr jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler perhaps that sauce just a little after all then having helped himself he remarked im told shes looking for a house she means to live here i hear she means to get a divorce said janey boldly i hope she will archer exclaimed the word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil atmosphere of the archer diningroom mrs archer raised her delicate eyebrows in the particular curve that signified the butler and the young man himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such intimate matters in public hastily branched off into an account of his visit to old mrs mingott after dinner according to immemorial custom mrs archer and janey trailed their long silk draperies up to the drawingroom where while the gentlemen smoked below stairs they sat beside a carcel lamp with an engraved globe facing each other across a rosewood worktable with a green silk bag under it and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry band of fieldflowers destined to adorn an occasional chair in the drawingroom of young mrs newland archer while this rite was in progress in the drawingroom archer settled mr jackson in an armchair near the fire in the gothic library and handed him a cigar mr jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction lit his cigar with perfect confidence it was newland who bought them and stretching his thin old ankles to the coals said you say the secretary merely helped her to get away my dear fellow well he was still helping her a year later then for somebody met em living at lausanne together newland reddened living together well why not who had the right to make her life over if she hadnt im sick of the hypocrisy that would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with harlots he stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar women ought to be freeas free as we are he declared making a discovery of which he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences mr sillerton jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted a sardonic whistle well he said after a pause apparently count olenski takes your view for i never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife back that evening after mr jackson had taken himself away and the ladies had retired to their chintzcurtained bedroom newland archer mounted thoughtfully to his own study a vigilant hand had as usual kept the fire alive and the lamp trimmed and the room with its rows and rows of books its bronze and steel statuettes of the fencers on the mantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures looked singularly homelike and welcoming as he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a large photograph of may welland which the young girl had given him in the first days of their romance and which had now displaced all the other portraits on the table with a new sense of awe he looked at the frank forehead serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young creature whose souls custodian he was to be that terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything looked back at him like a stranger through may wellands familiar features and once more it was borne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been taught to think but a voyage on uncharted seas the case of the countess olenska had stirred up old settled convictions and set them drifting dangerously through his mind his own exclamation women should be freeas free as we are struck to the root of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as nonexistent nice women however wronged would never claim the kind of freedom he meant and generousminded men like himself were thereforein the heat of argumentthe more chivalrously ready to concede it to them such verbal generosities were in fact only a humbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things together and bound people down to the old pattern but here he was pledged to defend on the part of his betrotheds cousin conduct that on his own wifes part would justify him in calling down on her all the thunders of church and state of course the dilemma was purely hypothetical since he wasnt a blackguard polish nobleman it was absurd to speculate what his wifes rights would be if he were but newland archer was too imaginative not to feel that in his case and mays the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable what could he and she really know of each other since it was his duty as a decent fellow to conceal his past from her and hers as a marriageable girl to have no past to conceal what if for some one of the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them they should tire of each other misunderstand or irritate each other he reviewed his friends marriagesthe supposedly happy onesand saw none that answered even remotely to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with may welland he perceived that such a picture presupposed on her part the experience the versatility the freedom of judgment which she had been carefully trained not to possess and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other lawrence lefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely realised this enviable ideal as became the highpriest of form he had formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that in the most conspicuous moments of his frequent loveaffairs with other mens wives she went about in smiling unconsciousness saying that lawrence was so frightfully strict and had been known to blush indignantly and avert her gaze when some one alluded in her presence to the fact that julius beaufort as became a foreigner of doubtful origin had what was known in new york as another establishment archer tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite such an ass as larry lefferts nor may such a simpleton as poor gertrude but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not of standards in reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world where the real thing was never said or done or even thought but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs as when mrs welland who knew exactly why archer had pressed her to announce her daughters engagement at the beaufort ball and had indeed expected him to do no less yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance and the air of having had her hand forced quite as in the books on primitive man that people of advanced culture were beginning to read the savage bride is dragged with shrieks from her parents tent the result of course was that the young girl who was the centre of this elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable for her very frankness and assurance she was frank poor darling because she had nothing to conceal assured because she knew of nothing to be on her guard against and with no better preparation than this she was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called the facts of life the young man was sincerely but placidly in love he delighted in the radiant good looks of his betrothed in her health her horsemanship her grace and quickness at games and the shy interest in books and ideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance she had advanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the idyls of the king but not to feel the beauty of ulysses and the lotus eaters she was straightforward loyal and brave she had a sense of humour chiefly proved by her laughing at his jokes and he suspected in the depths of her innocentlygazing soul a glow of feeling that it would be a joy to waken but when he had gone the brief round of her he returned discouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were only an artificial product untrained human nature was not frank and innocent it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive guile and he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious purity so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts and grandmothers and longdead ancestresses because it was supposed to be what he wanted what he had a right to in order that he might exercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow there was a certain triteness in these reflections they were those habitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day but they were generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and selfabasement of which newland archer felt no trace he could not deplore as thackerays heroes so often exasperated him by doing that he had not a blank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she was to give to him he could not get away from the fact that if he had been brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find their way about than the babes in the wood nor could he for all his anxious cogitations see any honest reason any that is unconnected with his own momentary pleasure and the passion of masculine vanity why his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of experience as himself such questions at such an hour were bound to drift through his mind but he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision were due to the inopportune arrival of the countess olenska here he was at the very moment of his betrothala moment for pure thoughts and cloudless hopespitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised all the special problems he would have preferred to let lie hang ellen olenska he grumbled as he covered his fire and began to undress he could not really see why her fate should have the least bearing on his yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to measure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced upon him a few days later the bolt fell the lovell mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as a formal dinner that is three extra footmen two dishes for each course and a roman punch in the middle and had headed their invitations with the words to meet the countess olenska in accordance with the hospitable american fashion which treats strangers as if they were royalties or at least as their ambassadors the guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in which the initiated recognised the firm hand of catherine the great associated with such immemorial standbys as the selfridge merrys who were asked everywhere because they always had been the beauforts on whom there was a claim of relationship and mr sillerton jackson and his sister sophy who went wherever her brother told her to were some of the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant young married set the lawrence leffertses mrs lefferts rushworth the lovely widow the harry thorleys the reggie chiverses and young morris dagonet and his wife who was a van der luyden the company indeed was perfectly assorted since all the members belonged to the little inner group of people who during the long new york season disported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently undiminished zest fortyeight hours later the unbelievable had happened every one had refused the mingotts invitation except the beauforts and old mr jackson and his sister the intended slight was emphasised by the fact that even the reggie chiverses who were of the mingott clan were among those inflicting it and by the uniform wording of the notes in all of which the writers regretted that they were unable to accept without the mitigating plea of a previous engagement that ordinary courtesy prescribed new york society was in those days far too small and too scant in its resources for every one in it including liverystablekeepers butlers and cooks not to know exactly on which evenings people were free and it was thus possible for the recipients of mrs lovell mingotts invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to meet the countess olenska the blow was unexpected but the mingotts as their way was met it gallantly mrs lovell mingott confided the case to mrs welland who confided it to newland archer who aflame at the outrage appealed passionately and authoritatively to his mother who after a painful period of inward resistance and outward temporising succumbed to his instances as she always did and immediately embracing his cause with an energy redoubled by her previous hesitations put on her grey velvet bonnet and said ill go and see louisa van der luyden the new york of newland archers day was a small and slippery pyramid in which as yet hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained at its base was a firm foundation of what mrs archer called plain people an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who as in the case of the spicers or the leffertses or the jacksons had been raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans people mrs archer always said were not as particular as they used to be and with old catherine spicer ruling one end of fifth avenue and julius beaufort the other you couldnt expect the old traditions to last much longer firmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum was the compact and dominant group which the mingotts newlands chiverses and mansons so actively represented most people imagined them to be the very apex of the pyramid but they themselves at least those of mrs archers generation were aware that in the eyes of the professional genealogist only a still smaller number of families could lay claim to that eminence dont tell me mrs archer would say to her children all this modern newspaper rubbish about a new york aristocracy if there is one neither the mingotts nor the mansons belong to it no nor the newlands or the chiverses either our grandfathers and greatgrandfathers were just respectable english or dutch merchants who came to the colonies to make their fortune and stayed here because they did so well one of your greatgrandfathers signed the declaration and another was a general on washingtons staff and received general burgoynes sword after the battle of saratoga these are things to be proud of but they have nothing to do with rank or class new york has always been a commercial community and there are not more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin in the real sense of the word mrs archer and her son and daughter like every one else in new york knew who these privileged beings were the dagonets of washington square who came of an old english county family allied with the pitts and foxes the lannings who had intermarried with the descendants of count de grasse and the van der luydens direct descendants of the first dutch governor of manhattan and related by prerevolutionary marriages to several members of the french and british aristocracy the lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively miss lannings who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family portraits and chippendale the dagonets were a considerable clan allied to the best names in baltimore and philadelphia but the van der luydens who stood above all of them had faded into a kind of superterrestrial twilight from which only two figures impressively emerged those of mr and mrs henry van der luyden mrs henry van der luyden had been louisa dagonet and her mother had been the granddaughter of colonel du lac of an old channel island family who had fought under cornwallis and had settled in maryland after the war with his bride lady angelica trevenna fifth daughter of the earl of st austrey the tie between the dagonets the du lacs of maryland and their aristocratic cornish kinsfolk the trevennas had always remained close and cordial mr and mrs van der luyden had more than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of trevenna the duke of st austrey at his countryseat in cornwall and at st austrey in gloucestershire and his grace had frequently announced his intention of some day returning their visit without the duchess who feared the atlantic mr and mrs van der luyden divided their time between trevenna their place in maryland and skuytercliff the great estate on the hudson which had been one of the colonial grants of the dutch government to the famous first governor and of which mr van der luyden was still patroon their large solemn house in madison avenue was seldom opened and when they came to town they received in it only their most intimate friends i wish you would go with me newland his mother said suddenly pausing at the door of the brown coupe louisa is fond of you and of course its on account of dear may that im taking this stepand also because if we dont all stand together therell be no such thing as society left mrs henry van der luyden listened in silence to her cousin mrs archers narrative it was all very well to tell yourself in advance that mrs van der luyden was always silent and that though noncommittal by nature and training she was very kind to the people she really liked even personal experience of these facts was not always a protection from the chill that descended on one in the highceilinged whitewalled madison avenue drawingroom with the pale brocaded armchairs so obviously uncovered for the occasion and the gauze still veiling the ormolu mantel ornaments and the beautiful old carved frame of gainsboroughs lady angelica du lac mrs van der luydens portrait by huntington in black velvet and venetian point faced that of her lovely ancestress it was generally considered as fine as a cabanel and though twenty years had elapsed since its execution was still a perfect likeness indeed the mrs van der luyden who sat beneath it listening to mrs archer might have been the twinsister of the fair and still youngish woman drooping against a gilt armchair before a green rep curtain mrs van der luyden still wore black velvet and venetian point when she went into societyor rather since she never dined out when she threw open her own doors to receive it her fair hair which had faded without turning grey was still parted in flat overlapping points on her forehead and the straight nose that divided her pale blue eyes was only a little more pinched about the nostrils than when the portrait had been painted she always indeed struck newland archer as having been rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a perfectly irreproachable existence as bodies caught in glaciers keep for years a rosy lifeindeath like all his family he esteemed and admired mrs van der luyden but he found her gentle bending sweetness less approachable than the grimness of some of his mothers old aunts fierce spinsters who said no on principle before they knew what they were going to be asked mrs van der luydens attitude said neither yes nor no but always appeared to incline to clemency till her thin lips wavering into the shadow of a smile made the almost invariable reply i shall first have to talk this over with my husband she and mr van der luyden were so exactly alike that archer often wondered how after forty years of the closest conjugality two such merged identities ever separated themselves enough for anything as controversial as a talkingover but as neither had ever reached a decision without prefacing it by this mysterious conclave mrs archer and her son having set forth their case waited resignedly for the familiar phrase mrs van der luyden however who had seldom surprised any one now surprised them by reaching her long hand toward the bellrope i think she said i should like henry to hear what you have told me a footman appeared to whom she gravely added if mr van der luyden has finished reading the newspaper please ask him to be kind enough to come she said reading the newspaper in the tone in which a ministers wife might have said presiding at a cabinet meetingnot from any arrogance of mind but because the habit of a lifetime and the attitude of her friends and relations had led her to consider mr van der luydens least gesture as having an almost sacerdotal importance her promptness of action showed that she considered the case as pressing as mrs archer but lest she should be thought to have committed herself in advance she added with the sweetest look henry always enjoys seeing you dear adeline and he will wish to congratulate newland the double doors had solemnly reopened and between them appeared mr henry van der luyden tall spare and frockcoated with faded fair hair a straight nose like his wifes and the same look of frozen gentleness in eyes that were merely pale grey instead of pale blue mr van der luyden greeted mrs archer with cousinly affability proffered to newland lowvoiced congratulations couched in the same language as his wifes and seated himself in one of the brocade armchairs with the simplicity of a reigning sovereign i had just finished reading the times he said laying his long fingertips together in town my mornings are so much occupied that i find it more convenient to read the newspapers after luncheon ah theres a great deal to be said for that planindeed i think my uncle egmont used to say he found it less agitating not to read the morning papers till after dinner said mrs archer responsively yes my good father abhorred hurry but now we live in a constant rush said mr van der luyden in measured tones looking with pleasant deliberation about the large shrouded room which to archer was so complete an image of its owners but i hope you had finished your reading henry his wife interposed quitequite he reassured her then i should like adeline to tell you oh its really newlands story said his mother smiling and proceeded to rehearse once more the monstrous tale of the affront inflicted on mrs lovell mingott of course she ended augusta welland and mary mingott both felt that especially in view of newlands engagement you and henry ought to know ah said mr van der luyden drawing a deep breath there was a silence during which the tick of the monumental ormolu clock on the white marble mantelpiece grew as loud as the boom of a minutegun archer contemplated with awe the two slender faded figures seated side by side in a kind of viceregal rigidity mouthpieces of some remote ancestral authority which fate compelled them to wield when they would so much rather have lived in simplicity and seclusion digging invisible weeds out of the perfect lawns of skuytercliff and playing patience together in the evenings mr van der luyden was the first to speak you really think this is due to somesome intentional interference of lawrence leffertss he enquired turning to archer im certain of it sir larry has been going it rather harder than usual latelyif cousin louisa wont mind my mentioning ithaving rather a stiff affair with the postmasters wife in their village or some one of that sort and whenever poor gertrude lefferts begins to suspect anything and hes afraid of trouble he gets up a fuss of this kind to show how awfully moral he is and talks at the top of his voice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he doesnt wish her to know hes simply using madame olenska as a lightningrod ive seen him try the same thing often before the leffertses said mrs van der luyden the leffertses echoed mrs archer what would uncle egmont have said of lawrence leffertss pronouncing on anybodys social position it shows what society has come to well hope it has not quite come to that said mr van der luyden firmly ah if only you and louisa went out more sighed mrs archer but instantly she became aware of her mistake the van der luydens were morbidly sensitive to any criticism of their secluded existence they were the arbiters of fashion the court of last appeal and they knew it and bowed to their fate but being shy and retiring persons with no natural inclination for their part they lived as much as possible in the sylvan solitude of skuytercliff and when they came to town declined all invitations on the plea of mrs van der luydens health newland archer came to his mothers rescue everybody in new york knows what you and cousin louisa represent thats why mrs mingott felt she ought not to allow this slight on countess olenska to pass without consulting you mrs van der luyden glanced at her husband who glanced back at her it is the principle that i dislike said mr van der luyden as long as a member of a wellknown family is backed up by that family it should be consideredfinal it seems so to me said his wife as if she were producing a new thought i had no idea mr van der luyden continued that things had come to such a pass he paused and looked at his wife again it occurs to me my dear that the countess olenska is already a sort of relationthrough medora mansons first husband at any rate she will be when newland marries he turned toward the young man have you read this mornings times newland why yes sir said archer who usually tossed off half a dozen papers with his morning coffee husband and wife looked at each other again their pale eyes clung together in prolonged and serious consultation then a faint smile fluttered over mrs van der luydens face she had evidently guessed and approved mr van der luyden turned to mrs archer if louisas health allowed her to dine outi wish you would say to mrs lovell mingottshe and i would have been happy toerfill the places of the lawrence leffertses at her dinner he paused to let the irony of this sink in as you know this is impossible mrs archer sounded a sympathetic assent but newland tells me he has read this mornings times therefore he has probably seen that louisas relative the duke of st austrey arrives next week on the russia he is coming to enter his new sloop the guinevere in next summers international cup race and also to have a little canvasback shooting at trevenna mr van der luyden paused again and continued with increasing benevolence before taking him down to maryland we are inviting a few friends to meet him hereonly a little dinnerwith a reception afterward i am sure louisa will be as glad as i am if countess olenska will let us include her among our guests he got up bent his long body with a stiff friendliness toward his cousin and added i think i have louisas authority for saying that she will herself leave the invitation to dine when she drives out presently with our cardsof course with our cards mrs archer who knew this to be a hint that the seventeenhand chestnuts which were never kept waiting were at the door rose with a hurried murmur of thanks mrs van der luyden beamed on her with the smile of esther interceding with ahasuerus but her husband raised a protesting hand there is nothing to thank me for dear adeline nothing whatever this kind of thing must not happen in new york it shall not as long as i can help it he pronounced with sovereign gentleness as he steered his cousins to the door two hours later every one knew that the great cspring barouche in which mrs van der luyden took the air at all seasons had been seen at old mrs mingotts door where a large square envelope was handed in and that evening at the opera mr sillerton jackson was able to state that the envelope contained a card inviting the countess olenska to the dinner which the van der luydens were giving the following week for their cousin the duke of st austrey some of the younger men in the club box exchanged a smile at this announcement and glanced sideways at lawrence lefferts who sat carelessly in the front of the box pulling his long fair moustache and who remarked with authority as the soprano paused no one but patti ought to attempt the sonnambula it was generally agreed in new york that the countess olenska had lost her looks she had appeared there first in newland archers boyhood as a brilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten of whom people said that she ought to be painted her parents had been continental wanderers and after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both and been taken in charge by her aunt medora manson also a wanderer who was herself returning to new york to settle down poor medora repeatedly widowed was always coming home to settle down each time in a less expensive house and bringing with her a new husband or an adopted child but after a few months she invariably parted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward and having got rid of her house at a loss set out again on her wanderings as her mother had been a rushworth and her last unhappy marriage had linked her to one of the crazy chiverses new york looked indulgently on her eccentricities but when she returned with her little orphaned niece whose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for travel people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in such hands every one was disposed to be kind to little ellen mingott though her dusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed unsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her parents it was one of the misguided medoras many peculiarities to flout the unalterable rules that regulated american mourning and when she stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that the crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter than those of her sistersinlaw while little ellen was in crimson merino and amber beads like a gipsy foundling but new york had so long resigned itself to medora that only a few old ladies shook their heads over ellens gaudy clothes while her other relations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits she was a fearless and familiar little thing who asked disconcerting questions made precocious comments and possessed outlandish arts such as dancing a spanish shawl dance and singing neapolitan lovesongs to a guitar under the direction of her aunt whose real name was mrs thorley chivers but who having received a papal title had resumed her first husbands patronymic and called herself the marchioness manson because in italy she could turn it into manzoni the little girl received an expensive but incoherent education which included drawing from the model a thing never dreamed of before and playing the piano in quintets with professional musicians of course no good could come of this and when a few years later poor chivers finally died in a madhouse his widow draped in strange weeds again pulled up stakes and departed with ellen who had grown into a tall bony girl with conspicuous eyes for some time no more was heard of them then news came of ellens marriage to an immensely rich polish nobleman of legendary fame whom she had met at a ball at the tuileries and who was said to have princely establishments in paris nice and florence a yacht at cowes and many square miles of shooting in transylvania she disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis and when a few years later medora again came back to new york subdued impoverished mourning a third husband and in quest of a still smaller house people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do something for her then came the news that ellens own marriage had ended in disaster and that she was herself returning home to seek rest and oblivion among her kinsfolk these things passed through newland archers mind a week later as he watched the countess olenska enter the van der luyden drawingroom on the evening of the momentous dinner the occasion was a solemn one and he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off she came rather late one hand still ungloved and fastening a bracelet about her wrist yet she entered without any appearance of haste or embarrassment the drawingroom in which new yorks most chosen company was somewhat awfully assembled in the middle of the room she paused looking about her with a grave mouth and smiling eyes and in that instant newland archer rejected the general verdict on her looks it was true that her early radiance was gone the red cheeks had paled she was thin worn a little olderlooking than her age which must have been nearly thirty but there was about her the mysterious authority of beauty a sureness in the carriage of the head the movement of the eyes which without being in the least theatrical struck his as highly trained and full of a conscious power at the same time she was simpler in manner than most of the ladies present and many people as he heard afterward from janey were disappointed that her appearance was not more stylishfor stylishness was what new york most valued it was perhaps archer reflected because her early vivacity had disappeared because she was so quietquiet in her movements her voice and the tones of her lowpitched voice new york had expected something a good deal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history the dinner was a somewhat formidable business dining with the van der luydens was at best no light matter and dining there with a duke who was their cousin was almost a religious solemnity it pleased archer to think that only an old new yorker could perceive the shade of difference to new york between being merely a duke and being the van der luydens duke new york took stray noblemen calmly and even except in the struthers set with a certain distrustful hauteur but when they presented such credentials as these they were received with an oldfashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken in ascribing solely to their standing in debrett it was for just such distinctions that the young man cherished his old new york even while he smiled at it the van der luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of the occasion the du lac sevres and the trevenna george ii plate were out so was the van der luyden lowestoft east india company and the dagonet crown derby mrs van der luyden looked more than ever like a cabanel and mrs archer in her grandmothers seedpearls and emeralds reminded her son of an isabey miniature all the ladies had on their handsomest jewels but it was characteristic of the house and the occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy oldfashioned settings and old miss lanning who had been persuaded to come actually wore her mothers cameos and a spanish blonde shawl the countess olenska was the only young woman at the dinner yet as archer scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich feathers they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers it frightened him to think what must have gone to the making of her eyes the duke of st austrey who sat at his hostesss right was naturally the chief figure of the evening but if the countess olenska was less conspicuous than had been hoped the duke was almost invisible being a wellbred man he had not like another recent ducal visitor come to the dinner in a shootingjacket but his evening clothes were so shabby and baggy and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun that with his stooping way of sitting and the vast beard spreading over his shirtfront he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner attire he was short roundshouldered sunburnt with a thick nose small eyes and a sociable smile but he seldom spoke and when he did it was in such low tones that despite the frequent silences of expectation about the table his remarks were lost to all but his neighbours when the men joined the ladies after dinner the duke went straight up to the countess olenska and they sat down in a corner and plunged into animated talk neither seemed aware that the duke should first have paid his respects to mrs lovell mingott and mrs headly chivers and the countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac mr urban dagonet of washington square who in order to have the pleasure of meeting her had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out between january and april the two chatted together for nearly twenty minutes then the countess rose and walking alone across the wide drawingroom sat down at newland archers side it was not the custom in new york drawingrooms for a lady to get up and walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of another etiquette required that she should wait immovable as an idol while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each other at her side but the countess was apparently unaware of having broken any rule she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside archer and looked at him with the kindest eyes i want you to talk to me about may she said instead of answering her he asked you knew the duke before oh yeswe used to see him every winter at nice hes very fond of gamblinghe used to come to the house a great deal she said it in the simplest manner as if she had said hes fond of wildflowers and after a moment she added candidly i think hes the dullest man i ever met this pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her previous remark had caused him it was undeniably exciting to meet a lady who found the van der luydens duke dull and dared to utter the opinion he longed to question her to hear more about the life of which her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse but he feared to touch on distressing memories and before he could think of anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject may is a darling ive seen no young girl in new york so handsome and so intelligent are you very much in love with her newland archer reddened and laughed as much as a man can be she continued to consider him thoughtfully as if not to miss any shade of meaning in what he said do you think then there is a limit to being in love if there is i havent found it she glowed with sympathy ahits really and truly a romance the most romantic of romances how delightful and you found it all out for yourselvesit was not in the least arranged for you archer looked at her incredulously have you forgotten he asked with a smile that in our country we dont allow our marriages to be arranged for us a dusky blush rose to her cheek and he instantly regretted his words yes she answered id forgotten you must forgive me if i sometimes make these mistakes i dont always remember that everything here is good that wasthat was bad where ive come from she looked down at her viennese fan of eagle feathers and he saw that her lips trembled im so sorry he said impulsively but you are among friends here you know yesi know wherever i go i have that feeling thats why i came home i want to forget everything else to become a complete american again like the mingotts and wellands and you and your delightful mother and all the other good people here tonight ah heres may arriving and you will want to hurry away to her she added but without moving and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the young mans face the drawingrooms were beginning to fill up with afterdinner guests and following madame olenskas glance archer saw may welland entering with her mother in her dress of white and silver with a wreath of silver blossoms in her hair the tall girl looked like a diana just alight from the chase oh said archer i have so many rivals you see shes already surrounded theres the duke being introduced then stay with me a little longer madame olenska said in a low tone just touching his knee with her plumed fan it was the lightest touch but it thrilled him like a caress yes let me stay he answered in the same tone hardly knowing what he said but just then mr van der luyden came up followed by old mr urban dagonet the countess greeted them with her grave smile and archer feeling his hosts admonitory glance on him rose and surrendered his seat madame olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye tomorrow then after fivei shall expect you she said and then turned back to make room for mr dagonet tomorrow archer heard himself repeating though there had been no engagement and during their talk she had given him no hint that she wished to see him again as he moved away he saw lawrence lefferts tall and resplendent leading his wife up to be introduced and heard gertrude lefferts say as she beamed on the countess with her large unperceiving smile but i think we used to go to dancingschool together when we were children behind her waiting their turn to name themselves to the countess archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had declined to meet her at mrs lovell mingotts as mrs archer remarked when the van der luydens chose they knew how to give a lesson the wonder was that they chose so seldom the young man felt a touch on his arm and saw mrs van der luyden looking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the family diamonds it was good of you dear newland to devote yourself so unselfishly to madame olenska i told your cousin henry he must really come to the rescue he was aware of smiling at her vaguely and she added as if condescending to his natural shyness ive never seen may looking lovelier the duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room the countess olenska had said after five and at half after the hour newland archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant wisteria throttling its feeble castiron balcony which she had hired far down west twentythird street from the vagabond medora it was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in small dressmakers birdstuffers and people who wrote were her nearest neighbours and further down the dishevelled street archer recognised a dilapidated wooden house at the end of a paved path in which a writer and journalist called winsett whom he used to come across now and then had mentioned that he lived winsett did not invite people to his house but he had once pointed it out to archer in the course of a nocturnal stroll and the latter had asked himself with a little shiver if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals madame olenskas own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance only by a little more paint about the windowframes and as archer mustered its modest front he said to himself that the polish count must have robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions the young man had spent an unsatisfactory day he had lunched with the wellands hoping afterward to carry off may for a walk in the park he wanted to have her to himself to tell her how enchanting she had looked the night before and how proud he was of her and to press her to hasten their marriage but mrs welland had firmly reminded him that the round of family visits was not half over and when he hinted at advancing the date of the wedding had raised reproachful eyebrows and sighed out twelve dozen of everythinghandembroidered packed in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to another and archer when the afternoons round was over parted from his betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild animal cunningly trapped he supposed that his readings in anthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after all a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling but when he remembered that the wellands did not expect the wedding to take place till the following autumn and pictured what his life would be till then a dampness fell upon his spirit tomorrow mrs welland called after him well do the chiverses and the dallases and he perceived that she was going through their two families alphabetically and that they were only in the first quarter of the alphabet he had meant to tell may of the countess olenskas requesther command ratherthat he should call on her that afternoon but in the brief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to say besides it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the matter he knew that may most particularly wanted him to be kind to her cousin was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of their engagement it gave him an odd sensation to reflect that but for the countesss arrival he might have been if not still a free man at least a man less irrevocably pledged but may had willed it so and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibilityand therefore at liberty if he chose to call on her cousin without telling her as he stood on madame olenskas threshold curiosity was his uppermost feeling he was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him he concluded that she was less simple than she seemed the door was opened by a swarthy foreignlooking maid with a prominent bosom under a gay neckerchief whom he vaguely fancied to be sicilian she welcomed him with all her white teeth and answering his enquiries by a headshake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into a low firelit drawingroom the room was empty and she left him for an appreciable time to wonder whether she had gone to find her mistress or whether she had not understood what he was there for and thought it might be to wind the clockof which he perceived that the only visible specimen had stopped he knew that the southern races communicated with each other in the language of pantomime and was mortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible at length she returned with a lamp and archer having meanwhile put together a phrase out of dante and petrarch evoked the answer la signora e fuori ma verra subito which he took to mean shes outbut youll soon see what he saw meanwhile with the help of the lamp was the faded shadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known he knew that the countess olenska had brought some of her possessions with herbits of wreckage she called themand these he supposed were represented by some small slender tables of dark wood a delicate little greek bronze on the chimneypiece and a stretch of red damask nailed on the discoloured wallpaper behind a couple of italianlooking pictures in old frames newland archer prided himself on his knowledge of italian art his boyhood had been saturated with ruskin and he had read all the latest books john addington symonds vernon lees euphorion the essays of p g hamerton and a wonderful new volume called the renaissance by walter pater he talked easily of botticelli and spoke of fra angelico with a faint condescension but these pictures bewildered him for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at and therefore able to see when he travelled in italy and perhaps also his powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding himself in this strange empty house where apparently no one expected him he was sorry that he had not told may welland of countess olenskas request and a little disturbed by the thought that his betrothed might come in to see her cousin what would she think if she found him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting alone in the dusk at a ladys fireside but since he had come he meant to wait and he sank into a chair and stretched his feet to the logs it was odd to have summoned him in that way and then forgotten him but archer felt more curious than mortified the atmosphere of the room was so different from any he had ever breathed that selfconsciousness vanished in the sense of adventure he had been before in drawingrooms hung with red damask with pictures of the italian school what struck him was the way in which medora mansons shabby hired house with its blighted background of pampas grass and rogers statuettes had by a turn of the hand and the skilful use of a few properties been transformed into something intimate foreign subtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments he tried to analyse the trick to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and tables were grouped in the fact that only two jacqueminot roses of which nobody ever bought less than a dozen had been placed in the slender vase at his elbow and in the vague pervading perfume that was not what one put on handkerchiefs but rather like the scent of some faroff bazaar a smell made up of turkish coffee and ambergris and dried roses his mind wandered away to the question of what mays drawingroom would look like he knew that mr welland who was behaving very handsomely already had his eye on a newly built house in east thirtyninth street the neighbourhood was thought remote and the house was built in a ghastly greenishyellow stone that the younger architects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone of which the uniform hue coated new york like a cold chocolate sauce but the plumbing was perfect archer would have liked to travel to put off the housing question but though the wellands approved of an extended european honeymoon perhaps even a winter in egypt they were firm as to the need of a house for the returning couple the young man felt that his fate was sealed for the rest of his life he would go up every evening between the castiron railings of that greenishyellow doorstep and pass through a pompeian vestibule into a hall with a wainscoting of varnished yellow wood but beyond that his imagination could not travel he knew the drawingroom above had a bay window but he could not fancy how may would deal with it she submitted cheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the welland drawingroom to its sham buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern saxe he saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything different in her own house and his only comfort was to reflect that she would probably let him arrange his library as he pleasedwhich would be of course with sincere eastlake furniture and the plain new bookcases without glass doors the roundbosomed maid came in drew the curtains pushed back a log and said consolingly verraverra when she had gone archer stood up and began to wander about should he wait any longer his position was becoming rather foolish perhaps he had misunderstood madame olenskaperhaps she had not invited him after all down the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a steppers hoofs they stopped before the house and he caught the opening of a carriage door parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk a streetlamp faced him and in its light he saw julius beauforts compact english brougham drawn by a big roan and the banker descending from it and helping out madame olenska beaufort stood hat in hand saying something which his companion seemed to negative then they shook hands and he jumped into his carriage while she mounted the steps when she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing archer there surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to how do you like my funny house she asked to me its like heaven as she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away with her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes youve arranged it delightfully he rejoined alive to the flatness of the words but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming desire to be simple and striking oh its a poor little place my relations despise it but at any rate its less gloomy than the van der luydens the words gave him an electric shock for few were the rebellious spirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der luydens gloomy those privileged to enter it shivered there and spoke of it as handsome but suddenly he was glad that she had given voice to the general shiver its deliciouswhat youve done here he repeated i like the little house she admitted but i suppose what i like is the blessedness of its being here in my own country and my own town and then of being alone in it she spoke so low that he hardly heard the last phrase but in his awkwardness he took it up you like so much to be alone yes as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely she sat down near the fire said nastasia will bring the tea presently and signed to him to return to his armchair adding i see youve already chosen your corner leaning back she folded her arms behind her head and looked at the fire under drooping lids this is the hour i like bestdont you a proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer i was afraid youd forgotten the hour beaufort must have been very engrossing she looked amused whyhave you waited long mr beaufort took me to see a number of housessince it seems im not to be allowed to stay in this one she appeared to dismiss both beaufort and himself from her mind and went on ive never been in a city where there seems to be such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques what does it matter where one lives im told this street is respectable its not fashionable fashionable do you all think so much of that why not make ones own fashions but i suppose ive lived too independently at any rate i want to do what you all doi want to feel cared for and safe he was touched as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her need of guidance thats what your friends want you to feel new yorks an awfully safe place he added with a flash of sarcasm yes isnt it one feels that she cried missing the mockery being here is likelikebeing taken on a holiday when one has been a good little girl and done all ones lessons the analogy was well meant but did not altogether please him he did not mind being flippant about new york but disliked to hear any one else take the same tone he wondered if she did not begin to see what a powerful engine it was and how nearly it had crushed her the lovell mingotts dinner patched up in extremis out of all sorts of social odds and ends ought to have taught her the narrowness of her escape but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted disaster or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van der luyden evening archer inclined to the former theory he fancied that her new york was still completely undifferentiated and the conjecture nettled him last night he said new york laid itself out for you the van der luydens do nothing by halves no how kind they are it was such a nice party every one seems to have such an esteem for them the terms were hardly adequate she might have spoken in that way of a teaparty at the dear old miss lannings the van der luydens said archer feeling himself pompous as he spoke are the most powerful influence in new york society unfortunatelyowing to her healththey receive very seldom she unclasped her hands from behind her head and looked at him meditatively isnt that perhaps the reason the reason for their great influence that they make themselves so rare he coloured a little stared at herand suddenly felt the penetration of the remark at a stroke she had pricked the van der luydens and they collapsed he laughed and sacrificed them nastasia brought the tea with handleless japanese cups and little covered dishes placing the tray on a low table but youll explain these things to meyoull tell me all i ought to know madame olenska continued leaning forward to hand him his cup its you who are telling me opening my eyes to things id looked at so long that id ceased to see them she detached a small gold cigarettecase from one of her bracelets held it out to him and took a cigarette herself on the chimney were long spills for lighting them ah then we can both help each other but i want help so much more you must tell me just what to do it was on the tip of his tongue to reply dont be seen driving about the streets with beaufort but he was being too deeply drawn into the atmosphere of the room which was her atmosphere and to give advice of that sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for attarofroses in samarkand that one should always be provided with arctics for a new york winter new york seemed much farther off than samarkand and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering what might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look at his native city objectively viewed thus as through the wrong end of a telescope it looked disconcertingly small and distant but then from samarkand it would a flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire stretching her thin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails the light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her braids and made her pale face paler there are plenty of people to tell you what to do archer rejoined obscurely envious of them ohall my aunts and my dear old granny she considered the idea impartially theyre all a little vexed with me for setting up for myselfpoor granny especially she wanted to keep me with her but i had to be free he was impressed by this light way of speaking of the formidable catherine and moved by the thought of what must have given madame olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of freedom but the idea of beaufort gnawed him i think i understand how you feel he said still your family can advise you explain differences show you the way she lifted her thin black eyebrows is new york such a labyrinth i thought it so straight up and downlike fifth avenue and with all the cross streets numbered she seemed to guess his faint disapproval of this and added with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face if you knew how i like it for just thatthe straightupanddownness and the big honest labels on everything he saw his chance everything may be labelledbut everybody is not perhaps i may simplify too muchbut youll warn me if i do she turned from the fire to look at him there are only two people here who make me feel as if they understood what i mean and could explain things to me you and mr beaufort archer winced at the joining of the names and then with a quick readjustment understood sympathised and pitied so close to the powers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely in their air but since she felt that he understood her also his business would be to make her see beaufort as he really was with all he representedand abhor it he answered gently i understand but just at first dont let go of your old friends hands i mean the older women your granny mingott mrs welland mrs van der luyden they like and admire youthey want to help you she shook her head and sighed oh i knowi know but on condition that they dont hear anything unpleasant aunt welland put it in those very words when i tried does no one want to know the truth here mr archer the real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend she lifted her hands to her face and he saw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob madame olenskaoh dont ellen he cried starting up and bending over her he drew down one of her hands clasping and chafing it like a childs while he murmured reassuring words but in a moment she freed herself and looked up at him with wet lashes does no one cry here either i suppose theres no need to in heaven she said straightening her loosened braids with a laugh and bending over the teakettle it was burnt into his consciousness that he had called her ellencalled her so twice and that she had not noticed it far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white figure of may wellandin new york suddenly nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich italian madame olenska again with a hand at her hair uttered an exclamation of assenta flashing giagiaand the duke of st austrey entered piloting a tremendous blackwigged and redplumed lady in overflowing furs my dear countess ive brought an old friend of mine to see youmrs struthers she wasnt asked to the party last night and she wants to know you the duke beamed on the group and madame olenska advanced with a murmur of welcome toward the queer couple she seemed to have no idea how oddly matched they were nor what a liberty the duke had taken in bringing his companionand to do him justice as archer perceived the duke seemed as unaware of it himself of course i want to know you my dear cried mrs struthers in a round rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig i want to know everybody whos young and interesting and charming and the duke tells me you like musicdidnt you duke youre a pianist yourself i believe well do you want to hear sarasate play tomorrow evening at my house you know ive something going on every sunday eveningits the day when new york doesnt know what to do with itself and so i say to it come and be amused and the duke thought youd be tempted by sarasate youll find a number of your friends madame olenskas face grew brilliant with pleasure how kind how good of the duke to think of me she pushed a chair up to the teatable and mrs struthers sank into it delectably of course i shall be too happy to come thats all right my dear and bring your young gentleman with you mrs struthers extended a hailfellow hand to archer i cant put a name to youbut im sure ive met youive met everybody here or in paris or london arent you in diplomacy all the diplomatists come to me you like music too duke you must be sure to bring him the duke said rather from the depths of his beard and archer withdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of spine as a selfconscious schoolboy among careless and unnoticing elders he was not sorry for the denouement of his visit he only wished it had come sooner and spared him a certain waste of emotion as he went out into the wintry night new york again became vast and imminent and may welland the loveliest woman in it he turned into his florists to send her the daily box of liliesofthevalley which to his confusion he found he had forgotten that morning as he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced about the embowered shop and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses he had never seen any as sungolden before and his first impulse was to send them to may instead of the lilies but they did not look like herthere was something too rich too strong in their fiery beauty in a sudden revulsion of mood and almost without knowing what he did he signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box and slipped his card into a second envelope on which he wrote the name of the countess olenska then just as he was turning away he drew the card out again and left the empty envelope on the box theyll go at once he enquired pointing to the roses the florist assured him that they would the next day he persuaded may to escape for a walk in the park after luncheon as was the custom in oldfashioned episcopalian new york she usually accompanied her parents to church on sunday afternoons but mrs welland condoned her truancy having that very morning won her over to the necessity of a long engagement with time to prepare a handembroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens the day was delectable the bare vaulting of trees along the mall was ceiled with lapis lazuli and arched above snow that shone like splintered crystals it was the weather to call out mays radiance and she burned like a young maple in the frost archer was proud of the glances turned on her and the simple joy of possessorship cleared away his underlying perplexities its so deliciouswaking every morning to smell liliesofthevalley in ones room she said yesterday they came late i hadnt time in the morning but your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much more than if youd given a standing order and they came every morning on the minute like ones musicteacheras i know gertrude leffertss did for instance when she and lawrence were engaged ahthey would laughed archer amused at her keenness he looked sideways at her fruitlike cheek and felt rich and secure enough to add when i sent your lilies yesterday afternoon i saw some rather gorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to madame olenska was that right how dear of you anything of that kind delights her its odd she didnt mention it she lunched with us today and spoke of mr beauforts having sent her wonderful orchids and cousin henry van der luyden a whole hamper of carnations from skuytercliff she seems so surprised to receive flowers dont people send them in europe she thinks it such a pretty custom oh well no wonder mine were overshadowed by beauforts said archer irritably then he remembered that he had not put a card with the roses and was vexed at having spoken of them he wanted to say i called on your cousin yesterday but hesitated if madame olenska had not spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should yet not to do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked to shake off the question he began to talk of their own plans their future and mrs wellands insistence on a long engagement if you call it long isabel chivers and reggie were engaged for two years grace and thorley for nearly a year and a half why arent we very well off as we are it was the traditional maidenly interrogation and he felt ashamed of himself for finding it singularly childish no doubt she simply echoed what was said for her but she was nearing her twentysecond birthday and he wondered at what age nice women began to speak for themselves never if we wont let them i suppose he mused and recalled his mad outburst to mr sillerton jackson women ought to be as free as we are it would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young womans eyes and bid her look forth on the world but how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault he shivered a little remembering some of the new ideas in his scientific books and the muchcited instance of the kentucky cavefish which had ceased to develop eyes because they had no use for them what if when he had bidden may welland to open hers they could only look out blankly at blankness we might be much better off we might be altogether togetherwe might travel her face lit up that would be lovely she owned she would love to travel but her mother would not understand their wanting to do things so differently as if the mere differently didnt account for it the wooer insisted newland youre so original she exulted his heart sank for he saw that he was saying all the things that young men in the same situation were expected to say and that she was making the answers that instinct and tradition taught her to makeeven to the point of calling him original original were all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper were like patterns stencilled on a wall cant you and i strike out for ourselves may he had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion and her eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration mercyshall we elope she laughed if you would you do love me newland im so happy but thenwhy not be happier we cant behave like people in novels though can we why notwhy notwhy not she looked a little bored by his insistence she knew very well that they couldnt but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason im not clever enough to argue with you but that kind of thing is rathervulgar isnt it she suggested relieved to have hit on a word that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject are you so much afraid then of being vulgar she was evidently staggered by this of course i should hate itso would you she rejoined a trifle irritably he stood silent beating his stick nervously against his boottop and feeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the discussion she went on lightheartedly oh did i tell you that i showed ellen my ring she thinks it the most beautiful setting she ever saw theres nothing like it in the rue de la paix she said i do love you newland for being so artistic the next afternoon as archer before dinner sat smoking sullenly in his study janey wandered in on him he had failed to stop at his club on the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the law in the leisurely manner common to welltodo new yorkers of his class he was out of spirits and slightly out of temper and a haunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour besieged his brain samenesssameness he muttered the word running through his head like a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tallhatted figures lounging behind the plateglass and because he usually dropped in at the club at that hour he had gone home instead he knew not only what they were likely to be talking about but the part each one would take in the discussion the duke of course would be their principal theme though the appearance in fifth avenue of a goldenhaired lady in a small canarycoloured brougham with a pair of black cobs for which beaufort was generally thought responsible would also doubtless be thoroughly gone into such women as they were called were few in new york those driving their own carriages still fewer and the appearance of miss fanny ring in fifth avenue at the fashionable hour had profoundly agitated society only the day before her carriage had passed mrs lovell mingotts and the latter had instantly rung the little bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home what if it had happened to mrs van der luyden people asked each other with a shudder archer could hear lawrence lefferts at that very hour holding forth on the disintegration of society he raised his head irritably when his sister janey entered and then quickly bent over his book swinburnes chastelardjust out as if he had not seen her she glanced at the writingtable heaped with books opened a volume of the contes drolatiques made a wry face over the archaic french and sighed what learned things you read well he asked as she hovered cassandralike before him mothers very angry angry with whom about what miss sophy jackson has just been here she brought word that her brother would come in after dinner she couldnt say very much because he forbade her to he wishes to give all the details himself hes with cousin louisa van der luyden now for heavens sake my dear girl try a fresh start it would take an omniscient deity to know what youre talking about its not a time to be profane newland mother feels badly enough about your not going to church with a groan he plunged back into his book newland do listen your friend madame olenska was at mrs lemuel strutherss party last night she went there with the duke and mr beaufort at the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the young mans breast to smother it he laughed well what of it i knew she meant to janey paled and her eyes began to project you knew she meant toand you didnt try to stop her to warn her stop her warn her he laughed again im not engaged to be married to the countess olenska the words had a fantastic sound in his own ears youre marrying into her family oh familyfamily he jeered newlanddont you care about family not a brass farthing nor about what cousin louisa van der luyden will think not the half of oneif she thinks such old maids rubbish mother is not an old maid said his virgin sister with pinched lips he felt like shouting back yes she is and so are the van der luydens and so we all are when it comes to being so much as brushed by the wingtip of reality but he saw her long gentle face puckering into tears and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting hang countess olenska dont be a goose janeyim not her keeper no but you did ask the wellands to announce your engagement sooner so that we might all back her up and if it hadnt been for that cousin louisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the duke wellwhat harm was there in inviting her she was the bestlooking woman in the room she made the dinner a little less funereal than the usual van der luyden banquet you know cousin henry asked her to please you he persuaded cousin louisa and now theyre so upset that theyre going back to skuytercliff tomorrow i think newland youd better come down you dont seem to understand how mother feels in the drawingroom newland found his mother she raised a troubled brow from her needlework to ask has janey told you yes he tried to keep his tone as measured as her own but i cant take it very seriously not the fact of having offended cousin louisa and cousin henry the fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as countess olenskas going to the house of a woman they consider common consider well who is but who has good music and amuses people on sunday evenings when the whole of new york is dying of inanition good music all i know is there was a woman who got up on a table and sang the things they sing at the places you go to in paris there was smoking and champagne wellthat kind of thing happens in other places and the world still goes on i dont suppose dear youre really defending the french sunday ive heard you often enough mother grumble at the english sunday when weve been in london new york is neither paris nor london oh no its not her son groaned you mean i suppose that society here is not as brilliant youre right i daresay but we belong here and people should respect our ways when they come among us ellen olenska especially she came back to get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies newland made no answer and after a moment his mother ventured i was going to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin louisa for a moment before dinner he frowned and she continued i thought you might explain to her what youve just said that society abroad is different that people are not as particular and that madame olenska may not have realised how we feel about such things it would be you know dear she added with an innocent adroitness in madame olenskas interest if you did dearest mother i really dont see how were concerned in the matter the duke took madame olenska to mrs strutherssin fact he brought mrs struthers to call on her i was there when they came if the van der luydens want to quarrel with anybody the real culprit is under their own roof quarrel newland did you ever know of cousin henrys quarrelling besides the dukes his guest and a stranger too strangers dont discriminate how should they countess olenska is a new yorker and should have respected the feelings of new york well then if they must have a victim you have my leave to throw madame olenska to them cried her son exasperated i dont see myselfor you eitheroffering ourselves up to expiate her crimes oh of course you see only the mingott side his mother answered in the sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger the sad butler drew back the drawingroom portieres and announced mr henry van der luyden mrs archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an agitated hand another lamp she cried to the retreating servant while janey bent over to straighten her mothers cap mr van der luydens figure loomed on the threshold and newland archer went forward to greet his cousin we were just talking about you sir he said mr van der luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement he drew off his glove to shake hands with the ladies and smoothed his tall hat shyly while janey pushed an armchair forward and archer continued and the countess olenska mrs archer paled aha charming woman i have just been to see her said mr van der luyden complacency restored to his brow he sank into the chair laid his hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the oldfashioned way and went on she has a real gift for arranging flowers i had sent her a few carnations from skuytercliff and i was astonished instead of massing them in big bunches as our headgardener does she had scattered them about loosely here and there i cant say how the duke had told me he said go and see how cleverly shes arranged her drawingroom and she has i should really like to take louisa to see her if the neighbourhood were not sounpleasant a dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from mr van der luyden mrs archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which she had nervously tumbled it and newland leaning against the chimneyplace and twisting a hummingbirdfeather screen in his hand saw janeys gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp the fact is mr van der luyden continued stroking his long grey leg with a bloodless hand weighed down by the patroons great signetring the fact is i dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she wrote me about my flowers and alsobut this is between ourselves of courseto give her a friendly warning about allowing the duke to carry her off to parties with him i dont know if youve heard mrs archer produced an indulgent smile has the duke been carrying her off to parties you know what these english grandees are theyre all alike louisa and i are very fond of our cousinbut its hopeless to expect people who are accustomed to the european courts to trouble themselves about our little republican distinctions the duke goes where hes amused mr van der luyden paused but no one spoke yesit seems he took her with him last night to mrs lemuel strutherss sillerton jackson has just been to us with the foolish story and louisa was rather troubled so i thought the shortest way was to go straight to countess olenska and explainby the merest hint you knowhow we feel in new york about certain things i felt i might without indelicacy because the evening she dined with us she rather suggested rather let me see that she would be grateful for guidance and she was mr van der luyden looked about the room with what would have been selfsatisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions on his face it became a mild benevolence which mrs archers countenance dutifully reflected how kind you both are dear henryalways newland will particularly appreciate what you have done because of dear may and his new relations she shot an admonitory glance at her son who said immensely sir but i was sure youd like madame olenska mr van der luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness i never ask to my house my dear newland he said any one whom i do not like and so i have just told sillerton jackson with a glance at the clock he rose and added but louisa will be waiting we are dining early to take the duke to the opera after the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence fell upon the archer family gracioushow romantic at last broke explosively from janey no one knew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments and her relations had long since given up trying to interpret them mrs archer shook her head with a sigh provided it all turns out for the best she said in the tone of one who knows how surely it will not newland you must stay and see sillerton jackson when he comes this evening i really shant know what to say to him poor mother but he wont come her son laughed stooping to kiss away her frown some two weeks later newland archer sitting in abstracted idleness in his private compartment of the office of letterblair lamson and low attorneys at law was summoned by the head of the firm old mr letterblair the accredited legal adviser of three generations of new york gentility throned behind his mahogany desk in evident perplexity as he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his hand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows his disrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the family physician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified my dear sir he always addressed archer as siri have sent for you to go into a little matter a matter which for the moment i prefer not to mention either to mr skipworth or mr redwood the gentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm for as was always the case with legal associations of old standing in new york all the partners named on the office letterhead were long since dead and mr letterblair for example was professionally speaking his own grandson he leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow for family reasons he continued archer looked up the mingott family said mr letterblair with an explanatory smile and bow mrs manson mingott sent for me yesterday her granddaughter the countess olenska wishes to sue her husband for divorce certain papers have been placed in my hands he paused and drummed on his desk in view of your prospective alliance with the family i should like to consult youto consider the case with youbefore taking any farther steps archer felt the blood in his temples he had seen the countess olenska only once since his visit to her and then at the opera in the mingott box during this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate image receding from his foreground as may welland resumed her rightful place in it he had not heard her divorce spoken of since janeys first random allusion to it and had dismissed the tale as unfounded gossip theoretically the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful to him as to his mother and he was annoyed that mr letterblair no doubt prompted by old catherine mingott should be so evidently planning to draw him into the affair after all there were plenty of mingott men for such jobs and as yet he was not even a mingott by marriage he waited for the senior partner to continue mr letterblair unlocked a drawer and drew out a packet if you will run your eye over these papers archer frowned i beg your pardon sir but just because of the prospective relationship i should prefer your consulting mr skipworth or mr redwood mr letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended it was unusual for a junior to reject such an opening he bowed i respect your scruple sir but in this case i believe true delicacy requires you to do as i ask indeed the suggestion is not mine but mrs manson mingotts and her sons i have seen lovell mingott and also mr welland they all named you archer felt his temper rising he had been somewhat languidly drifting with events for the last fortnight and letting mays fair looks and radiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the mingott claims but this behest of old mrs mingotts roused him to a sense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a prospective soninlaw and he chafed at the role her uncles ought to deal with this he said they have the matter has been gone into by the family they are opposed to the countesss idea but she is firm and insists on a legal opinion the young man was silent he had not opened the packet in his hand does she want to marry again i believe it is suggested but she denies it then will you oblige me mr archer by first looking through these papers afterward when we have talked the case over i will give you my opinion archer withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents since their last meeting he had halfunconsciously collaborated with events in ridding himself of the burden of madame olenska his hour alone with her by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which the duke of st austreys intrusion with mrs lemuel struthers and the countesss joyous greeting of them had rather providentially broken two days later archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement in the van der luydens favour and had said to himself with a touch of tartness that a lady who knew how to thank allpowerful elderly gentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need either the private consolations or the public championship of a young man of his small compass to look at the matter in this light simplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim domestic virtues he could not picture may welland in whatever conceivable emergency hawking about her private difficulties and lavishing her confidences on strange men and she had never seemed to him finer or fairer than in the week that followed he had even yielded to her wish for a long engagement since she had found the one disarming answer to his plea for haste you know when it comes to the point your parents have always let you have your way ever since you were a little girl he argued and she had answered with her clearest look yes and thats what makes it so hard to refuse the very last thing theyll ever ask of me as a little girl that was the old new york note that was the kind of answer he would like always to be sure of his wifes making if one had habitually breathed the new york air there were times when anything less crystalline seemed stifling the papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact but they plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered they consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between count olenskis solicitors and a french legal firm to whom the countess had applied for the settlement of her financial situation there was also a short letter from the count to his wife after reading it newland archer rose jammed the papers back into their envelope and reentered mr letterblairs office here are the letters sir if you wish ill see madame olenska he said in a constrained voice thank youthank you mr archer come and dine with me tonight if youre free and well go into the matter afterward in case you wish to call on our client tomorrow newland archer walked straight home again that afternoon it was a winter evening of transparent clearness with an innocent young moon above the housetops and he wanted to fill his souls lungs with the pure radiance and not exchange a word with any one till he and mr letterblair were closeted together after dinner it was impossible to decide otherwise than he had done he must see madame olenska himself rather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes a great wave of compassion had swept away his indifference and impatience she stood before him as an exposed and pitiful figure to be saved at all costs from farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate he remembered what she had told him of mrs wellands request to be spared whatever was unpleasant in her history and winced at the thought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the new york air so pure are we only pharisees after all he wondered puzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human vileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty for the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had always been he passed for a young man who had not been afraid of risks and he knew that his secret loveaffair with poor silly mrs thorley rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming air of adventure but mrs rushworth was that kind of woman foolish vain clandestine by nature and far more attracted by the secrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he possessed when the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart but now it seemed the redeeming feature of the case the affair in short had been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been through and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed belief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyedand pitied in this view they were sedulously abetted by their mothers aunts and other elderly female relatives who all shared mrs archers belief that when such things happened it was undoubtedly foolish of the man but somehow always criminal of the woman all the elderly ladies whom archer knew regarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous and designing and mere simpleminded man as powerless in her clutches the only thing to do was to persuade him as early as possible to marry a nice girl and then trust to her to look after him in the complicated old european communities archer began to guess loveproblems might be less simple and less easily classified rich and idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such situations and there might even be one in which a woman naturally sensitive and aloof would yet from the force of circumstances from sheer defencelessness and loneliness be drawn into a tie inexcusable by conventional standards on reaching home he wrote a line to the countess olenska asking at what hour of the next day she could receive him and despatched it by a messengerboy who returned presently with a word to the effect that she was going to skuytercliff the next morning to stay over sunday with the van der luydens but that he would find her alone that evening after dinner the note was written on a rather untidy halfsheet without date or address but her hand was firm and free he was amused at the idea of her weekending in the stately solitude of skuytercliff but immediately afterward felt that there of all places she would most feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the unpleasant he was at mr letterblairs punctually at seven glad of the pretext for excusing himself soon after dinner he had formed his own opinion from the papers entrusted to him and did not especially want to go into the matter with his senior partner mr letterblair was a widower and they dined alone copiously and slowly in a dark shabby room hung with yellowing prints of the death of chatham and the coronation of napoleon on the sideboard between fluted sheraton knifecases stood a decanter of haut brion and another of the old lanning port the gift of a client which the wastrel tom lanning had sold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in san franciscoan incident less publicly humiliating to the family than the sale of the cellar after a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers then a young broiled turkey with corn fritters followed by a canvasback with currant jelly and a celery mayonnaise mr letterblair who lunched on a sandwich and tea dined deliberately and deeply and insisted on his guests doing the same finally when the closing rites had been accomplished the cloth was removed cigars were lit and mr letterblair leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward said spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him the whole family are against a divorce and i think rightly archer instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument but why sir if there ever was a case wellwhats the use shes herehes there the atlantics between them shell never get back a dollar more of her money than what hes voluntarily returned to her their damned heathen marriage settlements take precious good care of that as things go over there olenskis acted generously he might have turned her out without a penny the young man knew this and was silent i understand though mr letterblair continued that she attaches no importance to the money therefore as the family say why not let well enough alone archer had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with mr letterblairs view but put into words by this selfish wellfed and supremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the pharisaic voice of a society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant i think thats for her to decide hmhave you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce you mean the threat in her husbands letter what weight would that carry its no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard yes but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the suit unpleasant said archer explosively mr letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows and the young man aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in his mind bowed acquiescently while his senior continued divorce is always unpleasant you agree with me mr letterblair resumed after a waiting silence naturally said archer well then i may count on you the mingotts may count on you to use your influence against the idea archer hesitated i cant pledge myself till ive seen the countess olenska he said at length mr archer i dont understand you do you want to marry into a family with a scandalous divorcesuit hanging over it i dont think that has anything to do with the case mr letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young partner a cautious and apprehensive gaze archer understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn and for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect now that the job had been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it and to guard against the possibility he saw that he must reassure the unimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the mingotts you may be sure sir that i shant commit myself till ive reported to you what i meant was that id rather not give an opinion till ive heard what madame olenska has to say mr letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of the best new york tradition and the young man glancing at his watch pleaded an engagement and took leave oldfashioned new york dined at seven and the habit of afterdinner calls though derided in archers set still generally prevailed as the young man strolled up fifth avenue from waverley place the long thoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before the reggie chiverses where there was a dinner for the duke and the occasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler ascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gaslit hall thus as archer crossed washington square he remarked that old mr du lac was calling on his cousins the dagonets and turning down the corner of west tenth street he saw mr skipworth of his own firm obviously bound on a visit to the miss lannings a little farther up fifth avenue beaufort appeared on his doorstep darkly projected against a blaze of light descended to his private brougham and rolled away to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination it was not an opera night and no one was giving a party so that beauforts outing was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature archer connected it in his mind with a little house beyond lexington avenue in which beribboned window curtains and flowerboxes had recently appeared and before whose newly painted door the canarycoloured brougham of miss fanny ring was frequently seen to wait beyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed mrs archers world lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists musicians and people who wrote these scattered fragments of humanity had never shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure in spite of odd ways they were said to be for the most part quite respectable but they preferred to keep to themselves medora manson in her prosperous days had inaugurated a literary salon but it had soon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it others had made the same attempt and there was a household of blenkersan intense and voluble mother and three blowsy daughters who imitated herwhere one met edwin booth and patti and william winter and the new shakespearian actor george rignold and some of the magazine editors and musical and literary critics mrs archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these persons they were odd they were uncertain they had things one didnt know about in the background of their lives and minds literature and art were deeply respected in the archer set and mrs archer was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable and cultivated society had been when it included such figures as washington irving fitzgreene halleck and the poet of the culprit fay the most celebrated authors of that generation had been gentlemen perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had gentlemanly sentiments but their origin their appearance their hair their intimacy with the stage and the opera made any old new york criterion inapplicable to them when i was a girl mrs archer used to say we knew everybody between the battery and canal street and only the people one knew had carriages it was perfectly easy to place any one then now one cant tell and i prefer not to try only old catherine mingott with her absence of moral prejudices and almost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions might have bridged the abyss but she had never opened a book or looked at a picture and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala nights at the italiens in the days of her triumph at the tuileries possibly beaufort who was her match in daring would have succeeded in bringing about a fusion but his grand house and silkstockinged footmen were an obstacle to informal sociability moreover he was as illiterate as old mrs mingott and considered fellows who wrote as the mere paid purveyors of rich mens pleasures and no one rich enough to influence his opinion had ever questioned it newland archer had been aware of these things ever since he could remember and had accepted them as part of the structure of his universe he knew that there were societies where painters and poets and novelists and men of science and even great actors were as sought after as dukes he had often pictured to himself what it would have been to live in the intimacy of drawingrooms dominated by the talk of merimee whose lettres a une inconnue was one of his inseparables of thackeray browning or william morris but such things were inconceivable in new york and unsettling to think of archer knew most of the fellows who wrote the musicians and the painters he met them at the century or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that were beginning to come into existence he enjoyed them there and was bored with them at the blenkers where they were mingled with fervid and dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities and even after his most exciting talks with ned winsett he always came away with the feeling that if his world was small so was theirs and that the only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where they would naturally merge he was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the countess olenska had lived and suffered and alsoperhapstasted mysterious joys he remembered with what amusement she had told him that her grandmother mingott and the wellands objected to her living in a bohemian quarter given over to people who wrote it was not the peril but the poverty that her family disliked but that shade escaped her and she supposed they considered literature compromising she herself had no fears of it and the books scattered about her drawingroom a part of the house in which books were usually supposed to be out of place though chiefly works of fiction had whetted archers interest with such new names as those of paul bourget huysmans and the goncourt brothers ruminating on these things as he approached her door he was once more conscious of the curious way in which she reversed his values and of the need of thinking himself into conditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be of use in her present difficulty nastasia opened the door smiling mysteriously on the bench in the hall lay a sablelined overcoat a folded opera hat of dull silk with a gold j b on the lining and a white silk muffler there was no mistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of julius beaufort archer was angry so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his card and going away then he remembered that in writing to madame olenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he wished to see her privately he had therefore no one but himself to blame if she had opened her doors to other visitors and he entered the drawingroom with the dogged determination to make beaufort feel himself in the way and to outstay him the banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf which was draped with an old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church candles of yellowish wax he had thrust his chest out supporting his shoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large patentleather foot as archer entered he was smiling and looking down on his hostess who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the chimney a table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it and against the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as tributes from the beaufort hothouses madame olenska sat halfreclined her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving the arm bare to the elbow it was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were called simple dinner dresses a closefitting armour of whaleboned silk slightly open in the neck with lace ruffles filling in the crack and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to show an etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band but madame olenska heedless of tradition was attired in a long robe of red velvet bordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur archer remembered on his last visit to paris seeing a portrait by the new painter carolus duran whose pictures were the sensation of the salon in which the lady wore one of these bold sheathlike robes with her chin nestling in fur there was something perverse and provocative in the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawingroom and in the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms but the effect was undeniably pleasing lord love usthree whole days at skuytercliff beaufort was saying in his loud sneering voice as archer entered youd better take all your furs and a hotwaterbottle why is the house so cold she asked holding out her left hand to archer in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss it no but the missus is said beaufort nodding carelessly to the young man but i thought her so kind she came herself to invite me granny says i must certainly go granny would of course and i say its a shame youre going to miss the little oyster supper id planned for you at delmonicos next sunday with campanini and scalchi and a lot of jolly people she looked doubtfully from the banker to archer ahthat does tempt me except the other evening at mrs strutherss ive not met a single artist since ive been here what kind of artists i know one or two painters very good fellows that i could bring to see you if youd allow me said archer boldly painters are there painters in new york asked beaufort in a tone implying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures and madame olenska said to archer with her grave smile that would be charming but i was really thinking of dramatic artists singers actors musicians my husbands house was always full of them she said the words my husband as if no sinister associations were connected with them and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the lost delights of her married life archer looked at her perplexedly wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to touch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her reputation in order to break with it i do think she went on addressing both men that the imprevu adds to ones enjoyment its perhaps a mistake to see the same people every day its confoundedly dull anyhow new york is dying of dullness beaufort grumbled and when i try to liven it up for you you go back on me comethink better of it sunday is your last chance for campanini leaves next week for baltimore and philadelphia and ive a private room and a steinway and theyll sing all night for me how delicious may i think it over and write to you tomorrow morning she spoke amiably yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice beaufort evidently felt it and being unused to dismissals stood staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes why not now its too serious a question to decide at this late hour do you call it late she returned his glance coolly yes because i have still to talk business with mr archer for a little while ah beaufort snapped there was no appeal from her tone and with a slight shrug he recovered his composure took her hand which he kissed with a practised air and calling out from the threshold i say newland if you can persuade the countess to stop in town of course youre included in the supper left the room with his heavy important step for a moment archer fancied that mr letterblair must have told her of his coming but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his mind you know painters then you live in their milieu she asked her eyes full of interest oh not exactly i dont know that the arts have a milieu here any of them theyre more like a very thinly settled outskirt but you care for such things immensely when im in paris or london i never miss an exhibition i try to keep up she looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from her long draperies i used to care immensely too my life was full of such things but now i want to try not to you want to try not to yes i want to cast off all my old life to become just like everybody else here archer reddened youll never be like everybody else he said she raised her straight eyebrows a little ah dont say that if you knew how i hate to be different her face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask she leaned forward clasping her knee in her thin hands and looking away from him into remote dark distances i want to get away from it all she insisted he waited a moment and cleared his throat i know mr letterblair has told me ah thats the reason ive come he asked me toyou see im in the firm she looked slightly surprised and then her eyes brightened you mean you can manage it for me i can talk to you instead of mr letterblair oh that will be so much easier her tone touched him and his confidence grew with his selfsatisfaction he perceived that she had spoken of business to beaufort simply to get rid of him and to have routed beaufort was something of a triumph i am here to talk about it he repeated she sat silent her head still propped by the arm that rested on the back of the sofa her face looked pale and extinguished as if dimmed by the rich red of her dress she struck archer of a sudden as a pathetic and even pitiful figure now were coming to hard facts he thought conscious in himself of the same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his mother and her contemporaries how little practice he had had in dealing with unusual situations their very vocabulary was unfamiliar to him and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage in face of what was coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy after a pause madame olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence i want to be free i want to wipe out all the past i understand that her face warmed then youll help me first he hesitatedperhaps i ought to know a little more she seemed surprised you know about my husbandmy life with him he made a sign of assent wellthenwhat more is there in this country are such things tolerated im a protestantour church does not forbid divorce in such cases certainly not they were both silent again and archer felt the spectre of count olenskis letter grimacing hideously between them the letter filled only half a page and was just what he had described it to be in speaking of it to mr letterblair the vague charge of an angry blackguard but how much truth was behind it only count olenskis wife could tell ive looked through the papers you gave to mr letterblair he said at length wellcan there be anything more abominable no she changed her position slightly screening her eyes with her lifted hand of course you know archer continued that if your husband chooses to fight the caseas he threatens to yes he can say thingsthings that might be unplmight be disagreeable to you say them publicly so that they would get about and harm you even if if i mean no matter how unfounded they were she paused for a long interval so long that not wishing to keep his eyes on her shaded face he had time to imprint on his mind the exact shape of her other hand the one on her knee and every detail of the three rings on her fourth and fifth fingers among which he noticed a wedding ring did not appear what harm could such accusations even if he made them publicly do me here it was on his lips to exclaim my poor childfar more harm than anywhere else instead he answered in a voice that sounded in his ears like mr letterblairs new york society is a very small world compared with the one youve lived in and its ruled in spite of appearances by a few people withwell rather oldfashioned ideas she said nothing and he continued our ideas about marriage and divorce are particularly oldfashioned our legislation favours divorceour social customs dont never wellnot if the woman however injured however irreproachable has appearances in the least degree against her has exposed herself by any unconventional action toto offensive insinuations she drooped her head a little lower and he waited again intensely hoping for a flash of indignation or at least a brief cry of denial none came a little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow and a log broke in two and sent up a shower of sparks the whole hushed and brooding room seemed to be waiting silently with archer yes she murmured at length thats what my family tell me he winced a little its not unnatural our family she corrected herself and archer coloured for youll be my cousin soon she continued gently i hope so and you take their view he stood up at this wandered across the room stared with void eyes at one of the pictures against the old red damask and came back irresolutely to her side how could he say yes if what your husband hints is true or if youve no way of disproving it sincerely she interjected as he was about to speak he looked down into the fire sincerely thenwhat should you gain that would compensate for the possibilitythe certaintyof a lot of beastly talk but my freedomis that nothing it flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was true and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt how was he to tell her that if she really cherished such a plan the laws of the state were inexorably opposed to it the mere suspicion that the thought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward her but arent you as free as air as it is he returned who can touch you mr letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled oh yes she said indifferently well then is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful think of the newspaperstheir vileness its all stupid and narrow and unjustbut one cant make over society no she acquiesced and her tone was so faint and desolate that he felt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts the individual in such cases is nearly always sacrificed to what is supposed to be the collective interest people cling to any convention that keeps the family togetherprotects the children if there are any he rambled on pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his lips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her silence seemed to have laid bare since she would not or could not say the one word that would have cleared the air his wish was not to let her feel that he was trying to probe into her secret better keep on the surface in the prudent old new york way than risk uncovering a wound he could not heal its my business you know he went on to help you to see these things as the people who are fondest of you see them the mingotts the wellands the van der luydens all your friends and relations if i didnt show you honestly how they judge such questions it wouldnt be fair of me would it he spoke insistently almost pleading with her in his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence she said slowly no it wouldnt be fair the fire had crumbled down to greyness and one of the lamps made a gurgling appeal for attention madame olenska rose wound it up and returned to the fire but without resuming her seat her remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more for either of them to say and archer stood up also very well i will do what you wish she said abruptly the blood rushed to his forehead and taken aback by the suddenness of her surrender he caught her two hands awkwardly in his ii do want to help you he said you do help me good night my cousin he bent and laid his lips on her hands which were cold and lifeless she drew them away and he turned to the door found his coat and hat under the faint gaslight of the hall and plunged out into the winter night bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate it was a crowded night at wallacks theatre the play was the shaughraun with dion boucicault in the title role and harry montague and ada dyas as the lovers the popularity of the admirable english company was at its height and the shaughraun always packed the house in the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved in the stalls and boxes people smiled a little at the hackneyed sentiments and claptrap situations and enjoyed the play as much as the galleries did there was one episode in particular that held the house from floor to ceiling it was that in which harry montague after a sad almost monosyllabic scene of parting with miss dyas bade her goodbye and turned to go the actress who was standing near the mantelpiece and looking down into the fire wore a gray cashmere dress without fashionable loopings or trimmings moulded to her tall figure and flowing in long lines about her feet around her neck was a narrow black velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back when her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the mantelshelf and bowed her face in her hands on the threshold he paused to look at her then he stole back lifted one of the ends of velvet ribbon kissed it and left the room without her hearing him or changing her attitude and on this silent parting the curtain fell it was always for the sake of that particular scene that newland archer went to see the shaughraun he thought the adieux of montague and ada dyas as fine as anything he had ever seen croisette and bressant do in paris or madge robertson and kendal in london in its reticence its dumb sorrow it moved him more than the most famous histrionic outpourings on the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy by reminding himhe could not have said whyof his leavetaking from madame olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier it would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the two situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned newland archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young english actors romantic good looks and miss dyas was a tall redhaired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly face was utterly unlike ellen olenskas vivid countenance nor were archer and madame olenska two lovers parting in heartbroken silence they were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the lawyer the worst possible impression of the clients case wherein then lay the resemblance that made the young mans heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement it seemed to be in madame olenskas mysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities outside the daily run of experience she had hardly ever said a word to him to produce this impression but it was a part of her either a projection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something inherently dramatic passionate and unusual in herself archer had always been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a small part in shaping peoples lots compared with their innate tendency to have things happen to them this tendency he had felt from the first in madame olenska the quiet almost passive young woman struck him as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen no matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to avoid them the exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so thick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently passed unperceived it was precisely the odd absence of surprise in her that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very maelstrom the things she took for granted gave the measure of those she had rebelled against archer had left her with the conviction that count olenskis accusation was not unfounded the mysterious person who figured in his wifes past as the secretary had probably not been unrewarded for his share in her escape the conditions from which she had fled were intolerable past speaking of past believing she was young she was frightened she was desperatewhat more natural than that she should be grateful to her rescuer the pity was that her gratitude put her in the laws eyes and the worlds on a par with her abominable husband archer had made her understand this as he was bound to do he had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly new york on whose larger charity she had apparently counted was precisely the place where she could least hope for indulgence to have to make this fact plain to herand to witness her resigned acceptance of ithad been intolerably painful to him he felt himself drawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity as if her dumblyconfessed error had put her at his mercy humbling yet endearing her he was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret rather than to the cold scrutiny of mr letterblair or the embarrassed gaze of her family he immediately took it upon himself to assure them both that she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce basing her decision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the proceeding and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes from the unpleasantness she had spared them i was sure newland would manage it mrs welland had said proudly of her future soninlaw and old mrs mingott who had summoned him for a confidential interview had congratulated him on his cleverness and added impatiently silly goose i told her myself what nonsense it was wanting to pass herself off as ellen mingott and an old maid when she has the luck to be a married woman and a countess these incidents had made the memory of his last talk with madame olenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the parting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears and he stood up to leave the theatre in doing so he turned to the side of the house behind him and saw the lady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the beauforts lawrence lefferts and one or two other men he had not spoken with her alone since their evening together and had tried to avoid being with her in company but now their eyes met and as mrs beaufort recognised him at the same time and made her languid little gesture of invitation it was impossible not to go into the box beaufort and lefferts made way for him and after a few words with mrs beaufort who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk archer seated himself behind madame olenska there was no one else in the box but mr sillerton jackson who was telling mrs beaufort in a confidential undertone about mrs lemuel strutherss last sunday reception where some people reported that there had been dancing under cover of this circumstantial narrative to which mrs beaufort listened with her perfect smile and her head at just the right angle to be seen in profile from the stalls madame olenska turned and spoke in a low voice do you think she asked glancing toward the stage he will send her a bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning archer reddened and his heart gave a leap of surprise he had called only twice on madame olenska and each time he had sent her a box of yellow roses and each time without a card she had never before made any allusion to the flowers and he supposed she had never thought of him as the sender now her sudden recognition of the gift and her associating it with the tender leavetaking on the stage filled him with an agitated pleasure i was thinking of that tooi was going to leave the theatre in order to take the picture away with me he said to his surprise her colour rose reluctantly and duskily she looked down at the motherofpearl operaglass in her smoothly gloved hands and said after a pause what do you do while may is away i stick to my work he answered faintly annoyed by the question in obedience to a longestablished habit the wellands had left the previous week for st augustine where out of regard for the supposed susceptibility of mr wellands bronchial tubes they always spent the latter part of the winter mr welland was a mild and silent man with no opinions but with many habits with these habits none might interfere and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should always go with him on his annual journey to the south to preserve an unbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind he would not have known where his hairbrushes were or how to provide stamps for his letters if mrs welland had not been there to tell him as all the members of the family adored each other and as mr welland was the central object of their idolatry it never occurred to his wife and may to let him go to st augustine alone and his sons who were both in the law and could not leave new york during the winter always joined him for easter and travelled back with him it was impossible for archer to discuss the necessity of mays accompanying her father the reputation of the mingotts family physician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which mr welland had never had and his insistence on st augustine was therefore inflexible originally it had been intended that mays engagement should not be announced till her return from florida and the fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to alter mr wellands plans archer would have liked to join the travellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his betrothed but he too was bound by custom and conventions little arduous as his professional duties were he would have been convicted of frivolity by the whole mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a holiday in midwinter and he accepted mays departure with the resignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal constituents of married life he was conscious that madame olenska was looking at him under lowered lids i have done what you wishedwhat you advised she said abruptly ahim glad he returned embarrassed by her broaching the subject at such a moment i understandthat you were right she went on a little breathlessly but sometimes life is difficult perplexing i know and i wanted to tell you that i do feel you were right and that im grateful to you she ended lifting her operaglass quickly to her eyes as the door of the box opened and beauforts resonant voice broke in on them archer stood up and left the box and the theatre only the day before he had received a letter from may welland in which with characteristic candour she had asked him to be kind to ellen in their absence she likes you and admires you so muchand you know though she doesnt show it shes still very lonely and unhappy i dont think granny understands her or uncle lovell mingott either they really think shes much worldlier and fonder of society than she is and i can quite see that new york must seem dull to her though the family wont admit it i think shes been used to lots of things we havent got wonderful music and picture shows and celebritiesartists and authors and all the clever people you admire granny cant understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and clothesbut i can see that youre almost the only person in new york who can talk to her about what she really cares for his wise mayhow he had loved her for that letter but he had not meant to act on it he was too busy to begin with and he did not care as an engaged man to play too conspicuously the part of madame olenskas champion he had an idea that she knew how to take care of herself a good deal better than the ingenuous may imagined she had beaufort at her feet mr van der luyden hovering above her like a protecting deity and any number of candidates lawrence lefferts among them waiting their opportunity in the middle distance yet he never saw her or exchanged a word with her without feeling that after all mays ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination ellen olenska was lonely and she was unhappy as he came out into the lobby archer ran across his friend ned winsett the only one among what janey called his clever people with whom he cared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of club and chophouse banter he had caught sight across the house of winsetts shabby roundshouldered back and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the beaufort box the two men shook hands and winsett proposed a bock at a little german restaurant around the corner archer who was not in the mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there declined on the plea that he had work to do at home and winsett said oh well so have i for that matter and ill be the industrious apprentice too they strolled along together and presently winsett said look here what im really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of yourswith the beauforts wasnt she the one your friend lefferts seems so smitten by archer he could not have said why was slightly annoyed what the devil did ned winsett want with ellen olenskas name and above all why did he couple it with leffertss it was unlike winsett to manifest such curiosity but after all archer remembered he was a journalist its not for an interview i hope he laughed wellnot for the press just for myself winsett rejoined the fact is shes a neighbour of minequeer quarter for such a beauty to settle inand shes been awfully kind to my little boy who fell down her area chasing his kitten and gave himself a nasty cut she rushed in bareheaded carrying him in her arms with his knee all beautifully bandaged and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too dazzled to ask her name a pleasant glow dilated archers heart there was nothing extraordinary in the tale any woman would have done as much for a neighbours child but it was just like ellen he felt to have rushed in bareheaded carrying the boy in her arms and to have dazzled poor mrs winsett into forgetting to ask who she was that is the countess olenskaa granddaughter of old mrs mingotts whewa countess whistled ned winsett well i didnt know countesses were so neighbourly mingotts aint they would be if youd let them ah well it was their old interminable argument as to the obstinate unwillingness of the clever people to frequent the fashionable and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it i wonder winsett broke off how a countess happens to live in our slum because she doesnt care a hang about where she livesor about any of our little social signposts said archer with a secret pride in his own picture of her hmbeen in bigger places i suppose the other commented well heres my corner he slouched off across broadway and archer stood looking after him and musing on his last words ned winsett had those flashes of penetration they were the most interesting thing about him and always made archer wonder why they had allowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are still struggling archer had known that winsett had a wife and child but he had never seen them the two men always met at the century or at some haunt of journalists and theatrical people such as the restaurant where winsett had proposed to go for a bock he had given archer to understand that his wife was an invalid which might be true of the poor lady or might merely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes or in both winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social observances archer who dressed in the evening because he thought it cleaner and more comfortable to do so and who had never stopped to consider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in a modest budget regarded winsetts attitude as part of the boring bohemian pose that always made fashionable people who changed their clothes without talking about it and were not forever harping on the number of servants one kept seem so much simpler and less selfconscious than the others nevertheless he was always stimulated by winsett and whenever he caught sight of the journalists lean bearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner and carry him off for a long talk winsett was not a journalist by choice he was a pure man of letters untimely born in a world that had no need of letters but after publishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations of which one hundred and twenty copies were sold thirty given away and the balance eventually destroyed by the publishers as per contract to make room for more marketable material he had abandoned his real calling and taken a subeditorial job on a womens weekly where fashionplates and paper patterns alternated with new england lovestories and advertisements of temperance drinks on the subject of hearthfires as the paper was called he was inexhaustibly entertaining but beneath his fun lurked the sterile bitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up his conversation always made archer take the measure of his own life and feel how little it contained but winsetts after all contained still less and though their common fund of intellectual interests and curiosities made their talks exhilarating their exchange of views usually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism the fact is life isnt much a fit for either of us winsett had once said im down and out nothing to be done about it ive got only one ware to produce and theres no market for it here and wont be in my time but youre free and youre welloff why dont you get into touch theres only one way to do it to go into politics archer threw his head back and laughed there one saw at a flash the unbridgeable difference between men like winsett and the othersarchers kind every one in polite circles knew that in america a gentleman couldnt go into politics but since he could hardly put it in that way to winsett he answered evasively look at the career of the honest man in american politics they dont want us whos they why dont you all get together and be they yourselves archers laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile it was useless to prolong the discussion everybody knew the melancholy fate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal or state politics in new york the day was past when that sort of thing was possible the country was in possession of the bosses and the emigrant and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture culture yesif we had it but there are just a few little local patches dying out here and there for lack ofwell hoeing and crossfertilising the last remnants of the old european tradition that your forebears brought with them but youre in a pitiful little minority youve got no centre no competition no audience youre like the pictures on the walls of a deserted house the portrait of a gentleman youll never amount to anything any of you till you roll up your sleeves and get right down into the muck that or emigrate god if i could emigrate archer mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back to books where winsett if uncertain was always interesting emigrate as if a gentleman could abandon his own country one could no more do that than one could roll up ones sleeves and go down into the muck a gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained but you couldnt make a man like winsett see that and that was why the new york of literary clubs and exotic restaurants though a first shake made it seem more of a kaleidoscope turned out in the end to be a smaller box with a more monotonous pattern than the assembled atoms of fifth avenue the next morning archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses in consequence of this search he arrived late at the office perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life why should he not be at that moment on the sands of st augustine with may welland no one was deceived by his pretense of professional activity in oldfashioned legal firms like that of which mr letterblair was the head and which were mainly engaged in the management of large estates and conservative investments there were always two or three young men fairly welloff and without professional ambition who for a certain number of hours of each day sat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks or simply reading the newspapers though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an occupation the crude fact of moneymaking was still regarded as derogatory and the law being a profession was accounted a more gentlemanly pursuit than business but none of these young men had much hope of really advancing in his profession or any earnest desire to do so and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was already perceptibly spreading it made archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too he had to be sure other tastes and interests he spent his vacations in european travel cultivated the clever people may spoke of and generally tried to keep up as he had somewhat wistfully put it to madame olenska but once he was married what would become of this narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived he had seen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream though perhaps less ardently and who had gradually sunk into the placid and luxurious routine of their elders from the office he sent a note by messenger to madame olenska asking if he might call that afternoon and begging her to let him find a reply at his club but at the club he found nothing nor did he receive any letter the following day this unexpected silence mortified him beyond reason and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of yellow roses behind a florists windowpane he left it there it was only on the third morning that he received a line by post from the countess olenska to his surprise it was dated from skuytercliff whither the van der luydens had promptly retreated after putting the duke on board his steamer i ran away the writer began abruptly without the usual preliminaries the day after i saw you at the play and these kind friends have taken me in i wanted to be quiet and think things over you were right in telling me how kind they were i feel myself so safe here i wish that you were with us she ended with a conventional yours sincerely and without any allusion to the date of her return the tone of the note surprised the young man what was madame olenska running away from and why did she feel the need to be safe his first thought was of some dark menace from abroad then he reflected that he did not know her epistolary style and that it might run to picturesque exaggeration women always exaggerated and moreover she was not wholly at her ease in english which she often spoke as if she were translating from the french je me suis evadee put in that way the opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have wanted to escape from a boring round of engagements which was very likely true for he judged her to be capricious and easily wearied of the pleasure of the moment it amused him to think of the van der luydens having carried her off to skuytercliff on a second visit and this time for an indefinite period the doors of skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to visitors and a chilly weekend was the most ever offered to the few thus privileged but archer had seen on his last visit to paris the delicious play of labiche le voyage de m perrichon and he remembered m perrichons dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the young man whom he had pulled out of the glacier the van der luydens had rescued madame olenska from a doom almost as icy and though there were many other reasons for being attracted to her archer knew that beneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on rescuing her he felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away and almost immediately remembered that only the day before he had refused an invitation to spend the following sunday with the reggie chiverses at their house on the hudson a few miles below skuytercliff he had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at highbank with coasting iceboating sleighing long tramps in the snow and a general flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes he had just received a box of new books from his london bookseller and had preferred the prospect of a quiet sunday at home with his spoils but he now went into the club writingroom wrote a hurried telegram and told the servant to send it immediately he knew that mrs reggie didnt object to her visitors suddenly changing their minds and that there was always a room to spare in her elastic house newland archer arrived at the chiverses on friday evening and on saturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a weekend at highbank in the morning he had a spin in the iceboat with his hostess and a few of the hardier guests in the afternoon he went over the farm with reggie and listened in the elaborately appointed stables to long and impressive disquisitions on the horse after tea he talked in a corner of the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself brokenhearted when his engagement was announced but was now eager to tell him of her own matrimonial hopes and finally about midnight he assisted in putting a goldfish in one visitors bed dressed up a burglar in the bathroom of a nervous aunt and saw in the small hours by joining in a pillowfight that ranged from the nurseries to the basement but on sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter and drove over to skuytercliff people had always been told that the house at skuytercliff was an italian villa those who had never been to italy believed it so did some who had the house had been built by mr van der luyden in his youth on his return from the grand tour and in anticipation of his approaching marriage with miss louisa dagonet it was a large square wooden structure with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and white a corinthian portico and fluted pilasters between the windows from the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by balustrades and urns descended in the steelengraving style to a small irregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers to the right and left the famous weedless lawns studded with specimen trees each of a different variety rolled away to long ranges of grass crested with elaborate castiron ornaments and below in a hollow lay the fourroomed stone house which the first patroon had built on the land granted him in 1612 against the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the italian villa loomed up rather grimly even in summer it kept its distance and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than thirty feet from its awful front now as archer rang the bell the long tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum and the surprise of the butler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he had been summoned from his final sleep happily archer was of the family and therefore irregular though his arrival was entitled to be informed that the countess olenska was out having driven to afternoon service with mrs van der luyden exactly three quarters of an hour earlier mr van der luyden the butler continued is in sir but my impression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading yesterdays evening post i heard him say sir on his return from church this morning that he intended to look through the evening post after luncheon if you like sir i might go to the library door and listen but archer thanking him said that he would go and meet the ladies and the butler obviously relieved closed the door on him majestically a groom took the cutter to the stables and archer struck through the park to the highroad the village of skuytercliff was only a mile and a half away but he knew that mrs van der luyden never walked and that he must keep to the road to meet the carriage presently however coming down a footpath that crossed the highway he caught sight of a slight figure in a red cloak with a big dog running ahead he hurried forward and madame olenska stopped short with a smile of welcome ah youve come she said and drew her hand from her muff the red cloak made her look gay and vivid like the ellen mingott of old days and he laughed as he took her hand and answered i came to see what you were running away from her face clouded over but she answered ah wellyou will see presently the answer puzzled him whydo you mean that youve been overtaken she shrugged her shoulders with a little movement like nastasias and rejoined in a lighter tone shall we walk on im so cold after the sermon and what does it matter now youre here to protect me the blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak ellenwhat is it you must tell me oh presentlylets run a race first my feet are freezing to the ground she cried and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the snow the dog leaping about her with challenging barks for a moment archer stood watching his gaze delighted by the flash of the red meteor against the snow then he started after her and they met panting and laughing at a wicket that led into the park she looked up at him and smiled i knew youd come that shows you wanted me to he returned with a disproportionate joy in their nonsense the white glitter of the trees filled the air with its own mysterious brightness and as they walked on over the snow the ground seemed to sing under their feet where did you come from madame olenska asked he told her and added it was because i got your note after a pause she said with a just perceptible chill in her voice may asked you to take care of me i didnt need any asking you meanim so evidently helpless and defenceless what a poor thing you must all think me but women here seem notseem never to feel the need any more than the blessed in heaven he lowered his voice to ask what sort of a need ah dont ask me i dont speak your language she retorted petulantly the answer smote him like a blow and he stood still in the path looking down at her what did i come for if i dont speak yours oh my friend she laid her hand lightly on his arm and he pleaded earnestly ellenwhy wont you tell me whats happened she shrugged again does anything ever happen in heaven he was silent and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a word finally she said i will tell youbut where where where one cant be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house with all the doors wide open and always a servant bringing tea or a log for the fire or the newspaper is there nowhere in an american house where one may be by ones self youre so shy and yet youre so public i always feel as if i were in the convent againor on the stage before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds ah you dont like us archer exclaimed they were walking past the house of the old patroon with its squat walls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central chimney the shutters stood wide and through one of the newlywashed windows archer caught the light of a fire whythe house is open he said she stood still no only for today at least i wanted to see it and mr van der luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened so that we might stop there on the way back from church this morning she ran up the steps and tried the door its still unlockedwhat luck come in and we can have a quiet talk mrs van der luyden has driven over to see her old aunts at rhinebeck and we shant be missed at the house for another hour he followed her into the narrow passage his spirits which had dropped at her last words rose with an irrational leap the homely little house stood there its panels and brasses shining in the firelight as if magically created to receive them a big bed of embers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney under an iron pot hung from an ancient crane rushbottomed armchairs faced each other across the tiled hearth and rows of delft plates stood on shelves against the walls archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers madame olenska dropping her cloak sat down in one of the chairs archer leaned against the chimney and looked at her youre laughing now but when you wrote me you were unhappy he said yes she paused but i cant feel unhappy when youre here i shant be here long he rejoined his lips stiffening with the effort to say just so much and no more no i know but im improvident i live in the moment when im happy the words stole through him like a temptation and to close his senses to it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black treeboles against the snow but it was as if she too had shifted her place and he still saw her between himself and the trees drooping over the fire with her indolent smile archers heart was beating insubordinately what if it were from him that she had been running away and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone together in this secret room ellen if im really a help to youif you really wanted me to cometell me whats wrong tell me what it is youre running away from he insisted he spoke without shifting his position without even turning to look at her if the thing was to happen it was to happen in this way with the whole width of the room between them and his eyes still fixed on the outer snow for a long moment she was silent and in that moment archer imagined her almost heard her stealing up behind him to throw her light arms about his neck while he waited soul and body throbbing with the miracle to come his eyes mechanically received the image of a heavilycoated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing along the path to the house the man was julius beaufort ah archer cried bursting into a laugh madame olenska had sprung up and moved to his side slipping her hand into his but after a glance through the window her face paled and she shrank back so that was it archer said derisively i didnt know he was here madame olenska murmured her hand still clung to archers but he drew away from her and walking out into the passage threw open the door of the house hallo beaufortthis way madame olenska was expecting you he said during his journey back to new york the next morning archer relived with a fatiguing vividness his last moments at skuytercliff beaufort though clearly annoyed at finding him with madame olenska had as usual carried off the situation highhandedly his way of ignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them if they were sensitive to it a feeling of invisibility of nonexistence archer as the three strolled back through the park was aware of this odd sense of disembodiment and humbling as it was to his vanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved beaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance but he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes it was fairly clear that madame olenska had not known that he was coming though her words to archer had hinted at the possibility at any rate she had evidently not told him where she was going when she left new york and her unexplained departure had exasperated him the ostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery the very night before of a perfect little house not in the market which was really just the thing for her but would be snapped up instantly if she didnt take it and he was loud in mockreproaches for the dance she had led him in running away just as he had found it if only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit nearer perfection i might have told you all this from town and been toasting my toes before the club fire at this minute instead of tramping after you through the snow he grumbled disguising a real irritation under the pretence of it and at this opening madame olenska twisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one day actually converse with each other from street to street or evenincredible dreamfrom one town to another this struck from all three allusions to edgar poe and jules verne and such platitudes as naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are talking against time and dealing with a new invention in which it would seem ingenuous to believe too soon and the question of the telephone carried them safely back to the big house mrs van der luyden had not yet returned and archer took his leave and walked off to fetch the cutter while beaufort followed the countess olenska indoors it was probable that little as the van der luydens encouraged unannounced visits he could count on being asked to dine and sent back to the station to catch the nine oclock train but more than that he would certainly not get for it would be inconceivable to his hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to spend the night and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with whom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as beaufort beaufort knew all this and must have foreseen it and his taking the long journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience he was undeniably in pursuit of the countess olenska and beaufort had only one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women his dull and childless home had long since palled on him and in addition to more permanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in his own set this was the man from whom madame olenska was avowedly flying the question was whether she had fled because his importunities displeased her or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist them unless indeed all her talk of flight had been a blind and her departure no more than a manoeuvre archer did not really believe this little as he had actually seen of madame olenska he was beginning to think that he could read her face and if not her face her voice and both had betrayed annoyance and even dismay at beauforts sudden appearance but after all if this were the case was it not worse than if she had left new york for the express purpose of meeting him if she had done that she ceased to be an object of interest she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of dissemblers a woman engaged in a love affair with beaufort classed herself irretrievably no it was worse a thousand times if judging beaufort and probably despising him she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her his habit of two continents and two societies his familiar association with artists and actors and people generally in the worlds eye and his careless contempt for local prejudices beaufort was vulgar he was uneducated he was purseproud but the circumstances of his life and a certain native shrewdness made him better worth talking to than many men morally and socially his betters whose horizon was bounded by the battery and the central park how should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it madame olenska in a burst of irritation had said to archer that he and she did not talk the same language and the young man knew that in some respects this was true but beaufort understood every turn of her dialect and spoke it fluently his view of life his tone his attitude were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in count olenskis letter this might seem to be to his disadvantage with count olenskis wife but archer was too intelligent to think that a young woman like ellen olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that reminded her of her past she might believe herself wholly in revolt against it but what had charmed her in it would still charm her even though it were against her will thus with a painful impartiality did the young man make out the case for beaufort and for beauforts victim a longing to enlighten her was strong in him and there were moments when he imagined that all she asked was to be enlightened that evening he unpacked his books from london the box was full of things he had been waiting for impatiently a new volume of herbert spencer another collection of the prolific alphonse daudets brilliant tales and a novel called middlemarch as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews he had declined three dinner invitations in favour of this feast but though he turned the pages with the sensuous joy of the booklover he did not know what he was reading and one book after another dropped from his hand suddenly among them he lit on a small volume of verse which he had ordered because the name had attracted him the house of life he took it up and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he had ever breathed in books so warm so rich and yet so ineffably tender that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary of human passions all through the night he pursued through those enchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of ellen olenska but when he woke the next morning and looked out at the brownstone houses across the street and thought of his desk in mr letterblairs office and the family pew in grace church his hour in the park of skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability as the visions of the night mercy how pale you look newland janey commented over the coffeecups at breakfast and his mother added newland dear ive noticed lately that youve been coughing i do hope youre not letting yourself be overworked for it was the conviction of both ladies that under the iron despotism of his senior partners the young mans life was spent in the most exhausting professional laboursand he had never thought it necessary to undeceive them the next two or three days dragged by heavily the taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth and there were moments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future he heard nothing of the countess olenska or of the perfect little house and though he met beaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the whisttables it was not till the fourth evening that he found a note awaiting him on his return home come late tomorrow i must explain to you ellen these were the only words it contained the young man who was dining out thrust the note into his pocket smiling a little at the frenchness of the to you after dinner he went to a play and it was not until his return home after midnight that he drew madame olenskas missive out again and reread it slowly a number of times there were several ways of answering it and he gave considerable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated night that on which when morning came he finally decided was to pitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was leaving that very afternoon for st augustine when archer walked down the sandy main street of st augustine to the house which had been pointed out to him as mr wellands and saw may welland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair he wondered why he had waited so long to come here was the truth here was reality here was the life that belonged to him and he who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary restraints had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what people might think of his stealing a holiday her first exclamation was newlandhas anything happened and it occurred to him that it would have been more feminine if she had instantly read in his eyes why he had come but when he answered yesi found i had to see you her happy blushes took the chill from her surprise and he saw how easily he would be forgiven and how soon even mr letterblairs mild disapproval would be smiled away by a tolerant family early as it was the main street was no place for any but formal greetings and archer longed to be alone with may and to pour out all his tenderness and his impatience it still lacked an hour to the late welland breakfasttime and instead of asking him to come in she proposed that they should walk out to an old orangegarden beyond the town she had just been for a row on the river and the sun that netted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its meshes across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered like silver wire and her eyes too looked lighter almost pale in their youthful limpidity as she walked beside archer with her long swinging gait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete to archers strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of the blue sky and the lazy river they sat down on a bench under the orangetrees and he put his arm about her and kissed her it was like drinking at a cold spring with the sun on it but his pressure may have been more vehement than he had intended for the blood rose to her face and she drew back as if he had startled her what is it he asked smiling and she looked at him with surprise and answered nothing a slight embarrassment fell on them and her hand slipped out of his it was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for their fugitive embrace in the beaufort conservatory and he saw that she was disturbed and shaken out of her cool boyish composure tell me what you do all day he said crossing his arms under his tiltedback head and pushing his hat forward to screen the sundazzle to let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of carrying on his own independent train of thought and he sat listening to her simple chronicle of swimming sailing and riding varied by an occasional dance at the primitive inn when a manofwar came in a few pleasant people from philadelphia and baltimore were picknicking at the inn and the selfridge merrys had come down for three weeks because kate merry had had bronchitis they were planning to lay out a lawn tennis court on the sands but no one but kate and may had racquets and most of the people had not even heard of the game all this kept her very busy and she had not had time to do more than look at the little vellum book that archer had sent her the week before the sonnets from the portuguese but she was learning by heart how they brought the good news from ghent to aix because it was one of the first things he had ever read to her and it amused her to be able to tell him that kate merry had never even heard of a poet called robert browning presently she started up exclaiming that they would be late for breakfast and they hurried back to the tumbledown house with its pointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where the wellands were installed for the winter mr wellands sensitive domesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel and at immense expense and in face of almost insuperable difficulties mrs welland was obliged year after year to improvise an establishment partly made up of discontented new york servants and partly drawn from the local african supply the doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home otherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any good she explained winter after winter to the sympathising philadelphians and baltimoreans and mr welland beaming across a breakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies was presently saying to archer you see my dear fellow we campwe literally camp i tell my wife and may that i want to teach them how to rough it mr and mrs welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by the young mans sudden arrival but it had occurred to him to explain that he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold and this seemed to mr welland an allsufficient reason for abandoning any duty you cant be too careful especially toward spring he said heaping his plate with strawcoloured griddlecakes and drowning them in golden syrup if id only been as prudent at your age may would have been dancing at the assemblies now instead of spending her winters in a wilderness with an old invalid oh but i love it here papa you know i do if only newland could stay i should like it a thousand times better than new york newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold said mrs welland indulgently and the young man laughed and said he supposed there was such a thing as ones profession he managed however after an exchange of telegrams with the firm to make his cold last a week and it shed an ironic light on the situation to know that mr letterblairs indulgence was partly due to the satisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had settled the troublesome matter of the olenski divorce mr letterblair had let mrs welland know that mr archer had rendered an invaluable service to the whole family and that old mrs manson mingott had been particularly pleased and one day when may had gone for a drive with her father in the only vehicle the place produced mrs welland took occasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughters presence im afraid ellens ideas are not at all like ours she was barely eighteen when medora manson took her back to europeyou remember the excitement when she appeared in black at her comingout ball another of medoras fadsreally this time it was almost prophetic that must have been at least twelve years ago and since then ellen has never been to america no wonder she is completely europeanised but european society is not given to divorce countess olenska thought she would be conforming to american ideas in asking for her freedom it was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since he had left skuytercliff and he felt the colour rise to his cheek mrs welland smiled compassionately that is just like the extraordinary things that foreigners invent about us they think we dine at two oclock and countenance divorce that is why it seems to me so foolish to entertain them when they come to new york they accept our hospitality and then they go home and repeat the same stupid stories archer made no comment on this and mrs welland continued but we do most thoroughly appreciate your persuading ellen to give up the idea her grandmother and her uncle lovell could do nothing with her both of them have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your influencein fact she said so to her grandmother she has an unbounded admiration for you poor ellenshe was always a wayward child i wonder what her fate will be what weve all contrived to make it he felt like answering if youd all of you rather she should be beauforts mistress than some decent fellows wife youve certainly gone the right way about it he wondered what mrs welland would have said if he had uttered the words instead of merely thinking them he could picture the sudden decomposure of her firm placid features to which a lifelong mastery over trifles had given an air of factitious authority traces still lingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughters and he asked himself if mays face was doomed to thicken into the same middleaged image of invincible innocence ah no he did not want may to have that kind of innocence the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience i verily believe mrs welland continued that if the horrible business had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husbands deathblow i dont know any of the details i only ask not to as i told poor ellen when she tried to talk to me about it having an invalid to care for i have to keep my mind bright and happy but mr welland was terribly upset he had a slight temperature every morning while we were waiting to hear what had been decided it was the horror of his girls learning that such things were possiblebut of course dear newland you felt that too we all knew that you were thinking of may im always thinking of may the young man rejoined rising to cut short the conversation he had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with mrs welland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage but he could think of no arguments that would move her and with a sense of relief he saw mr welland and may driving up to the door his only hope was to plead again with may and on the day before his departure he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the spanish mission the background lent itself to allusions to european scenes and may who was looking her loveliest under a widebrimmed hat that cast a shadow of mystery over her tooclear eyes kindled into eagerness as he spoke of granada and the alhambra we might be seeing it all this springeven the easter ceremonies at seville he urged exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger concession easter in seville and it will be lent next week she laughed why shouldnt we be married in lent he rejoined but she looked so shocked that he saw his mistake of course i didnt mean that dearest but soon after easterso that we could sail at the end of april i know i could arrange it at the office she smiled dreamily upon the possibility but he perceived that to dream of it sufficed her it was like hearing him read aloud out of his poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in real life oh do go on newland i do love your descriptions but why should they be only descriptions why shouldnt we make them real we shall dearest of course next year her voice lingered over it dont you want them to be real sooner cant i persuade you to break away now she bowed her head vanishing from him under her conniving hatbrim why should we dream away another year look at me dear dont you understand how i want you for my wife for a moment she remained motionless then she raised on him eyes of such despairing dearness that he halfreleased her waist from his hold but suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably im not sure if i do understand she said is itis it because youre not certain of continuing to care for me archer sprang up from his seat my godperhapsi dont know he broke out angrily may welland rose also as they faced each other she seemed to grow in womanly stature and dignity both were silent for a moment as if dismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words then she said in a low voice if that is itis there some one else some one elsebetween you and me he echoed her words slowly as though they were only halfintelligible and he wanted time to repeat the question to himself she seemed to catch the uncertainty of his voice for she went on in a deepening tone let us talk frankly newland sometimes ive felt a difference in you especially since our engagement has been announced dearwhat madness he recovered himself to exclaim she met his protest with a faint smile if it is it wont hurt us to talk about it she paused and added lifting her head with one of her noble movements or even if its true why shouldnt we speak of it you might so easily have made a mistake he lowered his head staring at the black leafpattern on the sunny path at their feet mistakes are always easy to make but if i had made one of the kind you suggest is it likely that i should be imploring you to hasten our marriage she looked downward too disturbing the pattern with the point of her sunshade while she struggled for expression yes she said at length you might wantonce for allto settle the question its one way her quiet lucidity startled him but did not mislead him into thinking her insensible under her hatbrim he saw the pallor of her profile and a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips well he questioned sitting down on the bench and looking up at her with a frown that he tried to make playful she dropped back into her seat and went on you mustnt think that a girl knows as little as her parents imagine one hears and one noticesone has ones feelings and ideas and of course long before you told me that you cared for me id known that there was some one else you were interested in every one was talking about it two years ago at newport and once i saw you sitting together on the verandah at a danceand when she came back into the house her face was sad and i felt sorry for her i remembered it afterward when we were engaged her voice had sunk almost to a whisper and she sat clasping and unclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade the young man laid his upon them with a gentle pressure his heart dilated with an inexpressible relief my dear childwas that it if you only knew the truth she raised her head quickly then there is a truth i dont know he kept his hand over hers i meant the truth about the old story you speak of but thats what i want to know newlandwhat i ought to know i couldnt have my happiness made out of a wrongan unfairnessto somebody else and i want to believe that it would be the same with you what sort of a life could we build on such foundations her face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like bowing himself down at her feet ive wanted to say this for a long time she went on ive wanted to tell you that when two people really love each other i understand that there may be situations which make it right that they shouldshould go against public opinion and if you feel yourself in any way pledged pledged to the person weve spoken of and if there is any way any way in which you can fulfill your pledge even by her getting a divorce newland dont give her up because of me his surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode so remote and so completely of the past as his loveaffair with mrs thorley rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view there was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox and if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in wonder at the prodigy of the wellands daughter urging him to marry his former mistress but he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the precipice they had skirted and full of a new awe at the mystery of younggirlhood for a moment he could not speak then he said there is no pledgeno obligation whateverof the kind you think such cases dont alwayspresent themselves quite as simply as but thats no matter i love your generosity because i feel as you do about those things i feel that each case must be judged individually on its own merits irrespective of stupid conventionalities i mean each womans right to her liberty he pulled himself up startled by the turn his thoughts had taken and went on looking at her with a smile since you understand so many things dearest cant you go a little farther and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another form of the same foolish conventionalities if theres no one and nothing between us isnt that an argument for marrying quickly rather than for more delay she flushed with joy and lifted her face to his as he bent to it he saw that her eyes were full of happy tears but in another moment she seemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and timorous girlhood and he understood that her courage and initiative were all for others and that she had none for herself it was evident that the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied composure betrayed and that at his first word of reassurance she had dropped back into the usual as a tooadventurous child takes refuge in its mothers arms archer had no heart to go on pleading with her he was too much disappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one deep look at him from her transparent eyes may seemed to be aware of his disappointment but without knowing how to alleviate it and they stood up and walked silently home your cousin the countess called on mother while you were away janey archer announced to her brother on the evening of his return the young man who was dining alone with his mother and sister glanced up in surprise and saw mrs archers gaze demurely bent on her plate mrs archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for being forgotten by it and newland guessed that she was slightly annoyed that he should be surprised by madame olenskas visit she had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons and a tiny green monkey muff i never saw her so stylishly dressed janey continued she came alone early on sunday afternoon luckily the fire was lit in the drawingroom she had one of those new cardcases she said she wanted to know us because youd been so good to her newland laughed madame olenska always takes that tone about her friends shes very happy at being among her own people again yes so she told us said mrs archer i must say she seems thankful to be here i hope you liked her mother mrs archer drew her lips together she certainly lays herself out to please even when she is calling on an old lady mother doesnt think her simple janey interjected her eyes screwed upon her brothers face its just my oldfashioned feeling dear may is my ideal said mrs archer ah said her son theyre not alike archer had left st augustine charged with many messages for old mrs mingott and a day or two after his return to town he called on her the old lady received him with unusual warmth she was grateful to him for persuading the countess olenska to give up the idea of a divorce and when he told her that he had deserted the office without leave and rushed down to st augustine simply because he wanted to see may she gave an adipose chuckle and patted his knee with her puffball hand ah ahso you kicked over the traces did you and i suppose augusta and welland pulled long faces and behaved as if the end of the world had come but little mayshe knew better ill be bound i hoped she did but after all she wouldnt agree to what id gone down to ask for wouldnt she indeed and what was that i wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in april whats the use of our wasting another year mrs manson mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic prudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids ask mamma i supposethe usual story ah these mingottsall alike born in a rut and you cant root em out of it when i built this house youd have thought i was moving to california nobody ever had built above fortieth streetno says i nor above the battery either before christopher columbus discovered america no no not one of them wants to be different theyre as scared of it as the smallpox ah my dear mr archer i thank my stars im nothing but a vulgar spicer but theres not one of my own children that takes after me but my little ellen she broke off still twinkling at him and asked with the casual irrelevance of old age now why in the world didnt you marry my little ellen archer laughed for one thing she wasnt there to be married noto be sure mores the pity and now its too late her life is finished she spoke with the coldblooded complacency of the aged throwing earth into the grave of young hopes the young mans heart grew chill and he said hurriedly cant i persuade you to use your influence with the wellands mrs mingott i wasnt made for long engagements old catherine beamed on him approvingly no i can see that youve got a quick eye when you were a little boy ive no doubt you liked to be helped first she threw back her head with a laugh that made her chins ripple like little waves ah heres my ellen now she exclaimed as the portieres parted behind her madame olenska came forward with a smile her face looked vivid and happy and she held out her hand gaily to archer while she stooped to her grandmothers kiss i was just saying to him my dear now why didnt you marry my little ellen madame olenska looked at archer still smiling and what did he answer oh my darling i leave you to find that out hes been down to florida to see his sweetheart yes i know she still looked at him i went to see your mother to ask where youd gone i sent a note that you never answered and i was afraid you were ill he muttered something about leaving unexpectedly in a great hurry and having intended to write to her from st augustine and of course once you were there you never thought of me again she continued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied assumption of indifference if she still needs me shes determined not to let me see it he thought stung by her manner he wanted to thank her for having been to see his mother but under the ancestresss malicious eye he felt himself tonguetied and constrained look at himin such hot haste to get married that he took french leave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees thats something like a loverthats the way handsome bob spicer carried off my poor mother and then got tired of her before i was weanedthough they only had to wait eight months for me but thereyoure not a spicer young man luckily for you and for may its only my poor ellen that has kept any of their wicked blood the rest of them are all model mingotts cried the old lady scornfully archer was aware that madame olenska who had seated herself at her grandmothers side was still thoughtfully scrutinising him the gaiety had faded from her eyes and she said with great gentleness surely granny we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes archer rose to go and as his hand met madame olenskas he felt that she was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter when can i see you he asked as she walked with him to the door of the room whenever you like but it must be soon if you want to see the little house again i am moving next week a pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the lowstudded drawingroom few as they had been they were thick with memories tomorrow evening she nodded tomorrow yes but early im going out the next day was a sunday and if she were going out on a sunday evening it could of course be only to mrs lemuel strutherss he felt a slight movement of annoyance not so much at her going there for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van der luydens but because it was the kind of house at which she was sure to meet beaufort where she must have known beforehand that she would meet himand where she was probably going for that purpose very well tomorrow evening he repeated inwardly resolved that he would not go early and that by reaching her door late he would either prevent her from going to mrs strutherss or else arrive after she had startedwhich all things considered would no doubt be the simplest solution it was only halfpast eight after all when he rang the bell under the wisteria not as late as he had intended by half an hourbut a singular restlessness had driven him to her door he reflected however that mrs strutherss sunday evenings were not like a ball and that her guests as if to minimise their delinquency usually went early the one thing he had not counted on in entering madame olenskas hall was to find hats and overcoats there why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine on a closer inspection of the garments besides which nastasia was laying his own his resentment gave way to curiosity the overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had ever seen under a polite roof and it took but a glance to assure himself that neither of them belonged to julius beaufort one was a shaggy yellow ulster of reachmedown cut the other a very old and rusty cloak with a capesomething like what the french called a macfarlane this garment which appeared to be made for a person of prodigious size had evidently seen long and hard wear and its greenishblack folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of prolonged sessions against barroom walls on it lay a ragged grey scarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape archer raised his eyebrows enquiringly at nastasia who raised hers in return with a fatalistic gia as she threw open the drawingroom door the young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room then with surprise he discovered another lady standing by the fire this lady who was long lean and loosely put together was clad in raiment intricately looped and fringed with plaids and stripes and bands of plain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing her hair which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading was surmounted by a spanish comb and black lace scarf and silk mittens visibly darned covered her rheumatic hands beside her in a cloud of cigarsmoke stood the owners of the two overcoats both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken off since morning in one of the two archer to his surprise recognised ned winsett the other and older who was unknown to him and whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the macfarlane had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair and moved his arms with large pawing gestures as though he were distributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude these three persons stood together on the hearthrug their eyes fixed on an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses with a knot of purple pansies at their base that lay on the sofa where madame olenska usually sat what they must have cost at this seasonthough of course its the sentiment one cares about the lady was saying in a sighing staccato as archer came in the three turned with surprise at his appearance and the lady advancing held out her hand dear mr archeralmost my cousin newland she said i am the marchioness manson archer bowed and she continued my ellen has taken me in for a few days i came from cuba where i have been spending the winter with spanish friendssuch delightful distinguished people the highest nobility of old castilehow i wish you could know them but i was called away by our dear great friend here dr carver you dont know dr agathon carver founder of the valley of love community dr carver inclined his leonine head and the marchioness continued ah new yorknew yorkhow little the life of the spirit has reached it but i see you do know mr winsett oh yesi reached him some time ago but not by that route winsett said with his dry smile the marchioness shook her head reprovingly how do you know mr winsett the spirit bloweth where it listeth listoh list interjected dr carver in a stentorian murmur but do sit down mr archer we four have been having a delightful little dinner together and my child has gone up to dress she expects you she will be down in a moment we were just admiring these marvellous flowers which will surprise her when she reappears winsett remained on his feet im afraid i must be off please tell madame olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our street this house has been an oasis ah but she wont abandon you poetry and art are the breath of life to her it is poetry you write mr winsett well no but i sometimes read it said winsett including the group in a general nod and slipping out of the room a caustic spiritun peu sauvage but so witty dr carver you do think him witty i never think of wit said dr carver severely ahahyou never think of wit how merciless he is to us weak mortals mr archer but he lives only in the life of the spirit and tonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently at mrs blenkers dr carver would there be time before you start for the blenkers to explain to mr archer your illuminating discovery of the direct contact but no i see it is nearly nine oclock and we have no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message dr carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion but having compared his ponderous gold timepiece with madame olenskas little travellingclock he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for departure i shall see you later dear friend he suggested to the marchioness who replied with a smile as soon as ellens carriage comes i will join you i do hope the lecture wont have begun dr carver looked thoughtfully at archer perhaps if this young gentleman is interested in my experiences mrs blenker might allow you to bring him with you oh dear friend if it were possiblei am sure she would be too happy but i fear my ellen counts on mr archer herself that said dr carver is unfortunatebut here is my card he handed it to archer who read on it in gothic characters agathon carver the valley of love kittasquattamy n y dr carver bowed himself out and mrs manson with a sigh that might have been either of regret or relief again waved archer to a seat ellen will be down in a moment and before she comes i am so glad of this quiet moment with you archer murmured his pleasure at their meeting and the marchioness continued in her low sighing accents i know everything dear mr archermy child has told me all you have done for her your wise advice your courageous firmnessthank heaven it was not too late the young man listened with considerable embarrassment was there any one he wondered to whom madame olenska had not proclaimed his intervention in her private affairs madame olenska exaggerates i simply gave her a legal opinion as she asked me to ah but in doing itin doing it you were the unconscious instrument ofofwhat word have we moderns for providence mr archer cried the lady tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids mysteriously little did you know that at that very moment i was being appealed to being approached in factfrom the other side of the atlantic she glanced over her shoulder as though fearful of being overheard and then drawing her chair nearer and raising a tiny ivory fan to her lips breathed behind it by the count himselfmy poor mad foolish olenski who asks only to take her back on her own terms good god archer exclaimed springing up you are horrified yes of course i understand i dont defend poor stanislas though he has always called me his best friend he does not defend himselfhe casts himself at her feet in my person she tapped her emaciated bosom i have his letter here a letterhas madame olenska seen it archer stammered his brain whirling with the shock of the announcement the marchioness manson shook her head softly timetime i must have time i know my ellenhaughty intractable shall i say just a shade unforgiving but good heavens to forgive is one thing to go back into that hell ah yes the marchioness acquiesced so she describes itmy sensitive child but on the material side mr archer if one may stoop to consider such things do you know what she is giving up those roses there on the sofaacres like them under glass and in the open in his matchless terraced gardens at nice jewelshistoric pearls the sobieski emeraldssablesbut she cares nothing for all these art and beauty those she does care for she lives for as i always have and those also surrounded her pictures priceless furniture music brilliant conversationah that my dear young man if youll excuse me is what youve no conception of here and she had it all and the homage of the greatest she tells me she is not thought handsome in new yorkgood heavens her portrait has been painted nine times the greatest artists in europe have begged for the privilege are these things nothing and the remorse of an adoring husband as the marchioness manson rose to her climax her face assumed an expression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved archers mirth had he not been numb with amazement he would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first sight of poor medora manson would have been in the guise of a messenger of satan but he was in no mood for laughing now and she seemed to him to come straight out of the hell from which ellen olenska had just escaped she knows nothing yetof all this he asked abruptly mrs manson laid a purple finger on her lips nothing directlybut does she suspect who can tell the truth is mr archer i have been waiting to see you from the moment i heard of the firm stand you had taken and of your influence over her i hoped it might be possible to count on your supportto convince you that she ought to go back i would rather see her dead cried the young man violently ah the marchioness murmured without visible resentment for a while she sat in her armchair opening and shutting the absurd ivory fan between her mittened fingers but suddenly she lifted her head and listened here she comes she said in a rapid whisper and then pointing to the bouquet on the sofa am i to understand that you prefer that mr archer after all marriage is marriage and my niece is still a wife what are you two plotting together aunt medora madame olenska cried as she came into the room she was dressed as if for a ball everything about her shimmered and glimmered softly as if her dress had been woven out of candlebeams and she carried her head high like a pretty woman challenging a roomful of rivals we were saying my dear that here was something beautiful to surprise you with mrs manson rejoined rising to her feet and pointing archly to the flowers madame olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet her colour did not change but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like summer lightning ah she exclaimed in a shrill voice that the young man had never heard who is ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet why a bouquet and why tonight of all nights i am not going to a ball i am not a girl engaged to be married but some people are always ridiculous she turned back to the door opened it and called out nastasia the ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared and archer heard madame olenska say in an italian that she seemed to pronounce with intentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it herethrow this into the dustbin and then as nastasia stared protestingly but noits not the fault of the poor flowers tell the boy to carry them to the house three doors away the house of mr winsett the dark gentleman who dined here his wife is illthey may give her pleasure the boy is out you say then my dear one run yourself here put my cloak over you and fly i want the thing out of the house immediately and as you live dont say they come from me she flung her velvet opera cloak over the maids shoulders and turned back into the drawingroom shutting the door sharply her bosom was rising high under its lace and for a moment archer thought she was about to cry but she burst into a laugh instead and looking from the marchioness to archer asked abruptly and you twohave you made friends its for mr archer to say darling he has waited patiently while you were dressing yesi gave you time enough my hair wouldnt go madame olenska said raising her hand to the heapedup curls of her chignon but that reminds me i see dr carver is gone and youll be late at the blenkers mr archer will you put my aunt in the carriage she followed the marchioness into the hall saw her fitted into a miscellaneous heap of overshoes shawls and tippets and called from the doorstep mind the carriage is to be back for me at ten then she returned to the drawingroom where archer on reentering it found her standing by the mantelpiece examining herself in the mirror it was not usual in new york society for a lady to address her parlourmaid as my dear one and send her out on an errand wrapped in her own operacloak and archer through all his deeper feelings tasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action followed on emotion with such olympian speed madame olenska did not move when he came up behind her and for a second their eyes met in the mirror then she turned threw herself into her sofacorner and sighed out theres time for a cigarette he handed her the box and lit a spill for her and as the flame flashed up into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said what do you think of me in a temper archer paused a moment then he answered with sudden resolution it makes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you i knew shed been talking about me well she said you were used to all kinds of thingssplendours and amusements and excitementsthat we could never hope to give you here madame olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips medora is incorrigibly romantic it has made up to her for so many things archer hesitated again and again took his risk is your aunts romanticism always consistent with accuracy you mean does she speak the truth her niece considered well ill tell you in almost everything she says theres something true and something untrue but why do you ask what has she been telling you he looked away into the fire and then back at her shining presence his heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening by that fireside and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry her away she saysshe pretends that count olenski has asked her to persuade you to go back to him madame olenska made no answer she sat motionless holding her cigarette in her halflifted hand the expression of her face had not changed and archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent incapacity for surprise you knew then he broke out she was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette she brushed it to the floor she has hinted about a letter poor darling medoras hints is it at your husbands request that she has arrived here suddenly madame olenska seemed to consider this question also there again one cant tell she told me she had had a spiritual summons whatever that is from dr carver im afraid shes going to marry dr carver poor medora theres always some one she wants to marry but perhaps the people in cuba just got tired of her i think she was with them as a sort of paid companion really i dont know why she came but you do believe she has a letter from your husband again madame olenska brooded silently then she said after all it was to be expected the young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace a sudden restlessness possessed him and he was tonguetied by the sense that their minutes were numbered and that at any moment he might hear the wheels of the returning carriage you know that your aunt believes you will go back madame olenska raised her head quickly a deep blush rose to her face and spread over her neck and shoulders she blushed seldom and painfully as if it hurt her like a burn many cruel things have been believed of me she said oh ellenforgive me im a fool and a brute she smiled a little you are horribly nervous you have your own troubles i know you think the wellands are unreasonable about your marriage and of course i agree with you in europe people dont understand our long american engagements i suppose they are not as calm as we are she pronounced the we with a faint emphasis that gave it an ironic sound archer felt the irony but did not dare to take it up after all she had perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs and after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that all he could do was to follow her lead but the sense of the waning hour made him desperate he could not bear the thought that a barrier of words should drop between them again yes he said abruptly i went south to ask may to marry me after easter theres no reason why we shouldnt be married then and may adores youand yet you couldnt convince her i thought her too intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions she is too intelligentshes not their slave madame olenska looked at him well theni dont understand archer reddened and hurried on with a rush we had a frank talkalmost the first she thinks my impatience a bad sign merciful heavensa bad sign she thinks it means that i cant trust myself to go on caring for her she thinks in short i want to marry her at once to get away from some one that icare for more madame olenska examined this curiously but if she thinks thatwhy isnt she in a hurry too because shes not like that shes so much nobler she insists all the more on the long engagement to give me time time to give her up for the other woman if i want to madame olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed eyes down the quiet street archer heard the approaching trot of her horses that is noble she said with a slight break in her voice yes but its ridiculous ridiculous because you dont care for any one else because i dont mean to marry any one else ah there was another long interval at length she looked up at him and asked this other womandoes she love you oh theres no other woman i mean the person that may was thinking of iswas never then why after all are you in such haste theres your carriage said archer she halfrose and looked about her with absent eyes her fan and gloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically yes i suppose i must be going youre going to mrs strutherss yes she smiled and added i must go where i am invited or i should be too lonely why not come with me archer felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him must make her give him the rest of her evening ignoring her question he continued to lean against the chimneypiece his eyes fixed on the hand in which she held her gloves and fan as if watching to see if he had the power to make her drop them may guessed the truth he said there is another womanbut not the one she thinks ellen olenska made no answer and did not move after a moment he sat down beside her and taking her hand softly unclasped it so that the gloves and fan fell on the sofa between them she started up and freeing herself from him moved away to the other side of the hearth ah dont make love to me too many people have done that she said frowning archer changing colour stood up also it was the bitterest rebuke she could have given him i have never made love to you he said and i never shall but you are the woman i would have married if it had been possible for either of us possible for either of us she looked at him with unfeigned astonishment and you say thatwhen its you whove made it impossible he stared at her groping in a blackness through which a single arrow of light tore its blinding way ive made it impossible you you you she cried her lip trembling like a childs on the verge of tears isnt it you who made me give up divorcinggive it up because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was how one must sacrifice ones self to preserve the dignity of marriage and to spare ones family the publicity the scandal and because my family was going to be your familyfor mays sake and for yoursi did what you told me what you proved to me that i ought to do ah she broke out with a sudden laugh ive made no secret of having done it for you she sank down on the sofa again crouching among the festive ripples of her dress like a stricken masquerader and the young man stood by the fireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving good god he groaned when i thought you thought ah dont ask me what i thought still looking at her he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck to her face she sat upright facing him with a rigid dignity i do ask you well then there were things in that letter you asked me to read my husbands letter yes i had nothing to fear from that letter absolutely nothing all i feared was to bring notoriety scandal on the familyon you and may good god he groaned again bowing his face in his hands the silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final and irrevocable it seemed to archer to be crushing him down like his own gravestone in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever lift that load from his heart he did not move from his place or raise his head from his hands his hidden eyeballs went on staring into utter darkness at least i loved you he brought out on the other side of the hearth from the sofacorner where he supposed that she still crouched he heard a faint stifled crying like a childs he started up and came to her side ellen what madness why are you crying nothings done that cant be undone im still free and youre going to be he had her in his arms her face like a wet flower at his lips and all their vain terrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise the one thing that astonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes arguing with her across the width of the room when just touching her made everything so simple she gave him back all his kiss but after a moment he felt her stiffening in his arms and she put him aside and stood up ah my poor newlandi suppose this had to be but it doesnt in the least alter things she said looking down at him in her turn from the hearth it alters the whole of life for me no noit mustnt it cant youre engaged to may welland and im married he stood up too flushed and resolute nonsense its too late for that sort of thing weve no right to lie to other people or to ourselves we wont talk of your marriage but do you see me marrying may after this she stood silent resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece her profile reflected in the glass behind her one of the locks of her chignon had become loosened and hung on her neck she looked haggard and almost old i dont see you she said at length putting that question to may do you he gave a reckless shrug its too late to do anything else you say that because its the easiest thing to say at this momentnot because its true in reality its too late to do anything but what wed both decided on ah i dont understand you she forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing it you dont understand because you havent yet guessed how youve changed things for me oh from the firstlong before i knew all youd done all id done yes i was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy of methat they thought i was a dreadful sort of person it seems they had even refused to meet me at dinner i found that out afterward and how youd made your mother go with you to the van der luydens and how youd insisted on announcing your engagement at the beaufort ball so that i might have two families to stand by me instead of one at that he broke into a laugh just imagine she said how stupid and unobservant i was i knew nothing of all this till granny blurted it out one day new york simply meant peace and freedom to me it was coming home and i was so happy at being among my own people that every one i met seemed kind and good and glad to see me but from the very beginning she continued i felt there was no one as kind as you no one who gave me reasons that i understood for doing what at first seemed so hard andunnecessary the very good people didnt convince me i felt theyd never been tempted but you knew you understood you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden handsand yet you hated the things it asks of one you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference that was what id never known beforeand its better than anything ive known she spoke in a low even voice without tears or visible agitation and each word as it dropped from her fell into his breast like burning lead he sat bowed over his head between his hands staring at the hearthrug and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her dress suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe she bent over him laying her hands on his shoulders and looking at him with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze ah dont let us undo what youve done she cried i cant go back now to that other way of thinking i cant love you unless i give you up his arms were yearning up to her but she drew away and they remained facing each other divided by the distance that her words had created then abruptly his anger overflowed and beaufort is he to replace me as the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of anger and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own but madame olenska only grew a shade paler and stood with her arms hanging down before her and her head slightly bent as her way was when she pondered a question hes waiting for you now at mrs strutherss why dont you go to him archer sneered she turned to ring the bell i shall not go out this evening tell the carriage to go and fetch the signora marchesa she said when the maid came after the door had closed again archer continued to look at her with bitter eyes why this sacrifice since you tell me that youre lonely ive no right to keep you from your friends she smiled a little under her wet lashes i shant be lonely now i was lonely i was afraid but the emptiness and the darkness are gone when i turn back into myself now im like a child going at night into a room where theres always a light her tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility and archer groaned out again i dont understand you yet you understand may he reddened under the retort but kept his eyes on her may is ready to give me up what three days after youve entreated her on your knees to hasten your marriage shes refused that gives me the right ah youve taught me what an ugly word that is she said he turned away with a sense of utter weariness he felt as though he had been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice and now just as he had fought his way to the top his hold had given way and he was pitching down headlong into darkness if he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her arguments but she still held him at a distance by something inscrutably aloof in her look and attitude and by his own awed sense of her sincerity at length he began to plead again if we do this now it will be worse afterwardworse for every one nonono she almost screamed as if he frightened her at that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house they had heard no carriage stopping at the door and they stood motionless looking at each other with startled eyes outside nastasias step crossed the hall the outer door opened and a moment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the countess olenska the lady was very happy at the flowers nastasia said smoothing her apron she thought it was her signor marito who had sent them and she cried a little and said it was a folly her mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope she tore it open and carried it to the lamp then when the door had closed again she handed the telegram to archer it was dated from st augustine and addressed to the countess olenska in it he read grannys telegram successful papa and mamma agree marriage after easter am telegraphing newland am too happy for words and love you dearly your grateful may half an hour later when archer unlocked his own frontdoor he found a similar envelope on the halltable on top of his pile of notes and letters the message inside the envelope was also from may welland and ran as follows parents consent wedding tuesday after easter at twelve grace church eight bridesmaids please see rector so happy love may archer crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate the news it contained then he pulled out a small pocketdiary and turned over the pages with trembling fingers but he did not find what he wanted and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the stairs a light was shining through the door of the little hallroom which served janey as a dressingroom and boudoir and her brother rapped impatiently on the panel the door opened and his sister stood before him in her immemorial purple flannel dressinggown with her hair on pins her face looked pale and apprehensive newland i hope theres no bad news in that telegram i waited on purpose in case no item of his correspondence was safe from janey he took no notice of her question look herewhat day is easter this year she looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance easter newland why of course the first week in april why the first week he turned again to the pages of his diary calculating rapidly under his breath the first week did you say he threw back his head with a long laugh for mercys sake whats the matter nothings the matter except that im going to be married in a month janey fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast oh newland how wonderful im so glad but dearest why do you keep on laughing do hush or youll wake mamma book ii the day was fresh with a lively spring wind full of dust all the old ladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing ermines and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered the faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar newland archer at a signal from the sexton had come out of the vestry and placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of grace church the signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was in sight but there was sure to be a considerable interval of adjustment and consultation in the lobby where the bridesmaids were already hovering like a cluster of easter blossoms during this unavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom in proof of his eagerness was expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled company and archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as through all the others which made of a nineteenth century new york wedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history everything was equally easyor equally painful as one chose to put itin the path he was committed to tread and he had obeyed the flurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms had obeyed his own in the days when he had guided them through the same labyrinth so far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations the bridesmaids eight bouquets of white lilac and liliesofthevalley had been sent in due time as well as the gold and sapphire sleevelinks of the eight ushers and the best mans catseye scarfpin archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording of his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and exladyloves the fees for the bishop and the rector were safely in the pocket of his best man his own luggage was already at mrs manson mingotts where the weddingbreakfast was to take place and so were the travelling clothes into which he was to change and a private compartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young couple to their unknown destinationconcealment of the spot in which the bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of the prehistoric ritual got the ring all right whispered young van der luyden newland who was inexperienced in the duties of a best man and awed by the weight of his responsibility archer made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make with his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey waistcoat and assured himself that the little gold circlet engraved inside newland to may april 187 was in its place then resuming his former attitude his tall hat and pearlgrey gloves with black stitchings grasped in his left hand he stood looking at the door of the church overhead handels march swelled pompously through the imitation stone vaulting carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at which with cheerful indifference he had stood on the same chancel step watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms how like a first night at the opera he thought recognising all the same faces in the same boxes no pews and wondering if when the last trump sounded mrs selfridge merry would be there with the same towering ostrich feathers in her bonnet and mrs beaufort with the same diamond earrings and the same smileand whether suitable proscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world after that there was still time to review one by one the familiar countenances in the first rows the womens sharp with curiosity and excitement the mens sulky with the obligation of having to put on their frockcoats before luncheon and fight for food at the weddingbreakfast too bad the breakfast is at old catherines the bridegroom could fancy reggie chivers saying but im told that lovell mingott insisted on its being cooked by his own chef so it ought to be good if one can only get at it and he could imagine sillerton jackson adding with authority my dear fellow havent you heard its to be served at small tables in the new english fashion archers eyes lingered a moment on the lefthand pew where his mother who had entered the church on mr henry van der luydens arm sat weeping softly under her chantilly veil her hands in her grandmothers ermine muff poor janey he thought looking at his sister even by screwing her head around she can see only the people in the few front pews and theyre mostly dowdy newlands and dagonets on the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved for the families he saw beaufort tall and redfaced scrutinising the women with his arrogant stare beside him sat his wife all silvery chinchilla and violets and on the far side of the ribbon lawrence leffertss sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the invisible deity of good form who presided at the ceremony archer wondered how many flaws leffertss keen eyes would discover in the ritual of his divinity then he suddenly recalled that he too had once thought such questions important the things that had filled his days seemed now like a nursery parody of life or like the wrangles of mediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever understood a stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be shown had darkened the last hours before the wedding and it seemed inconceivable to archer that grownup people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles and that the matter should have been decided in the negative by mrs wellands saying with indignant tears i should as soon turn the reporters loose in my house yet there was a time when archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with worldwide significance and all the while i suppose he thought real people were living somewhere and real things happening to them there they come breathed the best man excitedly but the bridegroom knew better the cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that mr brown the liverystable keeper gowned in black in his intermittent character of sexton was taking a preliminary survey of the scene before marshalling his forces the door was softly shut again then after another interval it swung majestically open and a murmur ran through the church the family mrs welland came first on the arm of her eldest son her large pink face was appropriately solemn and her plumcoloured satin with pale blue sidepanels and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet met with general approval but before she had settled herself with a stately rustle in the pew opposite mrs archers the spectators were craning their necks to see who was coming after her wild rumours had been abroad the day before to the effect that mrs manson mingott in spite of her physical disabilities had resolved on being present at the ceremony and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting character that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk up the nave and squeeze into a seat it was known that she had insisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of taking down the end panel of the front pew and to measure the space between the seat and the front but the result had been discouraging and for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the plan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel the idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the curbstone the idea of doing away with this awning and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas exceeded even old catherines courage though for a moment she had weighed the possibility why they might take a photograph of my child and put it in the papers mrs welland exclaimed when her mothers last plan was hinted to her and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder the ancestress had had to give in but her concession was bought only by the promise that the weddingbreakfast should take place under her roof though as the washington square connection said with the wellands house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere though all these transactions had been widely reported by the jacksons a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old catherine would appear in church and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature when she was found to have been replaced by her daughterinlaw mrs lovell mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies of her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress but once the disappointment occasioned by her motherinlaws nonappearance had subsided it was agreed that her black chantilly over lilac satin with a bonnet of parma violets formed the happiest contrast to mrs wellands blue and plumcolour far different was the impression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on mr mingotts arm in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and floating scarves and as this last apparition glided into view archers heart contracted and stopped beating he had taken it for granted that the marchioness manson was still in washington where she had gone some four weeks previously with her niece madame olenska it was generally understood that their abrupt departure was due to madame olenskas desire to remove her aunt from the baleful eloquence of dr agathon carver who had nearly succeeded in enlisting her as a recruit for the valley of love and in the circumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for the wedding for a moment archer stood with his eyes fixed on medoras fantastic figure straining to see who came behind her but the little procession was at an end for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats and the eight tall ushers gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby newlandi say shes here the best man whispered archer roused himself with a start a long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating for the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave the bishop the rector and two whitewinged assistants were hovering about the flowerbanked altar and the first chords of the spohr symphony were strewing their flowerlike notes before the bride archer opened his eyes but could they really have been shut as he imagined and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task the music the scent of the lilies on the altar the vision of the cloud of tulle and orangeblossoms floating nearer and nearer the sight of mrs archers face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs the low benedictory murmur of the rectors voice the ordered evolutions of the eight pink bridesmaids and the eight black ushers all these sights sounds and sensations so familiar in themselves so unutterably strange and meaningless in his new relation to them were confusedly mingled in his brain my god he thought have i got the ringand once more he went through the bridegrooms convulsive gesture then in a moment may was beside him such radiance streaming from her that it sent a faint warmth through his numbness and he straightened himself and smiled into her eyes dearly beloved we are gathered together here the rector began the ring was on her hand the bishops benediction had been given the bridesmaids were apoise to resume their place in the procession and the organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the mendelssohn march without which no newlywedded couple had ever emerged upon new york your armi say give her your arm young newland nervously hissed and once more archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the unknown what was it that had sent him there he wondered perhaps the glimpse among the anonymous spectators in the transept of a dark coil of hair under a hat which a moment later revealed itself as belonging to an unknown lady with a long nose so laughably unlike the person whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were becoming subject to hallucinations and now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave carried forward on the light mendelssohn ripples the spring day beckoning to them through widely opened doors and mrs wellands chestnuts with big white favours on their frontlets curvetting and showing off at the far end of the canvas tunnel the footman who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel wrapped mays white cloak about her and archer jumped into the brougham at her side she turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands clasped under her veil darling archer saidand suddenly the same black abyss yawned before him and he felt himself sinking into it deeper and deeper while his voice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully yes of course i thought id lost the ring no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a bridegroom didnt go through that but you did keep me waiting you know i had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen she surprised him by turning in full fifth avenue and flinging her arms about his neck but none ever can happen now can it newland as long as we two are together every detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the young couple after the weddingbreakfast had ample time to put on their travellingclothes descend the wide mingott stairs between laughing bridesmaids and weeping parents and get into the brougham under the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers and there was still half an hour left in which to drive to the station buy the last weeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers and settle themselves in the reserved compartment in which mays maid had already placed her dovecoloured travelling cloak and glaringly new dressingbag from london the old du lac aunts at rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal of the bridal couple with a readiness inspired by the prospect of spending a week in new york with mrs archer and archer glad to escape the usual bridal suite in a philadelphia or baltimore hotel had accepted with an equal alacrity may was enchanted at the idea of going to the country and childishly amused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where their mysterious retreat was situated it was thought very english to have a countryhouse lent to one and the fact gave a last touch of distinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant wedding of the year but where the house was no one was permitted to know except the parents of bride and groom who when taxed with the knowledge pursed their lips and said mysteriously ah they didnt tell us which was manifestly true since there was no need to once they were settled in their compartment and the train shaking off the endless wooden suburbs had pushed out into the pale landscape of spring talk became easier than archer had expected may was still in look and tone the simple girl of yesterday eager to compare notes with him as to the incidents of the wedding and discussing them as impartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher at first archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an inward tremor but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil unawareness she was alone for the first time with her husband but her husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday there was no one whom she liked as much no one whom she trusted as completely and the culminating lark of the whole delightful adventure of engagement and marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey like a grownup person like a married woman in fact it was wonderful thatas he had learned in the mission garden at st augustinesuch depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of imagination but he remembered how even then she had surprised him by dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience had been eased of its burden and he saw that she would probably go through life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as it came but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance perhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their transparency and her face the look of representing a type rather than a person as if she might have been chosen to pose for a civic virtue or a greek goddess the blood that ran so close to her fair skin might have been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element yet her look of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor dull but only primitive and pure in the thick of this meditation archer suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a stranger and plunged into a reminiscence of the weddingbreakfast and of granny mingotts immense and triumphant pervasion of it may settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject i was surprised thoughwerent youthat aunt medora came after all ellen wrote that they were neither of them well enough to take the journey i do wish it had been she who had recovered did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me he had known that the moment must come sooner or later but he had somewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay yesino yes it was beautiful he said looking at her blindly and wondering if whenever he heard those two syllables all his carefully builtup world would tumble about him like a house of cards arent you tired it will be good to have some tea when we arriveim sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready he rattled on taking her hand in his and her mind rushed away instantly to the magnificent tea and coffee service of baltimore silver which the beauforts had sent and which went so perfectly with uncle lovell mingotts trays and sidedishes in the spring twilight the train stopped at the rhinebeck station and they walked along the platform to the waiting carriage ah how awfully kind of the van der luydenstheyve sent their man over from skuytercliff to meet us archer exclaimed as a sedate person out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags im extremely sorry sir said this emissary that a little accident has occurred at the miss du lacs a leak in the watertank it happened yesterday and mr van der luyden who heard of it this morning sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the patroons house ready it will be quite comfortable i think youll find sir and the miss du lacs have sent their cook over so that it will be exactly the same as if youd been at rhinebeck archer stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more apologetic accents itll be exactly the same sir i do assure you and mays eager voice broke out covering the embarrassed silence the same as rhinebeck the patroons house but it will be a hundred thousand times betterwont it newland its too dear and kind of mr van der luyden to have thought of it and as they drove off with the maid beside the coachman and their shining bridal bags on the seat before them she went on excitedly only fancy ive never been inside ithave you the van der luydens show it to so few people but they opened it for ellen it seems and she told me what a darling little place it was she says its the only house shes seen in america that she could imagine being perfectly happy in wellthats what were going to be isnt it cried her husband gaily and she answered with her boyish smile ah its just our luck beginningthe wonderful luck were always going to have together of course we must dine with mrs carfry dearest archer said and his wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental britannia ware of their lodging house breakfasttable in all the rainy desert of autumnal london there were only two people whom the newland archers knew and these two they had sedulously avoided in conformity with the old new york tradition that it was not dignified to force ones self on the notice of ones acquaintances in foreign countries mrs archer and janey in the course of their visits to europe had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle and met the friendly advances of their fellowtravellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a foreigner other than those employed in hotels and railwaystations their own compatriotssave those previously known or properly accreditedthey treated with an even more pronounced disdain so that unless they ran across a chivers a dagonet or a mingott their months abroad were spent in an unbroken teteatete but the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing and one night at botzen one of the two english ladies in the room across the passage whose names dress and social situation were already intimately known to janey had knocked on the door and asked if mrs archer had a bottle of liniment the other ladythe intruders sister mrs carfryhad been seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis and mrs archer who never travelled without a complete family pharmacy was fortunately able to produce the required remedy mrs carfry was very ill and as she and her sister miss harle were travelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the archer ladies who supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid helped to nurse the invalid back to health when the archers left botzen they had no idea of ever seeing mrs carfry and miss harle again nothing to mrs archers mind would have been more undignified than to force ones self on the notice of a foreigner to whom one had happened to render an accidental service but mrs carfry and her sister to whom this point of view was unknown and who would have found it utterly incomprehensible felt themselves linked by an eternal gratitude to the delightful americans who had been so kind at botzen with touching fidelity they seized every chance of meeting mrs archer and janey in the course of their continental travels and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding out when they were to pass through london on their way to or from the states the intimacy became indissoluble and mrs archer and janey whenever they alighted at browns hotel found themselves awaited by two affectionate friends who like themselves cultivated ferns in wardian cases made macrame lace read the memoirs of the baroness bunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading london pulpits as mrs archer said it made another thing of london to know mrs carfry and miss harle and by the time that newland became engaged the tie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought only right to send a wedding invitation to the two english ladies who sent in return a pretty bouquet of pressed alpine flowers under glass and on the dock when newland and his wife sailed for england mrs archers last word had been you must take may to see mrs carfry newland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction but mrs carfry with her usual acuteness had run them down and sent them an invitation to dine and it was over this invitation that may archer was wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins its all very well for you newland you know them but i shall feel so shy among a lot of people ive never met and what shall i wear newland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her she looked handsomer and more dianalike than ever the moist english air seemed to have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight hardness of her virginal features or else it was simply the inner glow of happiness shining through like a light under ice wear dearest i thought a trunkful of things had come from paris last week yes of course i meant to say that i shant know which to wear she pouted a little ive never dined out in london and i dont want to be ridiculous he tried to enter into her perplexity but dont englishwomen dress just like everybody else in the evening newland how can you ask such funny questions when they go to the theatre in old balldresses and bare heads well perhaps they wear new balldresses at home but at any rate mrs carfry and miss harle wont theyll wear caps like my mothersand shawls very soft shawls yes but how will the other women be dressed not as well as you dear he rejoined wondering what had suddenly developed in her janeys morbid interest in clothes she pushed back her chair with a sigh thats dear of you newland but it doesnt help me much he had an inspiration why not wear your weddingdress that cant be wrong can it oh dearest if i only had it here but its gone to paris to be made over for next winter and worth hasnt sent it back oh well said archer getting up look herethe fogs lifting if we made a dash for the national gallery we might manage to catch a glimpse of the pictures the newland archers were on their way home after a three months weddingtour which may in writing to her girl friends vaguely summarised as blissful they had not gone to the italian lakes on reflection archer had not been able to picture his wife in that particular setting her own inclination after a month with the paris dressmakers was for mountaineering in july and swimming in august this plan they punctually fulfilled spending july at interlaken and grindelwald and august at a little place called etretat on the normandy coast which some one had recommended as quaint and quiet once or twice in the mountains archer had pointed southward and said theres italy and may her feet in a gentianbed had smiled cheerfully and replied it would be lovely to go there next winter if only you didnt have to be in new york but in reality travelling interested her even less than he had expected she regarded it once her clothes were ordered as merely an enlarged opportunity for walking riding swimming and trying her hand at the fascinating new game of lawn tennis and when they finally got back to london where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered his clothes she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she looked forward to sailing in london nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops and she found the theatres less exciting than the paris cafes chantants where under the blossoming horsechestnuts of the champs elysees she had had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant terrace on an audience of cocottes and having her husband interpret to her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears archer had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage it was less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat may exactly as all his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice the theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied there was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free and he had long since discovered that mays only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration her innate dignity would always keep her from making the gift abjectly and a day might even come as it once had when she would find strength to take it altogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good but with a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers such a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly outrageous in his own conduct and the fineness of her feeling for him made that unthinkable whatever happened he knew she would always be loyal gallant and unresentful and that pledged him to the practice of the same virtues all this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind if her simplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed and rebelled but since the lines of her character though so few were on the same fine mould as her face she became the tutelary divinity of all his old traditions and reverences such qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel though they made her so easy and pleasant a companion but he saw at once how they would fall into place in their proper setting he had no fear of being oppressed by them for his artistic and intellectual life would go on as it always had outside the domestic circle and within it there would be nothing small and stiflingcoming back to his wife would never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open and when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would be filled all these things went through his mind during their long slow drive from mayfair to south kensington where mrs carfry and her sister lived archer too would have preferred to escape their friends hospitality in conformity with the family tradition he had always travelled as a sightseer and lookeron affecting a haughty unconsciousness of the presence of his fellowbeings once only just after harvard he had spent a few gay weeks at florence with a band of queer europeanised americans dancing all night with titled ladies in palaces and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the fashionable club but it had all seemed to him though the greatest fun in the world as unreal as a carnival these queer cosmopolitan women deep in complicated loveaffairs which they appeared to feel the need of retailing to every one they met and the magnificent young officers and elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their confidences were too different from the people archer had grown up among too much like expensive and rather malodorous hothouse exotics to detain his imagination long to introduce his wife into such a society was out of the question and in the course of his travels no other had shown any marked eagerness for his company not long after their arrival in london he had run across the duke of st austrey and the duke instantly and cordially recognising him had said look me up wont youbut no properspirited american would have considered that a suggestion to be acted on and the meeting was without a sequel they had even managed to avoid mays english aunt the bankers wife who was still in yorkshire in fact they had purposely postponed going to london till the autumn in order that their arrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to these unknown relatives probably therell be nobody at mrs carfryslondons a desert at this season and youve made yourself much too beautiful archer said to may who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her skyblue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her to the london grime i dont want them to think that we dress like savages she replied with a scorn that pocahontas might have resented and he was struck again by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly american women for the social advantages of dress its their armour he thought their defence against the unknown and their defiance of it and he understood for the first time the earnestness with which may who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her hair to charm him had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and ordering her extensive wardrobe he had been right in expecting the party at mrs carfrys to be a small one besides their hostess and her sister they found in the long chilly drawingroom only another shawled lady a genial vicar who was her husband a silent lad whom mrs carfry named as her nephew and a small dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor pronouncing a french name as she did so into this dimlylit and dimfeatured group may archer floated like a swan with the sunset on her she seemed larger fairer more voluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her and he perceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an extreme and infantile shyness what on earth will they expect me to talk about her helpless eyes implored him at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was calling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms but beauty even when distrustful of itself awakens confidence in the manly heart and the vicar and the frenchnamed tutor were soon manifesting to may their desire to put her at her ease in spite of their best efforts however the dinner was a languishing affair archer noticed that his wifes way of showing herself at her ease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her references so that though her loveliness was an encouragement to admiration her conversation was a chill to repartee the vicar soon abandoned the struggle but the tutor who spoke the most fluent and accomplished english gallantly continued to pour it out to her until the ladies to the manifest relief of all concerned went up to the drawingroom the vicar after a glass of port was obliged to hurry away to a meeting and the shy nephew who appeared to be an invalid was packed off to bed but archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine and suddenly archer found himself talking as he had not done since his last symposium with ned winsett the carfry nephew it turned out had been threatened with consumption and had had to leave harrow for switzerland where he had spent two years in the milder air of lake leman being a bookish youth he had been entrusted to m riviere who had brought him back to england and was to remain with him till he went up to oxford the following spring and m riviere added with simplicity that he should then have to look out for another job it seemed impossible archer thought that he should be long without one so varied were his interests and so many his gifts he was a man of about thirty with a thin ugly face may would certainly have called him commonlooking to which the play of his ideas gave an intense expressiveness but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his animation his father who had died young had filled a small diplomatic post and it had been intended that the son should follow the same career but an insatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism then into authorship apparently unsuccessful and at lengthafter other experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listenerinto tutoring english youths in switzerland before that however he had lived much in paris frequented the goncourt grenier been advised by maupassant not to attempt to write even that seemed to archer a dazzling honour and had often talked with merimee in his mothers house he had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for and it was apparent that his literary ambitions had failed his situation in fact seemed materially speaking no more brilliant than ned winsetts but he had lived in a world in which as he said no one who loved ideas need hunger mentally as it was precisely of that love that poor winsett was starving to death archer looked with a sort of vicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so richly in his poverty you see monsieur its worth everything isnt it to keep ones intellectual liberty not to enslave ones powers of appreciation ones critical independence it was because of that that i abandoned journalism and took to so much duller work tutoring and private secretaryship there is a good deal of drudgery of course but one preserves ones moral freedom what we call in french ones quant a soi and when one hears good talk one can join in it without compromising any opinions but ones own or one can listen and answer it inwardly ah good conversationtheres nothing like it is there the air of ideas is the only air worth breathing and so i have never regretted giving up either diplomacy or journalismtwo different forms of the same selfabdication he fixed his vivid eyes on archer as he lit another cigarette voyezvous monsieur to be able to look life in the face thats worth living in a garret for isnt it but after all one must earn enough to pay for the garret and i confess that to grow old as a private tutoror a private anythingis almost as chilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at bucharest sometimes i feel i must make a plunge an immense plunge do you suppose for instance there would be any opening for me in americain new york archer looked at him with startled eyes new york for a young man who had frequented the goncourts and flaubert and who thought the life of ideas the only one worth living he continued to stare at m riviere perplexedly wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and advantages would be the surest hindrance to success new yorknew yorkbut must it be especially new york he stammered utterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could offer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only necessity a sudden flush rose under m rivieres sallow skin ii thought it your metropolis is not the intellectual life more active there he rejoined then as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of having asked a favour he went on hastily one throws out random suggestionsmore to ones self than to others in reality i see no immediate prospect and rising from his seat he added without a trace of constraint but mrs carfry will think that i ought to be taking you upstairs during the homeward drive archer pondered deeply on this episode his hour with m riviere had put new air into his lungs and his first impulse had been to invite him to dine the next day but he was beginning to understand why married men did not always immediately yield to their first impulses that young tutor is an interesting fellow we had some awfully good talk after dinner about books and things he threw out tentatively in the hansom may roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had read so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the key to them the little frenchman wasnt he dreadfully common she questioned coldly and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at having been invited out in london to meet a clergyman and a french tutor the disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment ordinarily defined as snobbishness but by old new yorks sense of what was due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands if mays parents had entertained the carfrys in fifth avenue they would have offered them something more substantial than a parson and a schoolmaster but archer was on edge and took her up commoncommon where he queried and she returned with unusual readiness why i should say anywhere but in his schoolroom those people are always awkward in society but then she added disarmingly i suppose i shouldnt have known if he was clever archer disliked her use of the word clever almost as much as her use of the word common but he was beginning to fear his tendency to dwell on the things he disliked in her after all her point of view had always been the same it was that of all the people he had grown up among and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible until a few months ago he had never known a nice woman who looked at life differently and if a man married it must necessarily be among the nice ahthen i wont ask him to dine he concluded with a laugh and may echoed bewildered goodnessask the carfrys tutor well not on the same day with the carfrys if you prefer i shouldnt but i did rather want another talk with him hes looking for a job in new york her surprise increased with her indifference he almost fancied that she suspected him of being tainted with foreignness a job in new york what sort of a job people dont have french tutors what does he want to do chiefly to enjoy good conversation i understand her husband retorted perversely and she broke into an appreciative laugh oh newland how funny isnt that french on the whole he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her refusing to take seriously his wish to invite m riviere another afterdinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of new york and the more archer considered it the less he was able to fit m riviere into any conceivable picture of new york as he knew it he perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many problems would be thus negatively solved for him but as he paid the hansom and followed his wifes long train into the house he took refuge in the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the most difficult in marriage after that i suppose we shall have pretty nearly finished rubbing off each others angles he reflected but the worst of it was that mays pressure was already bearing on the very angles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep the small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea the turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus and castiron vases painted in chocolate colour standing at intervals along the winding path that led to the sea looped their garlands of petunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel half way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house which was also chocolatecoloured but with the tin roof of the verandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning two large targets had been placed against a background of shrubbery on the other side of the lawn facing the targets was pitched a real tent with benches and gardenseats about it a number of ladies in summer dresses and gentlemen in grey frockcoats and tall hats stood on the lawn or sat upon the benches and every now and then a slender girl in starched muslin would step from the tent bow in hand and speed her shaft at one of the targets while the spectators interrupted their talk to watch the result newland archer standing on the verandah of the house looked curiously down upon this scene on each side of the shiny painted steps was a large blue china flowerpot on a bright yellow china stand a spiky green plant filled each pot and below the verandah ran a wide border of blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums behind him the french windows of the drawingrooms through which he had passed gave glimpses between swaying lace curtains of glassy parquet floors islanded with chintz poufs dwarf armchairs and velvet tables covered with trifles in silver the newport archery club always held its august meeting at the beauforts the sport which had hitherto known no rival but croquet was beginning to be discarded in favour of lawntennis but the latter game was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions and as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes the bow and arrow held their own archer looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle it surprised him that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions to it had so completely changed it was newport that had first brought home to him the extent of the change in new york during the previous winter after he and may had settled down in the new greenishyellow house with the bowwindow and the pompeian vestibule he had dropped back with relief into the old routine of the office and the renewal of this daily activity had served as a link with his former self then there had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey stepper for mays brougham the wellands had given the carriage and the abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library which in spite of family doubts and disapprovals had been carried out as he had dreamed with a dark embossed paper eastlake bookcases and sincere armchairs and tables at the century he had found winsett again and at the knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own set and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to dining out or entertaining friends at home with an occasional evening at the opera or the play the life he was living had still seemed a fairly real and inevitable sort of business but newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of unmitigated holidaymaking archer had tried to persuade may to spend the summer on a remote island off the coast of maine called appropriately enough mount desert where a few hardy bostonians and philadelphians were camping in native cottages and whence came reports of enchanting scenery and a wild almost trapperlike existence amid woods and waters but the wellands always went to newport where they owned one of the square boxes on the cliffs and their soninlaw could adduce no good reason why he and may should not join them there as mrs welland rather tartly pointed out it was hardly worth while for may to have worn herself out trying on summer clothes in paris if she was not to be allowed to wear them and this argument was of a kind to which archer had as yet found no answer may herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with so reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer she reminded him that he had always liked newport in his bachelor days and as this was indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to like it better than ever now that they were to be there together but as he stood on the beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly peopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to like it at all it was not mays fault poor dear if now and then during their travels they had fallen slightly out of step harmony had been restored by their return to the conditions she was used to he had always foreseen that she would not disappoint him and he had been right he had married as most young men did because he had met a perfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless sentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust and she had represented peace stability comradeship and the steadying sense of an unescapable duty he could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice for she had fulfilled all that he had expected it was undoubtedly gratifying to be the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married women in new york especially when she was also one of the sweetesttempered and most reasonable of wives and archer had never been insensible to such advantages as for the momentary madness which had fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage he had trained himself to regard it as the last of his discarded experiments the idea that he could ever in his senses have dreamed of marrying the countess olenska had become almost unthinkable and she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts but all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather empty and echoing place and he supposed that was one of the reasons why the busy animated people on the beaufort lawn shocked him as if they had been children playing in a graveyard he heard a murmur of skirts beside him and the marchioness manson fluttered out of the drawingroom window as usual she was extraordinarily festooned and bedizened with a limp leghorn hat anchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze and a little black velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over her much larger hatbrim my dear newland i had no idea that you and may had arrived you yourself came only yesterday you say ah businessbusinessprofessional duties i understand many husbands i know find it impossible to join their wives here except for the weekend she cocked her head on one side and languished at him through screwedup eyes but marriage is one long sacrifice as i used often to remind my ellen archers heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once before and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and the outer world but this break of continuity must have been of the briefest for he presently heard medora answering a question he had apparently found voice to put no i am not staying here but with the blenkers in their delicious solitude at portsmouth beaufort was kind enough to send his famous trotters for me this morning so that i might have at least a glimpse of one of reginas gardenparties but this evening i go back to rural life the blenkers dear original beings have hired a primitive old farmhouse at portsmouth where they gather about them representative people she drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim and added with a faint blush this week dr agathon carver is holding a series of inner thought meetings there a contrast indeed to this gay scene of worldly pleasurebut then i have always lived on contrasts to me the only death is monotony i always say to ellen beware of monotony its the mother of all the deadly sins but my poor child is going through a phase of exaltation of abhorrence of the world you know i suppose that she has declined all invitations to stay at newport even with her grandmother mingott i could hardly persuade her to come with me to the blenkers if you will believe it the life she leads is morbid unnatural ah if she had only listened to me when it was still possible when the door was still open but shall we go down and watch this absorbing match i hear your may is one of the competitors strolling toward them from the tent beaufort advanced over the lawn tall heavy too tightly buttoned into a london frockcoat with one of his own orchids in its buttonhole archer who had not seen him for two or three months was struck by the change in his appearance in the hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated and but for his erect squareshouldered walk he would have looked like an overfed and overdressed old man there were all sorts of rumours afloat about beaufort in the spring he had gone off on a long cruise to the west indies in his new steamyacht and it was reported that at various points where he had touched a lady resembling miss fanny ring had been seen in his company the steamyacht built in the clyde and fitted with tiled bathrooms and other unheardof luxuries was said to have cost him half a million and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his wife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are apt to be beauforts fortune was substantial enough to stand the strain and yet the disquieting rumours persisted not only in fifth avenue but in wall street some people said he had speculated unfortunately in railways others that he was being bled by one of the most insatiable members of her profession and to every report of threatened insolvency beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance the building of a new row of orchidhouses the purchase of a new string of racehorses or the addition of a new meissonnier or cabanel to his picturegallery he advanced toward the marchioness and newland with his usual halfsneering smile hullo medora did the trotters do their business forty minutes eh well thats not so bad considering your nerves had to be spared he shook hands with archer and then turning back with them placed himself on mrs mansons other side and said in a low voice a few words which their companion did not catch the marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks and a que voulezvous which deepened beauforts frown but he produced a good semblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at archer to say you know mays going to carry off the first prize ah then it remains in the family medora rippled and at that moment they reached the tent and mrs beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of mauve muslin and floating veils may welland was just coming out of the tent in her white dress with a pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat she had the same dianalike aloofness as when she had entered the beaufort ballroom on the night of her engagement in the interval not a thought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her heart and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both he marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from her she had her bow and arrow in her hand and placing herself on the chalkmark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and took aim the attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of appreciation followed her appearance and archer felt the glow of proprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary wellbeing her rivalsmrs reggie chivers the merry girls and divers rosy thorleys dagonets and mingotts stood behind her in a lovely anxious group brown heads and golden bent above the scores and pale muslins and flowerwreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow all were young and pretty and bathed in summer bloom but not one had the nymphlike ease of his wife when with tense muscles and happy frown she bent her soul upon some feat of strength gad archer heard lawrence lefferts say not one of the lot holds the bow as she does and beaufort retorted yes but thats the only kind of target shell ever hit archer felt irrationally angry his hosts contemptuous tribute to mays niceness was just what a husband should have wished to hear said of his wife the fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking in attraction was simply another proof of her quality yet the words sent a faint shiver through his heart what if niceness carried to that supreme degree were only a negation the curtain dropped before an emptiness as he looked at may returning flushed and calm from her final bullseye he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that curtain she took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the company with the simplicity that was her crowning grace no one could ever be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling that she would have been just as serene if she had missed them but when her eyes met her husbands her face glowed with the pleasure she saw in his mrs wellands basketwork ponycarriage was waiting for them and they drove off among the dispersing carriages may handling the reins and archer sitting at her side the afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and shrubberies and up and down bellevue avenue rolled a double line of victorias dogcarts landaus and visavis carrying welldressed ladies and gentlemen away from the beaufort gardenparty or homeward from their daily afternoon turn along the ocean drive shall we go to see granny may suddenly proposed i should like to tell her myself that ive won the prize theres lots of time before dinner archer acquiesced and she turned the ponies down narragansett avenue crossed spring street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond in this unfashionable region catherine the great always indifferent to precedent and thrifty of purse had built herself in her youth a manypeaked and crossbeamed cottageorne on a bit of cheap land overlooking the bay here in a thicket of stunted oaks her verandahs spread themselves above the islanddotted waters a winding drive led up between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of geraniums to a front door of highlyvarnished walnut under a striped verandahroof and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow starpatterned parquet floor upon which opened four small square rooms with heavy flockpapers under ceilings on which an italian housepainter had lavished all the divinities of olympus one of these rooms had been turned into a bedroom by mrs mingott when the burden of flesh descended on her and in the adjoining one she spent her days enthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window and perpetually waving a palmleaf fan which the prodigious projection of her bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set in motion stirred only the fringe of the antimacassars on the chairarms since she had been the means of hastening his marriage old catherine had shown to archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites toward the person served she was persuaded that irrepressible passion was the cause of his impatience and being an ardent admirer of impulsiveness when it did not lead to the spending of money she always received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of allusion to which may seemed fortunately impervious she examined and appraised with much interest the diamondtipped arrow which had been pinned on mays bosom at the conclusion of the match remarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought enough but that there was no denying that beaufort did things handsomely quite an heirloom in fact my dear the old lady chuckled you must leave it in fee to your eldest girl she pinched mays white arm and watched the colour flood her face well well what have i said to make you shake out the red flag aint there going to be any daughtersonly boys eh good gracious look at her blushing again all over her blushes whatcant i say that either mercy mewhen my children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out overhead i always say im too thankful to have somebody about me that nothing can shock archer burst into a laugh and may echoed it crimson to the eyes well now tell me all about the party please my dears for i shall never get a straight word about it out of that silly medora the ancestress continued and as may exclaimed cousin medora but i thought she was going back to portsmouth she answered placidly so she isbut shes got to come here first to pick up ellen ahyou didnt know ellen had come to spend the day with me such folderol her not coming for the summer but i gave up arguing with young people about fifty years ago ellenellen she cried in her shrill old voice trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn beyond the verandah there was no answer and mrs mingott rapped impatiently with her stick on the shiny floor a mulatto maidservant in a bright turban replying to the summons informed her mistress that she had seen miss ellen going down the path to the shore and mrs mingott turned to archer run down and fetch her like a good grandson this pretty lady will describe the party to me she said and archer stood up as if in a dream he had heard the countess olenskas name pronounced often enough during the year and a half since they had last met and was even familiar with the main incidents of her life in the interval he knew that she had spent the previous summer at newport where she appeared to have gone a great deal into society but that in the autumn she had suddenly sublet the perfect house which beaufort had been at such pains to find for her and decided to establish herself in washington there during the winter he had heard of her as one always heard of pretty women in washington as shining in the brilliant diplomatic society that was supposed to make up for the social shortcomings of the administration he had listened to these accounts and to various contradictory reports on her appearance her conversation her point of view and her choice of friends with the detachment with which one listens to reminiscences of some one long since dead not till medora suddenly spoke her name at the archery match had ellen olenska become a living presence to him again the marchionesss foolish lisp had called up a vision of the little firelit drawingroom and the sound of the carriagewheels returning down the deserted street he thought of a story he had read of some peasant children in tuscany lighting a bunch of straw in a wayside cavern and revealing old silent images in their painted tomb the way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was perched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows through their veil archer caught the glint of the lime rock with its whitewashed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic lighthouse keeper ida lewis was living her last venerable years beyond it lay the flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of goat island the bay spreading northward in a shimmer of gold to prudence island with its low growth of oaks and the shores of conanicut faint in the sunset haze from the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of pagodalike summerhouse and in the pagoda a lady stood leaning against the rail her back to the shore archer stopped at the sight as if he had waked from sleep that vision of the past was a dream and the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead was mrs wellands ponycarriage circling around and around the oval at the door was may sitting under the shameless olympians and glowing with secret hopes was the welland villa at the far end of bellevue avenue and mr welland already dressed for dinner and pacing the drawingroom floor watch in hand with dyspeptic impatiencefor it was one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is happening at a given hour what am i a soninlaw archer thought the figure at the end of the pier had not moved for a long moment the young man stood half way down the bank gazing at the bay furrowed with the coming and going of sailboats yachtlaunches fishingcraft and the trailing black coalbarges hauled by noisy tugs the lady in the summerhouse seemed to be held by the same sight beyond the grey bastions of fort adams a longdrawn sunset was splintering up into a thousand fires and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it beat out through the channel between the lime rock and the shore archer as he watched remembered the scene in the shaughraun and montague lifting ada dyass ribbon to his lips without her knowing that he was in the room she doesnt knowshe hasnt guessed shouldnt i know if she came up behind me i wonder he mused and suddenly he said to himself if she doesnt turn before that sail crosses the lime rock light ill go back the boat was gliding out on the receding tide it slid before the lime rock blotted out ida lewiss little house and passed across the turret in which the light was hung archer waited till a wide space of water sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the boat but still the figure in the summerhouse did not move he turned and walked up the hill im sorry you didnt find elleni should have liked to see her again may said as they drove home through the dusk but perhaps she wouldnt have caredshe seems so changed changed echoed her husband in a colourless voice his eyes fixed on the ponies twitching ears so indifferent to her friends i mean giving up new york and her house and spending her time with such queer people fancy how hideously uncomfortable she must be at the blenkers she says she does it to keep cousin medora out of mischief to prevent her marrying dreadful people but i sometimes think weve always bored her archer made no answer and she continued with a tinge of hardness that he had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice after all i wonder if she wouldnt be happier with her husband he burst into a laugh sancta simplicitas he exclaimed and as she turned a puzzled frown on him he added i dont think i ever heard you say a cruel thing before cruel wellwatching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a favourite sport of the angels but i believe even they dont think people happier in hell its a pity she ever married abroad then said may in the placid tone with which her mother met mr wellands vagaries and archer felt himself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands they drove down bellevue avenue and turned in between the chamfered wooden gateposts surmounted by castiron lamps which marked the approach to the welland villa lights were already shining through its windows and archer as the carriage stopped caught a glimpse of his fatherinlaw exactly as he had pictured him pacing the drawingroom watch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since found to be much more efficacious than anger the young man as he followed his wife into the hall was conscious of a curious reversal of mood there was something about the luxury of the welland house and the density of the welland atmosphere so charged with minute observances and exactions that always stole into his system like a narcotic the heavy carpets the watchful servants the perpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks the perpetually renewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table the whole chain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next and each member of the household to all the others made any less systematised and affluent existence seem unreal and precarious but now it was the welland house and the life he was expected to lead in it that had become unreal and irrelevant and the brief scene on the shore when he had stood irresolute halfway down the bank was as close to him as the blood in his veins all night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at mays side watching the moonlight slant along the carpet and thinking of ellen olenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind beauforts trotters a party for the blenkersthe blenkers mr welland laid down his knife and fork and looked anxiously and incredulously across the luncheontable at his wife who adjusting her gold eyeglasses read aloud in the tone of high comedy professor and mrs emerson sillerton request the pleasure of mr and mrs wellands company at the meeting of the wednesday afternoon club on august 25th at 3 oclock punctually to meet mrs and the misses blenker red gables catherine street r s v p good gracious mr welland gasped as if a second reading had been necessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him poor amy sillertonyou never can tell what her husband will do next mrs welland sighed i suppose hes just discovered the blenkers professor emerson sillerton was a thorn in the side of newport society and a thorn that could not be plucked out for it grew on a venerable and venerated family tree he was as people said a man who had had every advantage his father was sillerton jacksons uncle his mother a pennilow of boston on each side there was wealth and position and mutual suitability nothingas mrs welland had often remarkednothing on earth obliged emerson sillerton to be an archaeologist or indeed a professor of any sort or to live in newport in winter or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did but at least if he was going to break with tradition and flout society in the face he need not have married poor amy dagonet who had a right to expect something different and money enough to keep her own carriage no one in the mingott set could understand why amy sillerton had submitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the house with longhaired men and shorthaired women and when he travelled took her to explore tombs in yucatan instead of going to paris or italy but there they were set in their ways and apparently unaware that they were different from other people and when they gave one of their dreary annual gardenparties every family on the cliffs because of the sillertonpennilowdagonet connection had to draw lots and send an unwilling representative its a wonder mrs welland remarked that they didnt choose the cup race day do you remember two years ago their giving a party for a black man on the day of julia mingotts the dansant luckily this time theres nothing else going on that i know offor of course some of us will have to go mr welland sighed nervously some of us my dearmore than one three oclock is such a very awkward hour i have to be here at halfpast three to take my drops its really no use trying to follow bencombs new treatment if i dont do it systematically and if i join you later of course i shall miss my drive at the thought he laid down his knife and fork again and a flush of anxiety rose to his finelywrinkled cheek theres no reason why you should go at all my dear his wife answered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic i have some cards to leave at the other end of bellevue avenue and ill drop in at about halfpast three and stay long enough to make poor amy feel that she hasnt been slighted she glanced hesitatingly at her daughter and if newlands afternoon is provided for perhaps may can drive you out with the ponies and try their new russet harness it was a principle in the welland family that peoples days and hours should be what mrs welland called provided for the melancholy possibility of having to kill time especially for those who did not care for whist or solitaire was a vision that haunted her as the spectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist another of her principles was that parents should never at least visibly interfere with the plans of their married children and the difficulty of adjusting this respect for mays independence with the exigency of mr wellands claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity which left not a second of mrs wellands own time unprovided for of course ill drive with papaim sure newland will find something to do may said in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his lack of response it was a cause of constant distress to mrs welland that her soninlaw showed so little foresight in planning his days often already during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof when she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon he had answered paradoxically oh i think for a change ill just save it instead of spending it and once when she and may had had to go on a longpostponed round of afternoon calls he had confessed to having lain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house newland never seems to look ahead mrs welland once ventured to complain to her daughter and may answered serenely no but you see it doesnt matter because when theres nothing particular to do he reads a book ah yeslike his father mrs welland agreed as if allowing for an inherited oddity and after that the question of newlands unemployment was tacitly dropped nevertheless as the day for the sillerton reception approached may began to show a natural solicitude for his welfare and to suggest a tennis match at the chiverses or a sail on julius beauforts cutter as a means of atoning for her temporary desertion i shall be back by six you know dear papa never drives later than that and she was not reassured till archer said that he thought of hiring a runabout and driving up the island to a studfarm to look at a second horse for her brougham they had been looking for this horse for some time and the suggestion was so acceptable that may glanced at her mother as if to say you see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of us the idea of the studfarm and the brougham horse had germinated in archers mind on the very day when the emerson sillerton invitation had first been mentioned but he had kept it to himself as if there were something clandestine in the plan and discovery might prevent its execution he had however taken the precaution to engage in advance a runabout with a pair of old liverystable trotters that could still do their eighteen miles on level roads and at two oclock hastily deserting the luncheontable he sprang into the light carriage and drove off the day was perfect a breeze from the north drove little puffs of white cloud across an ultramarine sky with a bright sea running under it bellevue avenue was empty at that hour and after dropping the stablelad at the corner of mill street archer turned down the old beach road and drove across eastmans beach he had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which on halfholidays at school he used to start off into the unknown taking his pair at an easy gait he counted on reaching the studfarm which was not far beyond paradise rocks before three oclock so that after looking over the horse and trying him if he seemed promising he would still have four golden hours to dispose of as soon as he heard of the sillertons party he had said to himself that the marchioness manson would certainly come to newport with the blenkers and that madame olenska might again take the opportunity of spending the day with her grandmother at any rate the blenker habitation would probably be deserted and he would be able without indiscretion to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it he was not sure that he wanted to see the countess olenska again but ever since he had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted irrationally and indescribably to see the place she was living in and to follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the real one in the summerhouse the longing was with him day and night an incessant undefinable craving like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten he could not see beyond the craving or picture what it might lead to for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to madame olenska or to hear her voice he simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on and the way the sky and sea enclosed it the rest of the world might seem less empty when he reached the studfarm a glance showed him that the horse was not what he wanted nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to prove to himself that he was not in a hurry but at three oclock he shook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the byroads leading to portsmouth the wind had dropped and a faint haze on the horizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the saconnet on the turn of the tide but all about him fields and woods were steeped in golden light he drove past greyshingled farmhouses in orchards past hayfields and groves of oak past villages with white steeples rising sharply into the fading sky and at last after stopping to ask the way of some men at work in a field he turned down a lane between high banks of goldenrod and brambles at the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of the river to the left standing in front of a clump of oaks and maples he saw a long tumbledown house with white paint peeling from its clapboards on the roadside facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in which the new englander shelters his farming implements and visitors hitch their teams archer jumping down led his pair into the shed and after tying them to a post turned toward the house the patch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hayfield but to the left an overgrown boxgarden full of dahlias and rusty rosebushes encircled a ghostly summerhouse of trelliswork that had once been white surmounted by a wooden cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but continued to take ineffectual aim archer leaned for a while against the gate no one was in sight and not a sound came from the open windows of the house a grizzled newfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as the arrowless cupid it was strange to think that this place of silence and decay was the home of the turbulent blenkers yet archer was sure that he was not mistaken for a long time he stood there content to take in the scene and gradually falling under its drowsy spell but at length he roused himself to the sense of the passing time should he look his fill and then drive away he stood irresolute wishing suddenly to see the inside of the house so that he might picture the room that madame olenska sat in there was nothing to prevent his walking up to the door and ringing the bell if as he supposed she was away with the rest of the party he could easily give his name and ask permission to go into the sittingroom to write a message but instead he crossed the lawn and turned toward the boxgarden as he entered it he caught sight of something brightcoloured in the summerhouse and presently made it out to be a pink parasol the parasol drew him like a magnet he was sure it was hers he went into the summerhouse and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the silken thing and looked at its carved handle which was made of some rare wood that gave out an aromatic scent archer lifted the handle to his lips he heard a rustle of skirts against the box and sat motionless leaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands and letting the rustle come nearer without lifting his eyes he had always known that this must happen oh mr archer exclaimed a loud young voice and looking up he saw before him the youngest and largest of the blenker girls blonde and blowsy in bedraggled muslin a red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed to show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow and her halfawakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly graciouswhere did you drop from i must have been sound asleep in the hammock everybody else has gone to newport did you ring she incoherently enquired archers confusion was greater than hers inothat is i was just going to i had to come up the island to see about a horse and i drove over on a chance of finding mrs blenker and your visitors but the house seemed emptyso i sat down to wait miss blenker shaking off the fumes of sleep looked at him with increasing interest the house is empty mothers not here or the marchionessor anybody but me her glance became faintly reproachful didnt you know that professor and mrs sillerton are giving a gardenparty for mother and all of us this afternoon it was too unlucky that i couldnt go but ive had a sore throat and mother was afraid of the drive home this evening did you ever know anything so disappointing of course she added gaily i shouldnt have minded half as much if id known you were coming symptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her and archer found the strength to break in but madame olenskahas she gone to newport too miss blenker looked at him with surprise madame olenskadidnt you know shed been called away called away oh my best parasol i lent it to that goose of a katie because it matched her ribbons and the careless thing must have dropped it here we blenkers are all like that real bohemians recovering the sunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy dome above her head yes ellen was called away yesterday she lets us call her ellen you know a telegram came from boston she said she might be gone for two days i do love the way she does her hair dont you miss blenker rambled on archer continued to stare through her as though she had been transparent all he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its pinkness above her giggling head after a moment he ventured you dont happen to know why madame olenska went to boston i hope it was not on account of bad news miss blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity oh i dont believe so she didnt tell us what was in the telegram i think she didnt want the marchioness to know shes so romanticlooking isnt she doesnt she remind you of mrs scottsiddons when she reads lady geraldines courtship did you never hear her archer was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts his whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen he glanced about him at the unpruned garden the tumbledown house and the oakgrove under which the dusk was gathering it had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to have found madame olenska and she was far away and even the pink sunshade was not hers he frowned and hesitated you dont know i supposei shall be in boston tomorrow if i could manage to see her he felt that miss blenker was losing interest in him though her smile persisted oh of course how lovely of you shes staying at the parker house it must be horrible there in this weather after that archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they exchanged he could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that he should await the returning family and have high tea with them before he drove home at length with his hostess still at his side he passed out of range of the wooden cupid unfastened his horses and drove off at the turn of the lane he saw miss blenker standing at the gate and waving the pink parasol the next morning when archer got out of the fall river train he emerged upon a steaming midsummer boston the streets near the station were full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a shirtsleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of boarders going down the passage to the bathroom archer found a cab and drove to the somerset club for breakfast even the fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no excess of heat ever degrades the european cities caretakers in calico lounged on the doorsteps of the wealthy and the common looked like a pleasureground on the morrow of a masonic picnic if archer had tried to imagine ellen olenska in improbable scenes he could not have called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than this heatprostrated and deserted boston he breakfasted with appetite and method beginning with a slice of melon and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and scrambled eggs a new sense of energy and activity had possessed him ever since he had announced to may the night before that he had business in boston and should take the fall river boat that night and go on to new york the following evening it had always been understood that he would return to town early in the week and when he got back from his expedition to portsmouth a letter from the office which fate had conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table sufficed to justify his sudden change of plan he was even ashamed of the ease with which the whole thing had been done it reminded him for an uncomfortable moment of lawrence leffertss masterly contrivances for securing his freedom but this did not long trouble him for he was not in an analytic mood after breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the commercial advertiser while he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came in and the usual greetings were exchanged it was the same world after all though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the meshes of time and space he looked at his watch and finding that it was halfpast nine got up and went into the writingroom there he wrote a few lines and ordered a messenger to take a cab to the parker house and wait for the answer he then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to calculate how long it would take a cab to get to the parker house the lady was out sir he suddenly heard a waiters voice at his elbow and he stammered out as if it were a word in a strange language he got up and went into the hall it must be a mistake she could not be out at that hour he flushed with anger at his own stupidity why had he not sent the note as soon as he arrived he found his hat and stick and went forth into the street the city had suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a traveller from distant lands for a moment he stood on the doorstep hesitating then he decided to go to the parker house what if the messenger had been misinformed and she were still there he started to walk across the common and on the first bench under a tree he saw her sitting she had a grey silk sunshade over her headhow could he ever have imagined her with a pink one as he approached he was struck by her listless attitude she sat there as if she had nothing else to do he saw her drooping profile and the knot of hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat and the long wrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade he came a step or two nearer and she turned and looked at him ohshe said and for the first time he noticed a startled look on her face but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder and contentment ohshe murmured again on a different note as he stood looking down at her and without rising she made a place for him on the bench im here on businessjust got here archer explained and without knowing why he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her but what on earth are you doing in this wilderness he had really no idea what he was saying he felt as if he were shouting at her across endless distances and she might vanish again before he could overtake her i oh im here on business too she answered turning her head toward him so that they were face to face the words hardly reached him he was aware only of her voice and of the startling fact that not an echo of it had remained in his memory he had not even remembered that it was lowpitched with a faint roughness on the consonants you do your hair differently he said his heart beating as if he had uttered something irrevocable differently noits only that i do it as best i can when im without nastasia nastasia but isnt she with you no im alone for two days it was not worth while to bring her youre aloneat the parker house she looked at him with a flash of her old malice does it strike you as dangerous no not dangerous but unconventional i see i suppose it is she considered a moment i hadnt thought of it because ive just done something so much more unconventional the faint tinge of irony lingered in her eyes ive just refused to take back a sum of moneythat belonged to me archer sprang up and moved a step or two away she had furled her parasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel presently he came back and stood before her some onehas come here to meet you yes with this offer she nodded and you refusedbecause of the conditions i refused she said after a moment he sat down by her again what were the conditions oh they were not onerous just to sit at the head of his table now and then there was another interval of silence archers heart had slammed itself shut in the queer way it had and he sat vainly groping for a word he wants you backat any price wella considerable price at least the sum is considerable for me he paused again beating about the question he felt he must put it was to meet him here that you came she stared and then burst into a laugh meet himmy husband here at this season hes always at cowes or baden he sent some one yes with a letter she shook her head no just a message he never writes i dont think ive had more than one letter from him the allusion brought the colour to her cheek and it reflected itself in archers vivid blush why does he never write why should he what does one have secretaries for the young mans blush deepened she had pronounced the word as if it had no more significance than any other in her vocabulary for a moment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask did he send his secretary then but the remembrance of count olenskis only letter to his wife was too present to him he paused again and then took another plunge and the person the emissary the emissary madame olenska rejoined still smiling might for all i care have left already but he has insisted on waiting till this evening in case on the chance and you came out here to think the chance over i came out to get a breath of air the hotels too stifling im taking the afternoon train back to portsmouth they sat silent not looking at each other but straight ahead at the people passing along the path finally she turned her eyes again to his face and said youre not changed he felt like answering i was till i saw you again but instead he stood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park this is horrible why shouldnt we go out a little on the bay theres a breeze and it will be cooler we might take the steamboat down to point arley she glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went on on a monday morning there wont be anybody on the boat my train doesnt leave till evening im going back to new york why shouldnt we he insisted looking down at her and suddenly he broke out havent we done all we could ohshe murmured again she stood up and reopened her sunshade glancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene and assure herself of the impossibility of remaining in it then her eyes returned to his face you mustnt say things like that to me she said ill say anything you like or nothing i wont open my mouth unless you tell me to what harm can it do to anybody all i want is to listen to you he stammered she drew out a little goldfaced watch on an enamelled chain oh dont calculate he broke out give me the day i want to get you away from that man at what time was he coming her colour rose again at eleven then you must come at once you neednt be afraidif i dont come nor you eitherif you do i swear i only want to hear about you to know what youve been doing its a hundred years since weve metit may be another hundred before we meet again she still wavered her anxious eyes on his face why didnt you come down to the beach to fetch me the day i was at grannys she asked because you didnt look roundbecause you didnt know i was there i swore i wouldnt unless you looked round he laughed as the childishness of the confession struck him but i didnt look round on purpose on purpose i knew you were there when you drove in i recognised the ponies so i went down to the beach to get away from me as far as you could she repeated in a low voice to get away from you as far as i could he laughed out again this time in boyish satisfaction well you see its no use i may as well tell you he added that the business i came here for was just to find you but look here we must start or we shall miss our boat our boat she frowned perplexedly and then smiled oh but i must go back to the hotel first i must leave a note as many notes as you please you can write here he drew out a notecase and one of the new stylographic pens ive even got an envelopeyou see how everythings predestined theresteady the thing on your knee and ill get the pen going in a second they have to be humoured wait he banged the hand that held the pen against the back of the bench its like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer just a trick now try she laughed and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on his notecase began to write archer walked away a few steps staring with radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby who in their turn paused to stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionablydressed lady writing a note on her knee on a bench in the common madame olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope wrote a name on it and put it into her pocket then she too stood up they walked back toward beacon street and near the club archer caught sight of the plushlined herdic which had carried his note to the parker house and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing his brow at the corner hydrant i told you everything was predestined heres a cab for us you see they laughed astonished at the miracle of picking up a public conveyance at that hour and in that unlikely spot in a city where cabstands were still a foreign novelty archer looking at his watch saw that there was time to drive to the parker house before going to the steamboat landing they rattled through the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel archer held out his hand for the letter shall i take it in he asked but madame olenska shaking her head sprang out and disappeared through the glazed doors it was barely halfpast ten but what if the emissary impatient for her reply and not knowing how else to employ his time were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks at their elbows of whom archer had caught a glimpse as she went in he waited pacing up and down before the herdic a sicilian youth with eyes like nastasias offered to shine his boots and an irish matron to sell him peaches and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot men with straw hats tilted far back who glanced at him as they went by he marvelled that the door should open so often and that all the people it let out should look so like each other and so like all the other hot men who at that hour through the length and breadth of the land were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of hotels and then suddenly came a face that he could not relate to the other faces he caught but a flash of it for his pacings had carried him to the farthest point of his beat and it was in turning back to the hotel that he saw in a group of typical countenancesthe lank and weary the round and surprised the lanternjawed and mildthis other face that was so many more things at once and things so different it was that of a young man pale too and halfextinguished by the heat or worry or both but somehow quicker vivider more conscious or perhaps seeming so because he was so different archer hung a moment on a thin thread of memory but it snapped and floated off with the disappearing faceapparently that of some foreign business man looking doubly foreign in such a setting he vanished in the stream of passersby and archer resumed his patrol he did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel and his unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that if madame olenska was so long in reappearing it could only be because she had met the emissary and been waylaid by him at the thought archers apprehension rose to anguish if she doesnt come soon ill go in and find her he said the doors swung open again and she was at his side they got into the herdic and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had been absent just three minutes in the clatter of loose windows that made talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to the wharf seated side by side on a bench of the halfempty boat they found that they had hardly anything to say to each other or rather that what they had to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their release and their isolation as the paddlewheels began to turn and wharves and shipping to recede through the veil of heat it seemed to archer that everything in the old familiar world of habit was receding also he longed to ask madame olenska if she did not have the same feeling the feeling that they were starting on some long voyage from which they might never return but he was afraid to say it or anything else that might disturb the delicate balance of her trust in him in reality he had no wish to betray that trust there had been days and nights when the memory of their kiss had burned and burned on his lips the day before even on the drive to portsmouth the thought of her had run through him like fire but now that she was beside him and they were drifting forth into this unknown world they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper nearness that a touch may sunder as the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about them and the bay broke up into long oily undulations then into ripples tipped with spray the fog of sultriness still hung over the city but ahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters and distant promontories with lighthouses in the sun madame olenska leaning back against the boatrail drank in the coolness between parted lips she had wound a long veil about her hat but it left her face uncovered and archer was struck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression she seemed to take their adventure as a matter of course and to be neither in fear of unexpected encounters nor what was worse unduly elated by their possibility in the bare diningroom of the inn which he had hoped they would have to themselves they found a strident party of innocentlooking young men and womenschoolteachers on a holiday the landlord told themand archers heart sank at the idea of having to talk through their noise this is hopelessill ask for a private room he said and madame olenska without offering any objection waited while he went in search of it the room opened on a long wooden verandah with the sea coming in at the windows it was bare and cool with a table covered with a coarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a blueberry pie under a cage no more guilelesslooking cabinet particulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple archer fancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile with which madame olenska sat down opposite to him a woman who had run away from her husbandand reputedly with another manwas likely to have mastered the art of taking things for granted but something in the quality of her composure took the edge from his irony by being so quiet so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the conventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural thing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other they lunched slowly and meditatively with mute intervals between rushes of talk for the spell once broken they had much to say and yet moments when saying became the mere accompaniment to long duologues of silence archer kept the talk from his own affairs not with conscious intention but because he did not want to miss a word of her history and leaning on the table her chin resting on her clasped hands she talked to him of the year and a half since they had met she had grown tired of what people called society new york was kind it was almost oppressively hospitable she should never forget the way in which it had welcomed her back but after the first flush of novelty she had found herself as she phrased it too different to care for the things it cared aboutand so she had decided to try washington where one was supposed to meet more varieties of people and of opinion and on the whole she should probably settle down in washington and make a home there for poor medora who had worn out the patience of all her other relations just at the time when she most needed looking after and protecting from matrimonial perils but dr carverarent you afraid of dr carver i hear hes been staying with you at the blenkers she smiled oh the carver danger is over dr carver is a very clever man he wants a rich wife to finance his plans and medora is simply a good advertisement as a convert a convert to what to all sorts of new and crazy social schemes but do you know they interest me more than the blind conformity to traditionsomebody elses traditionthat i see among our own friends it seems stupid to have discovered america only to make it into a copy of another country she smiled across the table do you suppose christopher columbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the opera with the selfridge merrys archer changed colour and beaufortdo you say these things to beaufort he asked abruptly i havent seen him for a long time but i used to and he understands ah its what ive always told you you dont like us and you like beaufort because hes so unlike us he looked about the bare room and out at the bare beach and the row of stark white village houses strung along the shore were damnably dull weve no character no colour no varietyi wonder he broke out why you dont go back her eyes darkened and he expected an indignant rejoinder but she sat silent as if thinking over what he had said and he grew frightened lest she should answer that she wondered too at length she said i believe its because of you it was impossible to make the confession more dispassionately or in a tone less encouraging to the vanity of the person addressed archer reddened to the temples but dared not move or speak it was as if her words had been some rare butterfly that the least motion might drive off on startled wings but that might gather a flock about it if it were left undisturbed at least she continued it was you who made me understand that under the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate that even those i most cared for in my other life look cheap in comparison i dont know how to explain myselfshe drew together her troubled browsbut it seems as if id never before understood with how much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures may be paid exquisite pleasuresits something to have had them he felt like retorting but the appeal in her eyes kept him silent i want she went on to be perfectly honest with youand with myself for a long time ive hoped this chance would come that i might tell you how youve helped me what youve made of me archer sat staring beneath frowning brows he interrupted her with a laugh and what do you make out that youve made of me she paled a little of you yes for im of your making much more than you ever were of mine im the man who married one woman because another one told him to her paleness turned to a fugitive flush i thoughtyou promisedyou were not to say such things today ahhow like a woman none of you will ever see a bad business through she lowered her voice is it a bad businessfor may he stood in the window drumming against the raised sash and feeling in every fibre the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her cousins name for thats the thing weve always got to think ofhavent weby your own showing she insisted my own showing he echoed his blank eyes still on the sea or if not she continued pursuing her own thought with a painful application if its not worth while to have given up to have missed things so that others may be saved from disillusionment and miserythen everything i came home for everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of themall these things are a sham or a dream he turned around without moving from his place and in that case theres no reason on earth why you shouldnt go back he concluded for her her eyes were clinging to him desperately oh is there no reason not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage my marriage he said savagely isnt going to be a sight to keep you here she made no answer and he went on whats the use you gave me my first glimpse of a real life and at the same moment you asked me to go on with a sham one its beyond human enduringthats all oh dont say that when im enduring it she burst out her eyes filling her arms had dropped along the table and she sat with her face abandoned to his gaze as if in the recklessness of a desperate peril the face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person with the soul behind it archer stood dumb overwhelmed by what it suddenly told him you toooh all this time you too for answer she let the tears on her lids overflow and run slowly downward half the width of the room was still between them and neither made any show of moving archer was conscious of a curious indifference to her bodily presence he would hardly have been aware of it if one of the hands she had flung out on the table had not drawn his gaze as on the occasion when in the little twentythird street house he had kept his eye on it in order not to look at her face now his imagination spun about the hand as about the edge of a vortex but still he made no effort to draw nearer he had known the love that is fed on caresses and feeds them but this passion that was closer than his bones was not to be superficially satisfied his one terror was to do anything which might efface the sound and impression of her words his one thought that he should never again feel quite alone but after a moment the sense of waste and ruin overcame him there they were close together and safe and shut in yet so chained to their separate destinies that they might as well have been half the world apart whats the usewhen you will go back he broke out a great hopeless how on earth can i keep you crying out to her beneath his words she sat motionless with lowered lids ohi shant go yet not yet some time then some time that you already foresee at that she raised her clearest eyes i promise you not as long as you hold out not as long as we can look straight at each other like this he dropped into his chair what her answer really said was if you lift a finger youll drive me back back to all the abominations you know of and all the temptations you half guess he understood it as clearly as if she had uttered the words and the thought kept him anchored to his side of the table in a kind of moved and sacred submission what a life for you he groaned ohas long as its a part of yours and mine a part of yours she nodded and thats to be allfor either of us well it is all isnt it at that he sprang up forgetting everything but the sweetness of her face she rose too not as if to meet him or to flee from him but quietly as though the worst of the task were done and she had only to wait so quietly that as he came close her outstretched hands acted not as a check but as a guide to him they fell into his while her arms extended but not rigid kept him far enough off to let her surrendered face say the rest they may have stood in that way for a long time or only for a few moments but it was long enough for her silence to communicate all she had to say and for him to feel that only one thing mattered he must do nothing to make this meeting their last he must leave their future in her care asking only that she should keep fast hold of it dontdont be unhappy she said with a break in her voice as she drew her hands away and he answered you wont go backyou wont go back as if it were the one possibility he could not bear i wont go back she said and turning away she opened the door and led the way into the public diningroom the strident schoolteachers were gathering up their possessions preparatory to a straggling flight to the wharf across the beach lay the white steamboat at the pier and over the sunlit waters boston loomed in a line of haze once more on the boat and in the presence of others archer felt a tranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him the day according to any current valuation had been a rather ridiculous failure he had not so much as touched madame olenskas hand with his lips or extracted one word from her that gave promise of farther opportunities nevertheless for a man sick with unsatisfied love and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his passion he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted it was the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others and their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet tranquillized him a balance not artfully calculated as her tears and her falterings showed but resulting naturally from her unabashed sincerity it filled him with a tender awe now the danger was over and made him thank the fates that no personal vanity no sense of playing a part before sophisticated witnesses had tempted him to tempt her even after they had clasped hands for goodbye at the fall river station and he had turned away alone the conviction remained with him of having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed he wandered back to the club and went and sat alone in the deserted library turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second of their hours together it was clear to him and it grew more clear under closer scrutiny that if she should finally decide on returning to europereturning to her husbandit would not be because her old life tempted her even on the new terms offered no she would go only if she felt herself becoming a temptation to archer a temptation to fall away from the standard they had both set up her choice would be to stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer and it depended on himself to keep her just there safe but secluded in the train these thoughts were still with him they enclosed him in a kind of golden haze through which the faces about him looked remote and indistinct he had a feeling that if he spoke to his fellowtravellers they would not understand what he was saying in this state of abstraction he found himself the following morning waking to the reality of a stifling september day in new york the heatwithered faces in the long train streamed past him and he continued to stare at them through the same golden blur but suddenly as he left the station one of the faces detached itself came closer and forced itself upon his consciousness it was as he instantly recalled the face of the young man he had seen the day before passing out of the parker house and had noted as not conforming to type as not having an american hotel face the same thing struck him now and again he became aware of a dim stir of former associations the young man stood looking about him with the dazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of american travel then he advanced toward archer lifted his hat and said in english surely monsieur we met in london ah to be sure in london archer grasped his hand with curiosity and sympathy so you did get here after all he exclaimed casting a wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young carfrys french tutor oh i got hereyes m riviere smiled with drawn lips but not for long i return the day after tomorrow he stood grasping his light valise in one neatly gloved hand and gazing anxiously perplexedly almost appealingly into archers face i wonder monsieur since ive had the good luck to run across you if i might i was just going to suggest it come to luncheon wont you down town i mean if youll look me up in my office ill take you to a very decent restaurant in that quarter m riviere was visibly touched and surprised youre too kind but i was only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of conveyance there are no porters and no one here seems to listen i know our american stations must surprise you when you ask for a porter they give you chewinggum but if youll come along ill extricate you and you must really lunch with me you know the young man after a just perceptible hesitation replied with profuse thanks and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction that he was already engaged but when they had reached the comparative reassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon archer at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office fixed an hour and scribbled his address which the frenchman pocketed with reiterated thanks and a wide flourish of his hat a horsecar received him and archer walked away punctually at the hour m riviere appeared shaved smoothedout but still unmistakably drawn and serious archer was alone in his office and the young man before accepting the seat he proffered began abruptly i believe i saw you sir yesterday in boston the statement was insignificant enough and archer was about to frame an assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet illuminating in his visitors insistent gaze it is extraordinary very extraordinary m riviere continued that we should have met in the circumstances in which i find myself what circumstances archer asked wondering a little crudely if he needed money m riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes i have come not to look for employment as i spoke of doing when we last met but on a special mission ah archer exclaimed in a flash the two meetings had connected themselves in his mind he paused to take in the situation thus suddenly lighted up for him and m riviere also remained silent as if aware that what he had said was enough a special mission archer at length repeated the young frenchman opening his palms raised them slightly and the two men continued to look at each other across the officedesk till archer roused himself to say do sit down whereupon m riviere bowed took a distant chair and again waited it was about this mission that you wanted to consult me archer finally asked m riviere bent his head not in my own behalf on that score ii have fully dealt with myself i should likeif i mayto speak to you about the countess olenska archer had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming but when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he had been caught by a bentback branch in a thicket and on whose behalf he said do you wish to do this m riviere met the question sturdily welli might say hers if it did not sound like a liberty shall i say instead on behalf of abstract justice archer considered him ironically in other words you are count olenskis messenger he saw his blush more darkly reflected in m rivieres sallow countenance not to you monsieur if i come to you it is on quite other grounds what right have you in the circumstances to be on any other ground archer retorted if youre an emissary youre an emissary the young man considered my mission is over as far as the countess olenska goes it has failed i cant help that archer rejoined on the same note of irony no but you can help m riviere paused turned his hat about in his still carefully gloved hands looked into its lining and then back at archers face you can help monsieur i am convinced to make it equally a failure with her family archer pushed back his chair and stood up welland by god i will he exclaimed he stood with his hands in his pockets staring down wrathfully at the little frenchman whose face though he too had risen was still an inch or two below the line of archers eyes m riviere paled to his normal hue paler than that his complexion could hardly turn why the devil archer explosively continued should you have thoughtsince i suppose youre appealing to me on the ground of my relationship to madame olenskathat i should take a view contrary to the rest of her family the change of expression in m rivieres face was for a time his only answer his look passed from timidity to absolute distress for a young man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult to appear more disarmed and defenceless oh monsieur i cant imagine archer continued why you should have come to me when there are others so much nearer to the countess still less why you thought i should be more accessible to the arguments i suppose you were sent over with m riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility the arguments i want to present to you monsieur are my own and not those i was sent over with then i see still less reason for listening to them m riviere again looked into his hat as if considering whether these last words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone then he spoke with sudden decision monsieurwill you tell me one thing is it my right to be here that you question or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed his quiet insistence made archer feel the clumsiness of his own bluster m riviere had succeeded in imposing himself archer reddening slightly dropped into his chair again and signed to the young man to be seated i beg your pardon but why isnt the matter closed m riviere gazed back at him with anguish you do then agree with the rest of the family that in face of the new proposals i have brought it is hardly possible for madame olenska not to return to her husband good god archer exclaimed and his visitor gave out a low murmur of confirmation before seeing her i sawat count olenskis requestmr lovell mingott with whom i had several talks before going to boston i understand that he represents his mothers view and that mrs manson mingotts influence is great throughout her family archer sat silent with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding precipice the discovery that he had been excluded from a share in these negotiations and even from the knowledge that they were on foot caused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was learning he saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult him it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no longer on their side and he recalled with a start of comprehension a remark of mays during their drive home from mrs manson mingotts on the day of the archery meeting perhaps after all ellen would be happier with her husband even in the tumult of new discoveries archer remembered his indignant exclamation and the fact that since then his wife had never named madame olenska to him her careless allusion had no doubt been the straw held up to see which way the wind blew the result had been reported to the family and thereafter archer had been tacitly omitted from their counsels he admired the tribal discipline which made may bow to this decision she would not have done so he knew had her conscience protested but she probably shared the family view that madame olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a separated one and that there was no use in discussing the case with newland who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the most fundamental things for granted archer looked up and met his visitors anxious gaze dont you know monsieuris it possible you dont knowthat the family begin to doubt if they have the right to advise the countess to refuse her husbands last proposals the proposals you brought the proposals i brought it was on archers lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not know was no concern of m rivieres but something in the humble and yet courageous tenacity of m rivieres gaze made him reject this conclusion and he met the young mans question with another what is your object in speaking to me of this he had not to wait a moment for the answer to beg you monsieurto beg you with all the force im capable ofnot to let her go backoh dont let her m riviere exclaimed archer looked at him with increasing astonishment there was no mistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his determination he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the board but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record archer considered may i ask he said at length if this is the line you took with the countess olenska m riviere reddened but his eyes did not falter no monsieur i accepted my mission in good faith i really believedfor reasons i need not trouble you withthat it would be better for madame olenska to recover her situation her fortune the social consideration that her husbands standing gives her so i supposed you could hardly have accepted such a mission otherwise i should not have accepted it well then archer paused again and their eyes met in another protracted scrutiny ah monsieur after i had seen her after i had listened to her i knew she was better off here you knew monsieur i discharged my mission faithfully i put the counts arguments i stated his offers without adding any comment of my own the countess was good enough to listen patiently she carried her goodness so far as to see me twice she considered impartially all i had come to say and it was in the course of these two talks that i changed my mind that i came to see things differently may i ask what led to this change simply seeing the change in her m riviere replied the change in her then you knew her before the young mans colour again rose i used to see her in her husbands house i have known count olenski for many years you can imagine that he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission archers gaze wandering away to the blank walls of the office rested on a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the president of the united states that such a conversation should be going on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his rule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent the changewhat sort of a change ah monsieur if i could tell you m riviere paused tenezthe discovery i suppose of what id never thought of before that shes an american and that if youre an american of her kindof your kindthings that are accepted in certain other societies or at least put up with as part of a general convenient giveandtakebecome unthinkable simply unthinkable if madame olenskas relations understood what these things were their opposition to her returning would no doubt be as unconditional as her own but they seem to regard her husbands wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing for domestic life m riviere paused and then added whereas its far from being as simple as that archer looked back to the president of the united states and then down at his desk and at the papers scattered on it for a second or two he could not trust himself to speak during this interval he heard m rivieres chair pushed back and was aware that the young man had risen when he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved as himself thank you archer said simply theres nothing to thank me for monsieur it is i rather m riviere broke off as if speech for him too were difficult i should like though he continued in a firmer voice to add one thing you asked me if i was in count olenskis employ i am at this moment i returned to him a few months ago for reasons of private necessity such as may happen to any one who has persons ill and older persons dependent on him but from the moment that i have taken the step of coming here to say these things to you i consider myself discharged and i shall tell him so on my return and give him the reasons thats all monsieur m riviere bowed and drew back a step thank you archer said again as their hands met every year on the fifteenth of october fifth avenue opened its shutters unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of windowcurtains by the first of november this household ritual was over and society had begun to look about and take stock of itself by the fifteenth the season was in full blast opera and theatres were putting forth their new attractions dinnerengagements were accumulating and dates for dances being fixed and punctually at about this time mrs archer always said that new york was very much changed observing it from the lofty standpoint of a nonparticipant she was able with the help of mr sillerton jackson and miss sophy to trace each new crack in its surface and all the strange weeds pushing up between the ordered rows of social vegetables it had been one of the amusements of archers youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of his mothers and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of disintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked for new york to mrs archers mind never changed without changing for the worse and in this view miss sophy jackson heartily concurred mr sillerton jackson as became a man of the world suspended his judgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations of the ladies but even he never denied that new york had changed and newland archer in the winter of the second year of his marriage was himself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was certainly changing these points had been raised as usual at mrs archers thanksgiving dinner at the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks for the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful though not embittered stock of her world and wonder what there was to be thankful for at any rate not the state of society society if it could be said to exist was rather a spectacle on which to call down biblical imprecationsand in fact every one knew what the reverend dr ashmore meant when he chose a text from jeremiah chap ii verse 25 for his thanksgiving sermon dr ashmore the new rector of st matthews had been chosen because he was very advanced his sermons were considered bold in thought and novel in language when he fulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its trend and to mrs archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel herself part of a community that was trending theres no doubt that dr ashmore is right there is a marked trend she said as if it were something visible and measurable like a crack in a house it was odd though to preach about it on thanksgiving miss jackson opined and her hostess drily rejoined oh he means us to give thanks for whats left archer had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his mothers but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge as he listened to an enumeration of the changes that the trend was visible the extravagance in dress miss jackson began sillerton took me to the first night of the opera and i can only tell you that jane merrys dress was the only one i recognised from last year and even that had had the front panel changed yet i know she got it out from worth only two years ago because my seamstress always goes in to make over her paris dresses before she wears them ah jane merry is one of us said mrs archer sighing as if it were not such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning to flaunt abroad their paris dresses as soon as they were out of the custom house instead of letting them mellow under lock and key in the manner of mrs archers contemporaries yes shes one of the few in my youth miss jackson rejoined it was considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions and amy sillerton has always told me that in boston the rule was to put away ones paris dresses for two years old mrs baxter pennilow who did everything handsomely used to import twelve a year two velvet two satin two silk and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere it was a standing order and as she was ill for two years before she died they found fortyeight worth dresses that had never been taken out of tissue paper and when the girls left off their mourning they were able to wear the first lot at the symphony concerts without looking in advance of the fashion ah well boston is more conservative than new york but i always think its a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her french dresses for one season mrs archer conceded it was beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived i must say at times it takes all reginas distinction not to look like like miss jackson glanced around the table caught janeys bulging gaze and took refuge in an unintelligible murmur like her rivals said mr sillerton jackson with the air of producing an epigram oh the ladies murmured and mrs archer added partly to distract her daughters attention from forbidden topics poor regina her thanksgiving hasnt been a very cheerful one im afraid have you heard the rumours about beauforts speculations sillerton mr jackson nodded carelessly every one had heard the rumours in question and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common property a gloomy silence fell upon the party no one really liked beaufort and it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private life but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his wifes family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies archers new york tolerated hypocrisy in private relations but in business matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty it was a long time since any wellknown banker had failed discreditably but every one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the firm when the last event of the kind had happened it would be the same with the beauforts in spite of his power and her popularity not all the leagued strength of the dallas connection would save poor regina if there were any truth in the reports of her husbands unlawful speculations the talk took refuge in less ominous topics but everything they touched on seemed to confirm mrs archers sense of an accelerated trend of course newland i know you let dear may go to mrs strutherss sunday evenings she began and may interposed gaily oh you know everybody goes to mrs strutherss now and she was invited to grannys last reception it was thus archer reflected that new york managed its transitions conspiring to ignore them till they were well over and then in all good faith imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age there was always a traitor in the citadel and after he or generally she had surrendered the keys what was the use of pretending that it was impregnable once people had tasted of mrs strutherss easy sunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that her champagne was transmuted shoepolish i know dear i know mrs archer sighed such things have to be i suppose as long as amusement is what people go out for but ive never quite forgiven your cousin madame olenska for being the first person to countenance mrs struthers a sudden blush rose to young mrs archers face it surprised her husband as much as the other guests about the table oh ellen she murmured much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which her parents might have said oh the blenkers it was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention of the countess olenskas name since she had surprised and inconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husbands advances but on mays lips it gave food for thought and archer looked at her with the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was most in the tone of her environment his mother with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere still insisted ive always thought that people like the countess olenska who have lived in aristocratic societies ought to help us to keep up our social distinctions instead of ignoring them mays blush remained permanently vivid it seemed to have a significance beyond that implied by the recognition of madame olenskas social bad faith ive no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners said miss jackson tartly i dont think ellen cares for society but nobody knows exactly what she does care for may continued as if she had been groping for something noncommittal ah well mrs archer sighed again everybody knew that the countess olenska was no longer in the good graces of her family even her devoted champion old mrs manson mingott had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her husband the mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud their sense of solidarity was too strong they had simply as mrs welland said let poor ellen find her own leveland that mortifyingly and incomprehensibly was in the dim depths where the blenkers prevailed and people who wrote celebrated their untidy rites it was incredible but it was a fact that ellen in spite of all her opportunities and her privileges had become simply bohemian the fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in not returning to count olenski after all a young womans place was under her husbands roof especially when she had left it in circumstances that well if one had cared to look into them madame olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen said miss sophy with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when she knew that she was planting a dart ah thats the danger that a young woman like madame olenska is always exposed to mrs archer mournfully agreed and the ladies on this conclusion gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the drawingroom while archer and mr sillerton jackson withdrew to the gothic library once established before the grate and consoling himself for the inadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar mr jackson became portentous and communicable if the beaufort smash comes he announced there are going to be disclosures archer raised his head quickly he could never hear the name without the sharp vision of beauforts heavy figure opulently furred and shod advancing through the snow at skuytercliff theres bound to be mr jackson continued the nastiest kind of a cleaning up he hasnt spent all his money on regina oh wellthats discounted isnt it my belief is hell pull out yet said the young man wanting to change the subject perhapsperhaps i know he was to see some of the influential people today of course mr jackson reluctantly conceded its to be hoped they can tide him overthis time anyhow i shouldnt like to think of poor reginas spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign wateringplace for bankrupts archer said nothing it seemed to him so naturalhowever tragicthat money illgotten should be cruelly expiated that his mind hardly lingering over mrs beauforts doom wandered back to closer questions what was the meaning of mays blush when the countess olenska had been mentioned four months had passed since the midsummer day that he and madame olenska had spent together and since then he had not seen her he knew that she had returned to washington to the little house which she and medora manson had taken there he had written to her oncea few words asking when they were to meet againand she had even more briefly replied not yet since then there had been no farther communication between them and he had built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned among his secret thoughts and longings little by little it became the scene of his real life of his only rational activities thither he brought the books he read the ideas and feelings which nourished him his judgments and his visions outside it in the scene of his actual life he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency blundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absentminded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room absentthat was what he was so absent from everything most densely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him to find they still imagined he was there he became aware that mr jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to farther revelations i dont know of course how far your wifes family are aware of what people say aboutwell about madame olenskas refusal to accept her husbands latest offer archer was silent and mr jackson obliquely continued its a pityits certainly a pitythat she refused it a pity in gods name why mr jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it to a glossy pump wellto put it on the lowest groundwhats she going to live on now now if beaufort archer sprang up his fist banging down on the black walnutedge of the writingtable the wells of the brass doubleinkstand danced in their sockets what the devil do you mean sir mr jackson shifting himself slightly in his chair turned a tranquil gaze on the young mans burning face welli have it on pretty good authorityin fact on old catherines herselfthat the family reduced countess olenskas allowance considerably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband and as by this refusal she also forfeits the money settled on her when she marriedwhich olenski was ready to make over to her if she returnedwhy what the devil do you mean my dear boy by asking me what i mean mr jackson goodhumouredly retorted archer moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes into the grate i dont know anything of madame olenskas private affairs but i dont need to to be certain that what you insinuate oh i dont its lefferts for one mr jackson interposed leffertswho made love to her and got snubbed for it archer broke out contemptuously ahdid he snapped the other as if this were exactly the fact he had been laying a trap for he still sat sideways from the fire so that his hard old gaze held archers face as if in a spring of steel well well its a pity she didnt go back before beauforts cropper he repeated if she goes now and if he fails it will only confirm the general impression which isnt by any means peculiar to lefferts by the way oh she wont go back now less than ever archer had no sooner said it than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what mr jackson had been waiting for the old gentleman considered him attentively thats your opinion eh well no doubt you know but everybody will tell you that the few pennies medora manson has left are all in beauforts hands and how the two women are to keep their heads above water unless he does i cant imagine of course madame olenska may still soften old catherine whos been the most inexorably opposed to her staying and old catherine could make her any allowance she chooses but we all know that she hates parting with good money and the rest of the family have no particular interest in keeping madame olenska here archer was burning with unavailing wrath he was exactly in the state when a man is sure to do something stupid knowing all the while that he is doing it he saw that mr jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that madame olenskas differences with her grandmother and her other relations were not known to him and that the old gentleman had drawn his own conclusions as to the reasons for archers exclusion from the family councils this fact warned archer to go warily but the insinuations about beaufort made him reckless he was mindful however if not of his own danger at least of the fact that mr jackson was under his mothers roof and consequently his guest old new york scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality and no discussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a disagreement shall we go up and join my mother he suggested curtly as mr jacksons last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his elbow on the drive homeward may remained oddly silent through the darkness he still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush what its menace meant he could not guess but he was sufficiently warned by the fact that madame olenskas name had evoked it they went upstairs and he turned into the library she usually followed him but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom may he called out impatiently and she came back with a slight glance of surprise at his tone this lamp is smoking again i should think the servants might see that its kept properly trimmed he grumbled nervously im so sorry it shant happen again she answered in the firm bright tone she had learned from her mother and it exasperated archer to feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger mr welland she bent over to lower the wick and as the light struck up on her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought how young she is for what endless years this life will have to go on he felt with a kind of horror his own strong youth and the bounding blood in his veins look here he said suddenly i may have to go to washington for a few dayssoon next week perhaps her hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly the heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face but it paled as she looked up on business she asked in a tone which implied that there could be no other conceivable reason and that she had put the question automatically as if merely to finish his own sentence on business naturally theres a patent case coming up before the supreme court he gave the name of the inventor and went on furnishing details with all lawrence leffertss practised glibness while she listened attentively saying at intervals yes i see the change will do you good she said simply when he had finished and you must be sure to go and see ellen she added looking him straight in the eyes with her cloudless smile and speaking in the tone she might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome family duty it was the only word that passed between them on the subject but in the code in which they had both been trained it meant of course you understand that i know all that people have been saying about ellen and heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to return to her husband i also know that for some reason you have not chosen to tell me you have advised her against this course which all the older men of the family as well as our grandmother agree in approving and that it is owing to your encouragement that ellen defies us all and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which mr sillerton jackson probably gave you this evening the hint that has made you so irritable hints have indeed not been wanting but since you appear unwilling to take them from others i offer you this one myself in the only form in which wellbred people of our kind can communicate unpleasant things to each other by letting you understand that i know you mean to see ellen when you are in washington and are perhaps going there expressly for that purpose and that since you are sure to see her i wish you to do so with my full and explicit approvaland to take the opportunity of letting her know what the course of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to her hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this mute message reached him she turned the wick down lifted off the globe and breathed on the sulky flame they smell less if one blows them out she explained with her bright housekeeping air on the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss wall street the next day had more reassuring reports of beauforts situation they were not definite but they were hopeful it was generally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case of emergency and that he had done so with success and that evening when mrs beaufort appeared at the opera wearing her old smile and a new emerald necklace society drew a breath of relief new york was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities so far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who broke the law of probity must pay and every one was aware that even beaufort and beauforts wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this principle but to be obliged to offer them up would be not only painful but inconvenient the disappearance of the beauforts would leave a considerable void in their compact little circle and those who were too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe bewailed in advance the loss of the best ballroom in new york archer had definitely made up his mind to go to washington he was waiting only for the opening of the lawsuit of which he had spoken to may so that its date might coincide with that of his visit but on the following tuesday he learned from mr letterblair that the case might be postponed for several weeks nevertheless he went home that afternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening the chances were that may who knew nothing of his professional life and had never shown any interest in it would not learn of the postponement should it take place nor remember the names of the litigants if they were mentioned before her and at any rate he could no longer put off seeing madame olenska there were too many things that he must say to her on the wednesday morning when he reached his office mr letterblair met him with a troubled face beaufort after all had not managed to tide over but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he had reassured his depositors and heavy payments had poured into the bank till the previous evening when disturbing reports again began to predominate in consequence a run on the bank had begun and its doors were likely to close before the day was over the ugliest things were being said of beauforts dastardly manoeuvre and his failure promised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of wall street the extent of the calamity left mr letterblair white and incapacitated ive seen bad things in my time but nothing as bad as this everybody we know will be hit one way or another and what will be done about mrs beaufort what can be done about her i pity mrs manson mingott as much as anybody coming at her age theres no knowing what effect this affair may have on her she always believed in beaufortshe made a friend of him and theres the whole dallas connection poor mrs beaufort is related to every one of you her only chance would be to leave her husbandyet how can any one tell her so her duty is at his side and luckily she seems always to have been blind to his private weaknesses there was a knock and mr letterblair turned his head sharply what is it i cant be disturbed a clerk brought in a letter for archer and withdrew recognising his wifes hand the young man opened the envelope and read wont you please come up town as early as you can granny had a slight stroke last night in some mysterious way she found out before any one else this awful news about the bank uncle lovell is away shooting and the idea of the disgrace has made poor papa so nervous that he has a temperature and cant leave his room mamma needs you dreadfully and i do hope you can get away at once and go straight to grannys archer handed the note to his senior partner and a few minutes later was crawling northward in a crowded horsecar which he exchanged at fourteenth street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the fifth avenue line it was after twelve oclock when this laborious vehicle dropped him at old catherines the sittingroom window on the ground floor where she usually throned was tenanted by the inadequate figure of her daughter mrs welland who signed a haggard welcome as she caught sight of archer and at the door he was met by may the hall wore the unnatural appearance peculiar to wellkept houses suddenly invaded by illness wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs a doctors bag and overcoat were on the table and beside them letters and cards had already piled up unheeded may looked pale but smiling dr bencomb who had just come for the second time took a more hopeful view and mrs mingotts dauntless determination to live and get well was already having an effect on her family may led archer into the old ladys sittingroom where the sliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut and the heavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them and here mrs welland communicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the catastrophe it appeared that the evening before something dreadful and mysterious had happened at about eight oclock just after mrs mingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after dinner the doorbell had rung and a lady so thickly veiled that the servants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received the butler hearing a familiar voice had thrown open the sittingroom door announcing mrs julius beaufortand had then closed it again on the two ladies they must have been together he thought about an hour when mrs mingotts bell rang mrs beaufort had already slipped away unseen and the old lady white and vast and terrible sat alone in her great chair and signed to the butler to help her into her room she seemed at that time though obviously distressed in complete control of her body and brain the mulatto maid put her to bed brought her a cup of tea as usual laid everything straight in the room and went away but at three in the morning the bell rang again and the two servants hastening in at this unwonted summons for old catherine usually slept like a baby had found their mistress sitting up against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little hand hanging limp from its huge arm the stroke had clearly been a slight one for she was able to articulate and to make her wishes known and soon after the doctors first visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles but the alarm had been great and proportionately great was the indignation when it was gathered from mrs mingotts fragmentary phrases that regina beaufort had come to ask herincredible effronteryto back up her husband see them throughnot to desert them as she called itin fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their monstrous dishonour i said to her honours always been honour and honesty honesty in manson mingotts house and will be till im carried out of it feet first the old woman had stammered into her daughters ear in the thick voice of the partly paralysed and when she said but my name auntiemy names regina dallas i said it was beaufort when he covered you with jewels and its got to stay beaufort now that hes covered you with shame so much with tears and gasps of horror mrs welland imparted blanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to fix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable if only i could keep it from your fatherinlaw he always says augusta for pitys sake dont destroy my last illusionsand how am i to prevent his knowing these horrors the poor lady wailed after all mamma he wont have seen them her daughter suggested and mrs welland sighed ah no thank heaven hes safe in bed and dr bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor mamma is better and regina has been got away somewhere archer had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at the deserted thoroughfare it was evident that he had been summoned rather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any specific aid that he could render mr lovell mingott had been telegraphed for and messages were being despatched by hand to the members of the family living in new york and meanwhile there was nothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of beauforts dishonour and of his wifes unjustifiable action mrs lovell mingott who had been in another room writing notes presently reappeared and added her voice to the discussion in their day the elder ladies agreed the wife of a man who had done anything disgraceful in business had only one idea to efface herself to disappear with him there was the case of poor grandmamma spicer your greatgrandmother may of course mrs welland hastened to add your greatgrandfathers money difficulties were privatelosses at cards or signing a note for somebodyi never quite knew because mamma would never speak of it but she was brought up in the country because her mother had to leave new york after the disgrace whatever it was they lived up the hudson alone winter and summer till mamma was sixteen it would never have occurred to grandmamma spicer to ask the family to countenance her as i understand regina calls it though a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining hundreds of innocent people yes it would be more becoming in regina to hide her own countenance than to talk about other peoples mrs lovell mingott agreed i understand that the emerald necklace she wore at the opera last friday had been sent on approval from ball and blacks in the afternoon i wonder if theyll ever get it back archer listened unmoved to the relentless chorus the idea of absolute financial probity as the first law of a gentlemans code was too deeply ingrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it an adventurer like lemuel struthers might build up the millions of his shoe polish on any number of shady dealings but unblemished honesty was the noblesse oblige of old financial new york nor did mrs beauforts fate greatly move archer he felt no doubt more sorry for her than her indignant relatives but it seemed to him that the tie between husband and wife even if breakable in prosperity should be indissoluble in misfortune as mr letterblair had said a wifes place was at her husbands side when he was in trouble but societys place was not at his side and mrs beauforts cool assumption that it was seemed almost to make her his accomplice the mere idea of a womans appealing to her family to screen her husbands business dishonour was inadmissible since it was the one thing that the family as an institution could not do the mulatto maid called mrs lovell mingott into the hall and the latter came back in a moment with a frowning brow she wants me to telegraph for ellen olenska i had written to ellen of course and to medora but now it seems thats not enough im to telegraph to her immediately and to tell her that shes to come alone the announcement was received in silence mrs welland sighed resignedly and may rose from her seat and went to gather up some newspapers that had been scattered on the floor i suppose it must be done mrs lovell mingott continued as if hoping to be contradicted and may turned back toward the middle of the room of course it must be done she said granny knows what she wants and we must carry out all her wishes shall i write the telegram for you auntie if it goes at once ellen can probably catch tomorrow mornings train she pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness as if she had tapped on two silver bells well it cant go at once jasper and the pantryboy are both out with notes and telegrams may turned to her husband with a smile but heres newland ready to do anything will you take the telegram newland therell be just time before luncheon archer rose with a murmur of readiness and she seated herself at old catherines rosewood bonheur du jour and wrote out the message in her large immature hand when it was written she blotted it neatly and handed it to archer what a pity she said that you and ellen will cross each other on the waynewland she added turning to her mother and aunt is obliged to go to washington about a patent lawsuit that is coming up before the supreme court i suppose uncle lovell will be back by tomorrow night and with granny improving so much it doesnt seem right to ask newland to give up an important engagement for the firmdoes it she paused as if for an answer and mrs welland hastily declared oh of course not darling your granny would be the last person to wish it as archer left the room with the telegram he heard his motherinlaw add presumably to mrs lovell mingott but why on earth she should make you telegraph for ellen olenska and mays clear voice rejoin perhaps its to urge on her again that after all her duty is with her husband the outer door closed on archer and he walked hastily away toward the telegraph office ololhowjer spell it anyhow asked the tart young lady to whom archer had pushed his wifes telegram across the brass ledge of the western union office olenskaolenska he repeated drawing back the message in order to print out the foreign syllables above mays rambling script its an unlikely name for a new york telegraph office at least in this quarter an unexpected voice observed and turning around archer saw lawrence lefferts at his elbow pulling an imperturbable moustache and affecting not to glance at the message hallo newland thought id catch you here ive just heard of old mrs mingotts stroke and as i was on my way to the house i saw you turning down this street and nipped after you i suppose youve come from there archer nodded and pushed his telegram under the lattice very bad eh lefferts continued wiring to the family i suppose i gather it is bad if youre including countess olenska archers lips stiffened he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into the long vain handsome face at his side why he questioned lefferts who was known to shrink from discussion raised his eyebrows with an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel behind the lattice nothing could be worse form the look reminded archer than any display of temper in a public place archer had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form but his impulse to do lawrence lefferts a physical injury was only momentary the idea of bandying ellen olenskas name with him at such a time and on whatsoever provocation was unthinkable he paid for his telegram and the two young men went out together into the street there archer having regained his selfcontrol went on mrs mingott is much better the doctor feels no anxiety whatever and lefferts with profuse expressions of relief asked him if he had heard that there were beastly bad rumours again about beaufort that afternoon the announcement of the beaufort failure was in all the papers it overshadowed the report of mrs manson mingotts stroke and only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the two events thought of ascribing old catherines illness to anything but the accumulation of flesh and years the whole of new york was darkened by the tale of beauforts dishonour there had never as mr letterblair said been a worse case in his memory nor for that matter in the memory of the faroff letterblair who had given his name to the firm the bank had continued to take in money for a whole day after its failure was inevitable and as many of its clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans beauforts duplicity seemed doubly cynical if mrs beaufort had not taken the tone that such misfortunes the word was her own were the test of friendship compassion for her might have tempered the general indignation against her husband as it wasand especially after the object of her nocturnal visit to mrs manson mingott had become knownher cynicism was held to exceed his and she had not the excusenor her detractors the satisfactionof pleading that she was a foreigner it was some comfort to those whose securities were not in jeopardy to be able to remind themselves that beaufort was but after all if a dallas of south carolina took his view of the case and glibly talked of his soon being on his feet again the argument lost its edge and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence of the indissolubility of marriage society must manage to get on without the beauforts and there was an end of itexcept indeed for such hapless victims of the disaster as medora manson the poor old miss lannings and certain other misguided ladies of good family who if only they had listened to mr henry van der luyden the best thing the beauforts can do said mrs archer summing it up as if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of treatment is to go and live at reginas little place in north carolina beaufort has always kept a racing stable and he had better breed trotting horses i should say he had all the qualities of a successful horsedealer every one agreed with her but no one condescended to enquire what the beauforts really meant to do the next day mrs manson mingott was much better she recovered her voice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the beauforts to her again and askedwhen dr bencomb appearedwhat in the world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health if people of my age will eat chickensalad in the evening what are they to expect she enquired and the doctor having opportunely modified her dietary the stroke was transformed into an attack of indigestion but in spite of her firm tone old catherine did not wholly recover her former attitude toward life the growing remoteness of old age though it had not diminished her curiosity about her neighbours had blunted her never very lively compassion for their troubles and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the beaufort disaster out of her mind but for the first time she became absorbed in her own symptoms and began to take a sentimental interest in certain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been contemptuously indifferent mr welland in particular had the privilege of attracting her notice of her sonsinlaw he was the one she had most consistently ignored and all his wifes efforts to represent him as a man of forceful character and marked intellectual ability if he had only chosen had been met with a derisive chuckle but his eminence as a valetudinarian now made him an object of engrossing interest and mrs mingott issued an imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his temperature permitted for old catherine was now the first to recognise that one could not be too careful about temperatures twentyfour hours after madame olenskas summons a telegram announced that she would arrive from washington on the evening of the following day at the wellands where the newland archers chanced to be lunching the question as to who should meet her at jersey city was immediately raised and the material difficulties amid which the welland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost lent animation to the debate it was agreed that mrs welland could not possibly go to jersey city because she was to accompany her husband to old catherines that afternoon and the brougham could not be spared since if mr welland were upset by seeing his motherinlaw for the first time after her attack he might have to be taken home at a moments notice the welland sons would of course be down town mr lovell mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting and the mingott carriage engaged in meeting him and one could not ask may at the close of a winter afternoon to go alone across the ferry to jersey city even in her own carriage nevertheless it might appear inhospitableand contrary to old catherines express wishesif madame olenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the station to receive her it was just like ellen mrs wellands tired voice implied to place the family in such a dilemma its always one thing after another the poor lady grieved in one of her rare revolts against fate the only thing that makes me think mamma must be less well than dr bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have ellen come at once however inconvenient it is to meet her the words had been thoughtless as the utterances of impatience often are and mr welland was upon them with a pounce augusta he said turning pale and laying down his fork have you any other reason for thinking that bencomb is less to be relied on than he was have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than usual in following up my case or your mothers it was mrs wellands turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of her blunder unrolled themselves before her but she managed to laugh and take a second helping of scalloped oysters before she said struggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness my dear how could you imagine such a thing i only meant that after the decided stand mamma took about its being ellens duty to go back to her husband it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden whim to see her when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that she might have asked for but we must never forget that mamma in spite of her wonderful vitality is a very old woman mr wellands brow remained clouded and it was evident that his perturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark yes your mothers a very old woman and for all we know bencomb may not be as successful with very old people as you say my dear its always one thing after another and in another ten or fifteen years i suppose i shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor its always better to make such a change before its absolutely necessary and having arrived at this spartan decision mr welland firmly took up his fork but all the while mrs welland began again as she rose from the luncheontable and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and malachite known as the back drawingroom i dont see how ellens to be got here tomorrow evening and i do like to have things settled for at least twentyfour hours ahead archer turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting representing two cardinals carousing in an octagonal ebony frame set with medallions of onyx shall i fetch her he proposed i can easily get away from the office in time to meet the brougham at the ferry if may will send it there his heart was beating excitedly as he spoke mrs welland heaved a sigh of gratitude and may who had moved away to the window turned to shed on him a beam of approval so you see mamma everything will be settled twentyfour hours in advance she said stooping over to kiss her mothers troubled forehead mays brougham awaited her at the door and she was to drive archer to union square where he could pick up a broadway car to carry him to the office as she settled herself in her corner she said i didnt want to worry mamma by raising fresh obstacles but how can you meet ellen tomorrow and bring her back to new york when youre going to washington oh im not going archer answered not going why whats happened her voice was as clear as a bell and full of wifely solicitude the case is offpostponed postponed how odd i saw a note this morning from mr letterblair to mamma saying that he was going to washington tomorrow for the big patent case that he was to argue before the supreme court you said it was a patent case didnt you wellthats it the whole office cant go letterblair decided to go this morning then its not postponed she continued with an insistence so unlike her that he felt the blood rising to his face as if he were blushing for her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies no but my going is he answered cursing the unnecessary explanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of going to washington and wondering where he had read that clever liars give details but that the cleverest do not it did not hurt him half as much to tell may an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she had not detected him im not going till later on luckily for the convenience of your family he continued taking base refuge in sarcasm as he spoke he felt that she was looking at him and he turned his eyes to hers in order not to appear to be avoiding them their glances met for a second and perhaps let them into each others meanings more deeply than either cared to go yes it is awfully convenient may brightly agreed that you should be able to meet ellen after all you saw how much mamma appreciated your offering to do it oh im delighted to do it the carriage stopped and as he jumped out she leaned to him and laid her hand on his goodbye dearest she said her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone on him through tears he turned away and hurried across union square repeating to himself in a sort of inward chant its all of two hours from jersey city to old catherines its all of two hoursand it may be more his wifes dark blue brougham with the wedding varnish still on it met archer at the ferry and conveyed him luxuriously to the pennsylvania terminus in jersey city it was a sombre snowy afternoon and the gaslamps were lit in the big reverberating station as he paced the platform waiting for the washington express he remembered that there were people who thought there would one day be a tunnel under the hudson through which the trains of the pennsylvania railway would run straight into new york they were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the building of ships that would cross the atlantic in five days the invention of a flying machine lighting by electricity telephonic communication without wires and other arabian night marvels i dont care which of their visions comes true archer mused as long as the tunnel isnt built yet in his senseless schoolboy happiness he pictured madame olenskas descent from the train his discovery of her a long way off among the throngs of meaningless faces her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage their slow approach to the wharf among slipping horses laden carts vociferating teamsters and then the startling quiet of the ferryboat where they would sit side by side under the snow in the motionless carriage while the earth seemed to glide away under them rolling to the other side of the sun it was incredible the number of things he had to say to her and in what eloquent order they were forming themselves on his lips the clanging and groaning of the train came nearer and it staggered slowly into the station like a preyladen monster into its lair archer pushed forward elbowing through the crowd and staring blindly into window after window of the highhung carriages and then suddenly he saw madame olenskas pale and surprised face close at hand and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what she looked like they reached each other their hands met and he drew her arm through his this wayi have the carriage he said after that it all happened as he had dreamed he helped her into the brougham with her bags and had afterward the vague recollection of having properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a summary of the beaufort situation he was struck by the softness of her poor regina meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out of the coil about the station and they were crawling down the slippery incline to the wharf menaced by swaying coalcarts bewildered horses dishevelled expresswagons and an empty hearseah that hearse she shut her eyes as it passed and clutched at archers hand if only it doesnt meanpoor granny oh no noshes much bettershes all right really thereweve passed it he exclaimed as if that made all the difference her hand remained in his and as the carriage lurched across the gangplank onto the ferry he bent over unbuttoned her tight brown glove and kissed her palm as if he had kissed a relic she disengaged herself with a faint smile and he said you didnt expect me today oh no i meant to go to washington to see you id made all my arrangementsi very nearly crossed you in the train oh she exclaimed as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape do you knowi hardly remembered you hardly remembered me i mean how shall i explain iits always so each time you happen to me all over again oh yes i know i know does itdo i too to you he insisted she nodded looking out of the window ellenellenellen she made no answer and he sat in silence watching her profile grow indistinct against the snowstreaked dusk beyond the window what had she been doing in all those four long months he wondered how little they knew of each other after all the precious moments were slipping away but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her and could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and their proximity which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their sitting so close to each other and yet being unable to see each others faces what a pretty carriage is it mays she asked suddenly turning her face from the window yes it was may who sent you to fetch me then how kind of her he made no answer for a moment then he said explosively your husbands secretary came to see me the day after we met in boston in his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to m rivieres visit and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom but her reminder that they were in his wifes carriage provoked him to an impulse of retaliation he would see if she liked his reference to riviere any better than he liked hers to may as on certain other occasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure she betrayed no sign of surprise and at once he concluded he writes to her then m riviere went to see you yes didnt you know no she answered simply and youre not surprised she hesitated why should i be he told me in boston that he knew you that hed met you in england i think elleni must ask you one thing yes i wanted to ask it after i saw him but i couldnt put it in a letter it was riviere who helped you to get awaywhen you left your husband his heart was beating suffocatingly would she meet this question with the same composure yes i owe him a great debt she answered without the least tremor in her quiet voice her tone was so natural so almost indifferent that archers turmoil subsided once more she had managed by her sheer simplicity to make him feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging convention to the winds i think youre the most honest woman i ever met he exclaimed oh nobut probably one of the least fussy she answered a smile in her voice call it what you like you look at things as they are ahive had to ive had to look at the gorgon wellit hasnt blinded you youve seen that shes just an old bogey like all the others she doesnt blind one but she dries up ones tears the answer checked the pleading on archers lips it seemed to come from depths of experience beyond his reach the slow advance of the ferryboat had ceased and her bows bumped against the piles of the slip with a violence that made the brougham stagger and flung archer and madame olenska against each other the young man trembling felt the pressure of her shoulder and passed his arm about her if youre not blind then you must see that this cant last what cant our being togetherand not together no you ought not to have come today she said in an altered voice and suddenly she turned flung her arms about him and pressed her lips to his at the same moment the carriage began to move and a gaslamp at the head of the slip flashed its light into the window she drew away and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled through the congestion of carriages about the ferrylanding as they gained the street archer began to speak hurriedly dont be afraid of me you neednt squeeze yourself back into your corner like that a stolen kiss isnt what i want look im not even trying to touch the sleeve of your jacket dont suppose that i dont understand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us dwindle into an ordinary holeandcorner loveaffair i couldnt have spoken like this yesterday because when weve been apart and im looking forward to seeing you every thought is burnt up in a great flame but then you come and youre so much more than i remembered and what i want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then with wastes of thirsty waiting between that i can sit perfectly still beside you like this with that other vision in my mind just quietly trusting to it to come true for a moment she made no reply then she asked hardly above a whisper what do you mean by trusting to it to come true whyyou know it will dont you your vision of you and me together she burst into a sudden hard laugh you choose your place well to put it to me do you mean because were in my wifes brougham shall we get out and walk then i dont suppose you mind a little snow she laughed again more gently no i shant get out and walk because my business is to get to grannys as quickly as i can and youll sit beside me and well look not at visions but at realities i dont know what you mean by realities the only reality to me is this she met the words with a long silence during which the carriage rolled down an obscure sidestreet and then turned into the searching illumination of fifth avenue is it your idea then that i should live with you as your mistresssince i cant be your wife she asked the crudeness of the question startled him the word was one that women of his class fought shy of even when their talk flitted closest about the topic he noticed that madame olenska pronounced it as if it had a recognised place in her vocabulary and he wondered if it had been used familiarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from her question pulled him up with a jerk and he floundered i wanti want somehow to get away with you into a world where words like thatcategories like thatwont exist where we shall be simply two human beings who love each other who are the whole of life to each other and nothing else on earth will matter she drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh oh my dearwhere is that country have you ever been there she asked and as he remained sullenly dumb she went on i know so many whove tried to find it and believe me they all got out by mistake at wayside stations at places like boulogne or pisa or monte carloand it wasnt at all different from the old world theyd left but only rather smaller and dingier and more promiscuous he had never heard her speak in such a tone and he remembered the phrase she had used a little while before yes the gorgon has dried your tears he said well she opened my eyes too its a delusion to say that she blinds people what she does is just the contraryshe fastens their eyelids open so that theyre never again in the blessed darkness isnt there a chinese torture like that there ought to be ah believe me its a miserable little country the carriage had crossed fortysecond street mays sturdy broughamhorse was carrying them northward as if he had been a kentucky trotter archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words then what exactly is your plan for us he asked for us but theres no us in that sense were near each other only if we stay far from each other then we can be ourselves otherwise were only newland archer the husband of ellen olenskas cousin and ellen olenska the cousin of newland archers wife trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them ah im beyond that he groaned no youre not youve never been beyond and i have she said in a strange voice and i know what it looks like there he sat silent dazed with inarticulate pain then he groped in the darkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to the coachman he remembered that may rang twice when she wished to stop he pressed the bell and the carriage drew up beside the curbstone why are we stopping this is not grannys madame olenska exclaimed no i shall get out here he stammered opening the door and jumping to the pavement by the light of a streetlamp he saw her startled face and the instinctive motion she made to detain him he closed the door and leaned for a moment in the window youre right i ought not to have come today he said lowering his voice so that the coachman should not hear she bent forward and seemed about to speak but he had already called out the order to drive on and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner the snow was over and a tingling wind had sprung up that lashed his face as he stood gazing suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his lashes and perceived that he had been crying and that the wind had frozen his tears he thrust his hands in his pockets and walked at a sharp pace down fifth avenue to his own house that evening when archer came down before dinner he found the drawingroom empty he and may were dining alone all the family engagements having been postponed since mrs manson mingotts illness and as may was the more punctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him he knew that she was at home for while he dressed he had heard her moving about in her room and he wondered what had delayed her he had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means of tying his thoughts fast to reality sometimes he felt as if he had found the clue to his fatherinlaws absorption in trifles perhaps even mr welland long ago had had escapes and visions and had conjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them when may appeared he thought she looked tired she had put on the lownecked and tightlylaced dinnerdress which the mingott ceremonial exacted on the most informal occasions and had built her fair hair into its usual accumulated coils and her face in contrast was wan and almost faded but she shone on him with her usual tenderness and her eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before what became of you dear she asked i was waiting at grannys and ellen came alone and said she had dropped you on the way because you had to rush off on business theres nothing wrong only some letters id forgotten and wanted to get off before dinner ah she said and a moment afterward im sorry you didnt come to grannysunless the letters were urgent they were he rejoined surprised at her insistence besides i dont see why i should have gone to your grandmothers i didnt know you were there she turned and moved to the lookingglass above the mantelpiece as she stood there lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped from its place in her intricate hair archer was struck by something languid and inelastic in her attitude and wondered if the deadly monotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also then he remembered that as he had left the house that morning she had called over the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmothers so that they might drive home together he had called back a cheery yes and then absorbed in other visions had forgotten his promise now he was smitten with compunction yet irritated that so trifling an omission should be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage he was weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon without the temperature of passion yet with all its exactions if may had spoken out her grievances he suspected her of many he might have laughed them away but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a spartan smile to disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was and she answered that mrs mingott was still improving but had been rather disturbed by the last news about the beauforts what news it seems theyre going to stay in new york i believe hes going into an insurance business or something theyre looking about for a small house the preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion and they went in to dinner during dinner their talk moved in its usual limited circle but archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to madame olenska nor to old catherines reception of her he was thankful for the fact yet felt it to be vaguely ominous they went up to the library for coffee and archer lit a cigar and took down a volume of michelet he had taken to history in the evenings since may had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she saw him with a volume of poetry not that he disliked the sound of his own voice but because he could always foresee her comments on what he read in the days of their engagement she had simply as he now perceived echoed what he told her but since he had ceased to provide her with opinions she had begun to hazard her own with results destructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on seeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket drew up an armchair to the greenshaded student lamp and uncovered a cushion she was embroidering for his sofa she was not a clever needlewoman her large capable hands were made for riding rowing and openair activities but since other wives embroidered cushions for their husbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion she was so placed that archer by merely raising his eyes could see her bent above her workframe her ruffled elbowsleeves slipping back from her firm round arms the betrothal sapphire shining on her left hand above her broad gold weddingring and the right hand slowly and laboriously stabbing the canvas as she sat thus the lamplight full on her clear brow he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it that never in all the years to come would she surprise him by an unexpected mood by a new idea a weakness a cruelty or an emotion she had spent her poetry and romance on their short courting the function was exhausted because the need was past now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother and mysteriously by the very process trying to turn him into a mr welland he laid down his book and stood up impatiently and at once she raised her head whats the matter the room is stifling i want a little air he had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and forward on a rod so that they might be closed in the evening instead of remaining nailed to a gilt cornice and immovably looped up over layers of lace as in the drawingroom and he pulled them back and pushed up the sash leaning out into the icy night the mere fact of not looking at may seated beside his table under his lamp the fact of seeing other houses roofs chimneys of getting the sense of other lives outside his own other cities beyond new york and a whole world beyond his world cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe after he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard her say newland do shut the window youll catch your death he pulled the sash down and turned back catch my death he echoed and he felt like adding but ive caught it already i am deadive been dead for months and months and suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion what if it were she who was dead if she were going to dieto die soonand leave him free the sensation of standing there in that warm familiar room and looking at her and wishing her dead was so strange so fascinating and overmastering that its enormity did not immediately strike him he simply felt that chance had given him a new possibility to which his sick soul might cling yes may might diepeople did young people healthy people like herself she might die and set him suddenly free she glanced up and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be something strange in his own newland are you ill he shook his head and turned toward his armchair she bent over her workframe and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair poor may he said poor why poor she echoed with a strained laugh because i shall never be able to open a window without worrying you he rejoined laughing also for a moment she was silent then she said very low her head bowed over her work i shall never worry if youre happy ah my dear and i shall never be happy unless i can open the windows in this weather she remonstrated and with a sigh he buried his head in his book six or seven days passed archer heard nothing from madame olenska and became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence by any member of the family he did not try to see her to do so while she was at old catherines guarded bedside would have been almost impossible in the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift conscious somewhere below the surface of his thoughts of a resolve which had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window into the icy night the strength of that resolve made it easy to wait and make no sign then one day may told him that mrs manson mingott had asked to see him there was nothing surprising in the request for the old lady was steadily recovering and she had always openly declared that she preferred archer to any of her other grandsonsinlaw may gave the message with evident pleasure she was proud of old catherines appreciation of her husband there was a moments pause and then archer felt it incumbent on him to say all right shall we go together this afternoon his wifes face brightened but she instantly answered oh youd much better go alone it bores granny to see the same people too often archers heart was beating violently when he rang old mrs mingotts bell he had wanted above all things to go alone for he felt sure the visit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the countess olenska he had determined to wait till the chance presented itself naturally and here it was and here he was on the doorstep behind the door behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to the hall she was surely awaiting him in another moment he should see her and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sickroom he wanted only to put one question after that his course would be clear what he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to washington and that question she could hardly refuse to answer but in the yellow sittingroom it was the mulatto maid who waited her white teeth shining like a keyboard she pushed back the sliding doors and ushered him into old catherines presence the old woman sat in a vast thronelike armchair near her bed beside her was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved globe over which a green paper shade had been balanced there was not a book or a newspaper in reach nor any evidence of feminine employment conversation had always been mrs mingotts sole pursuit and she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork archer saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke she merely looked paler with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of her obesity and in the fluted mobcap tied by a starched bow between her first two chins and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing purple dressinggown she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress of her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the table she held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her huge lap like pet animals and called to the maid dont let in any one else if my daughters call say im asleep the maid disappeared and the old lady turned to her grandson my dear am i perfectly hideous she asked gaily launching out one hand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom my daughters tell me it doesnt matter at my ageas if hideousness didnt matter all the more the harder it gets to conceal my dear youre handsomer than ever archer rejoined in the same tone and she threw back her head and laughed ah but not as handsome as ellen she jerked out twinkling at him maliciously and before he could answer she added was she so awfully handsome the day you drove her up from the ferry he laughed and she continued was it because you told her so that she had to put you out on the way in my youth young men didnt desert pretty women unless they were made to she gave another chuckle and interrupted it to say almost querulously its a pity she didnt marry you i always told her so it would have spared me all this worry but who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry archer wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties but suddenly she broke out well its settled anyhow shes going to stay with me whatever the rest of the family say she hadnt been here five minutes before id have gone down on my knees to keep herif only for the last twenty years id been able to see where the floor was archer listened in silence and she went on theyd talked me over as no doubt you know persuaded me lovell and letterblair and augusta welland and all the rest of them that i must hold out and cut off her allowance till she was made to see that it was her duty to go back to olenski they thought theyd convinced me when the secretary or whatever he was came out with the last proposals handsome proposals i confess they were after all marriage is marriage and moneys moneyboth useful things in their way and i didnt know what to answer she broke off and drew a long breath as if speaking had become an effort but the minute i laid eyes on her i said you sweet bird you shut you up in that cage again never and now its settled that shes to stay here and nurse her granny as long as theres a granny to nurse its not a gay prospect but she doesnt mind and of course ive told letterblair that shes to be given her proper allowance the young man heard her with veins aglow but in his confusion of mind he hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain he had so definitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment he could not readjust his thoughts but gradually there stole over him the delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities miraculously provided if ellen had consented to come and live with her grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the impossibility of giving him up this was her answer to his final appeal of the other day if she would not take the extreme step he had urged she had at last yielded to halfmeasures he sank back into the thought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk everything and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security she couldnt have gone backit was impossible he exclaimed ah my dear i always knew you were on her side and thats why i sent for you today and why i said to your pretty wife when she proposed to come with you no my dear im pining to see newland and i dont want anybody to share our transports for you see my dear she drew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted and looked him full in the eyesyou see we shall have a fight yet the family dont want her here and theyll say its because ive been ill because im a weak old woman that shes persuaded me im not well enough yet to fight them one by one and youve got to do it for me i he stammered you why not she jerked back at him her round eyes suddenly as sharp as penknives her hand fluttered from its chairarm and lit on his with a clutch of little pale nails like birdclaws why not she searchingly repeated archer under the exposure of her gaze had recovered his selfpossession oh i dont countim too insignificant well youre letterblairs partner aint you youve got to get at them through letterblair unless youve got a reason she insisted oh my dear i back you to hold your own against them all without my help but you shall have it if you need it he reassured her then were safe she sighed and smiling on him with all her ancient cunning she added as she settled her head among the cushions i always knew youd back us up because they never quote you when they talk about its being her duty to go home he winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity and longed to ask and maydo they quote her but he judged it safer to turn the question and madame olenska when am i to see her he said the old lady chuckled crumpled her lids and went through the pantomime of archness not today one at a time please madame olenskas gone out he flushed with disappointment and she went on shes gone out my child gone in my carriage to see regina beaufort she paused for this announcement to produce its effect thats what shes reduced me to already the day after she got here she put on her best bonnet and told me as cool as a cucumber that she was going to call on regina beaufort i dont know her who is she says i shes your grandniece and a most unhappy woman she says shes the wife of a scoundrel i answered well she says and so am i and yet all my family want me to go back to him well that floored me and i let her go and finally one day she said it was raining too hard to go out on foot and she wanted me to lend her my carriage what for i asked her and she said to go and see cousin reginacousin now my dear i looked out of the window and saw it wasnt raining a drop but i understood her and i let her have the carriage after all reginas a brave woman and so is she and ive always liked courage above everything archer bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay on his eheheh whose hand did you think you were kissing young manyour wifes i hope the old lady snapped out with her mocking cackle and as he rose to go she called out after him give her her grannys love but youd better not say anything about our talk archer had been stunned by old catherines news it was only natural that madame olenska should have hastened from washington in response to her grandmothers summons but that she should have decided to remain under her roofespecially now that mrs mingott had almost regained her healthwas less easy to explain archer was sure that madame olenskas decision had not been influenced by the change in her financial situation he knew the exact figure of the small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation without the addition of her grandmothers allowance it was hardly enough to live on in any sense known to the mingott vocabulary and now that medora manson who shared her life had been ruined such a pittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed yet archer was convinced that madame olenska had not accepted her grandmothers offer from interested motives she had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of persons used to large fortunes and indifferent to money but she could go without many things which her relations considered indispensable and mrs lovell mingott and mrs welland had often been heard to deplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of count olenskis establishments should care so little about how things were done moreover as archer knew several months had passed since her allowance had been cut off yet in the interval she had made no effort to regain her grandmothers favour therefore if she had changed her course it must be for a different reason he did not have far to seek for that reason on the way from the ferry she had told him that he and she must remain apart but she had said it with her head on his breast he knew that there was no calculated coquetry in her words she was fighting her fate as he had fought his and clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break faith with the people who trusted them but during the ten days which had elapsed since her return to new york she had perhaps guessed from his silence and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her that he was meditating a decisive step a step from which there was no turning back at the thought a sudden fear of her own weakness might have seized her and she might have felt that after all it was better to accept the compromise usual in such cases and follow the line of least resistance an hour earlier when he had rung mrs mingotts bell archer had fancied that his path was clear before him he had meant to have a word alone with madame olenska and failing that to learn from her grandmother on what day and by which train she was returning to washington in that train he intended to join her and travel with her to washington or as much farther as she was willing to go his own fancy inclined to japan at any rate she would understand at once that wherever she went he was going he meant to leave a note for may that should cut off any other alternative he had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to take it yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was changed had been one of relief now however as he walked home from mrs mingotts he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay before him there was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was presumably to tread but when he had trodden it before it was as a free man who was accountable to no one for his actions and could lend himself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and prevarications concealments and compliances that the part required this procedure was called protecting a womans honour and the best fiction combined with the afterdinner talk of his elders had long since initiated him into every detail of its code now he saw the matter in a new light and his part in it seemed singularly diminished it was in fact that which with a secret fatuity he had watched mrs thorley rushworth play toward a fond and unperceiving husband a smiling bantering humouring watchful and incessant lie a lie by day a lie by night a lie in every touch and every look a lie in every caress and every quarrel a lie in every word and in every silence it was easier and less dastardly on the whole for a wife to play such a part toward her husband a womans standard of truthfulness was tacitly held to be lower she was the subject creature and versed in the arts of the enslaved then she could always plead moods and nerves and the right not to be held too strictly to account and even in the most straitlaced societies the laugh was always against the husband but in archers little world no one laughed at a wife deceived and a certain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their philandering after marriage in the rotation of crops there was a recognised season for wild oats but they were not to be sown more than once archer had always shared this view in his heart he thought lefferts despicable but to love ellen olenska was not to become a man like lefferts for the first time archer found himself face to face with the dread argument of the individual case ellen olenska was like no other woman he was like no other man their situation therefore resembled no one elses and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of their own judgment yes but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep and there were may and habit and honour and all the old decencies that he and his people had always believed in at his corner he hesitated and then walked on down fifth avenue ahead of him in the winter night loomed a big unlit house as he drew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights its steps awninged and carpeted and carriages waiting in double line to draw up at the curbstone it was in the conservatory that stretched its deadblack bulk down the side street that he had taken his first kiss from may it was under the myriad candles of the ballroom that he had seen her appear tall and silvershining as a young diana now the house was as dark as the grave except for a faint flare of gas in the basement and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had not been lowered as archer reached the corner he saw that the carriage standing at the door was mrs manson mingotts what an opportunity for sillerton jackson if he should chance to pass archer had been greatly moved by old catherines account of madame olenskas attitude toward mrs beaufort it made the righteous reprobation of new york seem like a passing by on the other side but he knew well enough what construction the clubs and drawingrooms would put on ellen olenskas visits to her cousin he paused and looked up at the lighted window no doubt the two women were sitting together in that room beaufort had probably sought consolation elsewhere there were even rumours that he had left new york with fanny ring but mrs beauforts attitude made the report seem improbable archer had the nocturnal perspective of fifth avenue almost to himself at that hour most people were indoors dressing for dinner and he was secretly glad that ellens exit was likely to be unobserved as the thought passed through his mind the door opened and she came out behind her was a faint light such as might have been carried down the stairs to show her the way she turned to say a word to some one then the door closed and she came down the steps ellen he said in a low voice as she reached the pavement she stopped with a slight start and just then he saw two young men of fashionable cut approaching there was a familiar air about their overcoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their white ties and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be dining out so early then he remembered that the reggie chiverses whose house was a few doors above were taking a large party that evening to see adelaide neilson in romeo and juliet and guessed that the two were of the number they passed under a lamp and he recognised lawrence lefferts and a young chivers a mean desire not to have madame olenska seen at the beauforts door vanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand i shall see you nowwe shall be together he broke out hardly knowing what he said ah she answered granny has told you while he watched her he was aware that lefferts and chivers on reaching the farther side of the street corner had discreetly struck away across fifth avenue it was the kind of masculine solidarity that he himself often practised now he sickened at their connivance did she really imagine that he and she could live like this and if not what else did she imagine tomorrow i must see yousomewhere where we can be alone he said in a voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears she wavered and moved toward the carriage but i shall be at grannysfor the present that is she added as if conscious that her change of plans required some explanation somewhere where we can be alone he insisted she gave a faint laugh that grated on him in new york but there are no churches no monuments theres the art museumin the park he explained as she looked puzzled at halfpast two i shall be at the door she turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage as it drove off she leaned forward and he thought she waved her hand in the obscurity he stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory feelings it seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman he loved but to another a woman he was indebted to for pleasures already wearied of it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this hackneyed vocabulary shell come he said to himself almost contemptuously avoiding the popular wolfe collection whose anecdotic canvases filled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of castiron and encaustic tiles known as the metropolitan museum they had wandered down a passage to the room where the cesnola antiquities mouldered in unvisited loneliness they had this melancholy retreat to themselves and seated on the divan enclosing the central steamradiator they were staring silently at the glass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered fragments of ilium its odd madame olenska said i never came here before ah well some day i suppose it will be a great museum yes she assented absently she stood up and wandered across the room archer remaining seated watched the light movements of her figure so girlish even under its heavy furs the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap and the way a dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the ear his mind as always when they first met was wholly absorbed in the delicious details that made her herself and no other presently he rose and approached the case before which she stood its glass shelves were crowded with small broken objectshardly recognisable domestic utensils ornaments and personal triflesmade of glass of clay of discoloured bronze and other timeblurred substances it seems cruel she said that after a while nothing matters any more than these little things that used to be necessary and important to forgotten people and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying glass and labelled use unknown yes but meanwhile ah meanwhile as she stood there in her long sealskin coat her hands thrust in a small round muff her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the tip of her nose and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring with her quicklytaken breath it seemed incredible that this pure harmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change meanwhile everything mattersthat concerns you he said she looked at him thoughtfully and turned back to the divan he sat down beside her and waited but suddenly he heard a step echoing far off down the empty rooms and felt the pressure of the minutes what is it you wanted to tell me she asked as if she had received the same warning what i wanted to tell you he rejoined why that i believe you came to new york because you were afraid afraid of my coming to washington she looked down at her muff and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily well wellyes she said you were afraid you knew yes i knew well then he insisted well then this is better isnt it she returned with a long questioning sigh better we shall hurt others less isnt it after all what you always wanted to have you here you meanin reach and yet out of reach to meet you in this way on the sly its the very reverse of what i want i told you the other day what i wanted she hesitated and you still think thisworse a thousand times he paused it would be easy to lie to you but the truth is i think it detestable oh so do i she cried with a deep breath of relief he sprang up impatiently well thenits my turn to ask what is it in gods name that you think better she hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her muff the step drew nearer and a guardian in a braided cap walked listlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis they fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them and when the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and sarcophagi archer spoke again what do you think better instead of answering she murmured i promised granny to stay with her because it seemed to me that here i should be safer from me she bent her head slightly without looking at him safer from loving me her profile did not stir but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and hang in a mesh of her veil safer from doing irreparable harm dont let us be like all the others she protested what others i dont profess to be different from my kind im consumed by the same wants and the same longings she glanced at him with a kind of terror and he saw a faint colour steal into her cheeks shall ionce come to you and then go home she suddenly hazarded in a low clear voice the blood rushed to the young mans forehead dearest he said without moving it seemed as if he held his heart in his hands like a full cup that the least motion might overbrim then her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded go home what do you mean by going home home to my husband and you expect me to say yes to that she raised her troubled eyes to his what else is there i cant stay here and lie to the people whove been good to me but thats the very reason why i ask you to come away and destroy their lives when theyve helped me to remake mine archer sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate despair it would have been easy to say yes come come once he knew the power she would put in his hands if she consented there would be no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband but something silenced the word on his lips a sort of passionate honesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her into that familiar trap if i were to let her come he said to himself i should have to let her go again and that was not to be imagined but he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek and wavered after all he began again we have lives of our own theres no use attempting the impossible youre so unprejudiced about some things so used as you say to looking at the gorgon that i dont know why youre afraid to face our case and see it as it really isunless you think the sacrifice is not worth making she stood up also her lips tightening under a rapid frown call it that theni must go she said drawing her little watch from her bosom she turned away and he followed and caught her by the wrist well then come to me once he said his head turning suddenly at the thought of losing her and for a second or two they looked at each other almost like enemies when he insisted tomorrow she hesitated the day after dearest he said again she had disengaged her wrist but for a moment they continued to hold each others eyes and he saw that her face which had grown very pale was flooded with a deep inner radiance his heart beat with awe he felt that he had never before beheld love visible oh i shall be lategoodbye no dont come any farther than this she cried walking hurriedly away down the long room as if the reflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her when she reached the door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell archer walked home alone darkness was falling when he let himself into his house and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall as if he viewed them from the other side of the grave the parlourmaid hearing his step ran up the stairs to light the gas on the upper landing is mrs archer in no sir mrs archer went out in the carriage after luncheon and hasnt come back with a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in his armchair the parlourmaid followed bringing the student lamp and shaking some coals onto the dying fire when she left he continued to sit motionless his elbows on his knees his chin on his clasped hands his eyes fixed on the red grate he sat there without conscious thoughts without sense of the lapse of time in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather than quicken it this was what had to be then this was what had to be he kept repeating to himself as if he hung in the clutch of doom what he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a mortal chill in his rapture the door opened and may came in im dreadfully lateyou werent worried were you she asked laying her hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses he looked up astonished is it late after seven i believe youve been asleep she laughed and drawing out her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa she looked paler than usual but sparkling with an unwonted animation i went to see granny and just as i was going away ellen came in from a walk so i stayed and had a long talk with her it was ages since wed had a real talk she had dropped into her usual armchair facing his and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair he fancied she expected him to speak a really good talk she went on smiling with what seemed to archer an unnatural vividness she was so dearjust like the old ellen im afraid i havent been fair to her lately ive sometimes thought archer stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece out of the radius of the lamp yes youve thought he echoed as she paused well perhaps i havent judged her fairly shes so differentat least on the surface she takes up such odd peopleshe seems to like to make herself conspicuous i suppose its the life shes led in that fast european society no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her but i dont want to judge her unfairly she paused again a little breathless with the unwonted length of her speech and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her cheeks archer as he looked at her was reminded of the glow which had suffused her face in the mission garden at st augustine he became aware of the same obscure effort in her the same reaching out toward something beyond the usual range of her vision she hates ellen he thought and shes trying to overcome the feeling and to get me to help her to overcome it the thought moved him and for a moment he was on the point of breaking the silence between them and throwing himself on her mercy you understand dont you she went on why the family have sometimes been annoyed we all did what we could for her at first but she never seemed to understand and now this idea of going to see mrs beaufort of going there in grannys carriage im afraid shes quite alienated the van der luydens ah said archer with an impatient laugh the open door had closed between them again its time to dress were dining out arent we he asked moving from the fire she rose also but lingered near the hearth as he walked past her she moved forward impulsively as though to detain him their eyes met and he saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her to drive to jersey city she flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his you havent kissed me today she said in a whisper and he felt her tremble in his arms at the court of the tuileries said mr sillerton jackson with his reminiscent smile such things were pretty openly tolerated the scene was the van der luydens black walnut diningroom in madison avenue and the time the evening after newland archers visit to the museum of art mr and mrs van der luyden had come to town for a few days from skuytercliff whither they had precipitately fled at the announcement of beauforts failure it had been represented to them that the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable affair made their presence in town more necessary than ever it was one of the occasions when as mrs archer put it they owed it to society to show themselves at the opera and even to open their own doors it will never do my dear louisa to let people like mrs lemuel struthers think they can step into reginas shoes it is just at such times that new people push in and get a footing it was owing to the epidemic of chickenpox in new york the winter mrs struthers first appeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their wives were in the nursery you and dear henry louisa must stand in the breach as you always have mr and mrs van der luyden could not remain deaf to such a call and reluctantly but heroically they had come to town unmuffled the house and sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception on this particular evening they had invited sillerton jackson mrs archer and newland and his wife to go with them to the opera where faust was being sung for the first time that winter nothing was done without ceremony under the van der luyden roof and though there were but four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually so that the proper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the gentlemen settled down to their cigars archer had not seen his wife since the evening before he had left early for the office where he had plunged into an accumulation of unimportant business in the afternoon one of the senior partners had made an unexpected call on his time and he had reached home so late that may had preceded him to the van der luydens and sent back the carriage now across the skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate she struck him as pale and languid but her eyes shone and she talked with exaggerated animation the subject which had called forth mr sillerton jacksons favourite allusion had been brought up archer fancied not without intention by their hostess the beaufort failure or rather the beaufort attitude since the failure was still a fruitful theme for the drawingroom moralist and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned mrs van der luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on may archer is it possible dear that what i hear is true i was told your grandmother mingotts carriage was seen standing at mrs beauforts door it was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady by her christian name mays colour rose and mrs archer put in hastily if it was im convinced it was there without mrs mingotts knowledge ah you think mrs van der luyden paused sighed and glanced at her husband im afraid mr van der luyden said that madame olenskas kind heart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on mrs beaufort or her taste for peculiar people put in mrs archer in a dry tone while her eyes dwelt innocently on her sons im sorry to think it of madame olenska said mrs van der luyden and mrs archer murmured ah my dearand after youd had her twice at skuytercliff it was at this point that mr jackson seized the chance to place his favourite allusion at the tuileries he repeated seeing the eyes of the company expectantly turned on him the standard was excessively lax in some respects and if youd asked where mornys money came from or who paid the debts of some of the court beauties i hope dear sillerton said mrs archer you are not suggesting that we should adopt such standards i never suggest returned mr jackson imperturbably but madame olenskas foreign bringingup may make her less particular ah the two elder ladies sighed still to have kept her grandmothers carriage at a defaulters door mr van der luyden protested and archer guessed that he was remembering and resenting the hampers of carnations he had sent to the little house in twentythird street of course ive always said that she looks at things quite differently mrs archer summed up a flush rose to mays forehead she looked across the table at her husband and said precipitately im sure ellen meant it kindly imprudent people are often kind said mrs archer as if the fact were scarcely an extenuation and mrs van der luyden murmured if only she had consulted some one ah that she never did mrs archer rejoined at this point mr van der luyden glanced at his wife who bent her head slightly in the direction of mrs archer and the glimmering trains of the three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down to their cigars mr van der luyden supplied short ones on opera nights but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his inexorable punctuality archer after the first act had detached himself from the party and made his way to the back of the club box from there he watched over various chivers mingott and rushworth shoulders the same scene that he had looked at two years previously on the night of his first meeting with ellen olenska he had halfexpected her to appear again in old mrs mingotts box but it remained empty and he sat motionless his eyes fastened on it till suddenly madame nilssons pure soprano broke out into mama non mama archer turned to the stage where in the familiar setting of giant roses and penwiper pansies the same large blonde victim was succumbing to the same small brown seducer from the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where may sat between two older ladies just as on that former evening she had sat between mrs lovell mingott and her newlyarrived foreign cousin as on that evening she was all in white and archer who had not noticed what she wore recognised the bluewhite satin and old lace of her wedding dress it was the custom in old new york for brides to appear in this costly garment during the first year or two of marriage his mother he knew kept hers in tissue paper in the hope that janey might some day wear it though poor janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and no bridesmaids would be thought more appropriate it struck archer that may since their return from europe had seldom worn her bridal satin and the surprise of seeing her in it made him compare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with such blissful anticipations two years earlier though mays outline was slightly heavier as her goddesslike build had foretold her athletic erectness of carriage and the girlish transparency of her expression remained unchanged but for the slight languor that archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the exact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of liliesofthevalley on her betrothal evening the fact seemed an additional appeal to his pity such innocence was as moving as the trustful clasp of a child then he remembered the passionate generosity latent under that incurious calm he recalled her glance of understanding when he had urged that their engagement should be announced at the beaufort ball he heard the voice in which she had said in the mission garden i couldnt have my happiness made out of a wronga wrong to some one else and an uncontrollable longing seized him to tell her the truth to throw himself on her generosity and ask for the freedom he had once refused newland archer was a quiet and selfcontrolled young man conformity to the discipline of a small society had become almost his second nature it was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic and conspicuous anything mr van der luyden would have deprecated and the club box condemned as bad form but he had become suddenly unconscious of the club box of mr van der luyden of all that had so long enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit he walked along the semicircular passage at the back of the house and opened the door of mrs van der luydens box as if it had been a gate into the unknown mama thrilled out the triumphant marguerite and the occupants of the box looked up in surprise at archers entrance he had already broken one of the rules of his world which forbade the entering of a box during a solo slipping between mr van der luyden and sillerton jackson he leaned over his wife ive got a beastly headache dont tell any one but come home wont you he whispered may gave him a glance of comprehension and he saw her whisper to his mother who nodded sympathetically then she murmured an excuse to mrs van der luyden and rose from her seat just as marguerite fell into fausts arms archer while he helped her on with her opera cloak noticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies as they drove away may laid her hand shyly on his im so sorry you dont feel well im afraid theyve been overworking you again at the office noits not that do you mind if i open the window he returned confusedly letting down the pane on his side he sat staring out into the street feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful interrogation and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing houses at their door she caught her skirt in the step of the carriage and fell against him did you hurt yourself he asked steadying her with his arm no but my poor dresssee how ive torn it she exclaimed she bent to gather up a mudstained breadth and followed him up the steps into the hall the servants had not expected them so early and there was only a glimmer of gas on the upper landing archer mounted the stairs turned up the light and put a match to the brackets on each side of the library mantelpiece the curtains were drawn and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of a familiar face met during an unavowable errand he noticed that his wife was very pale and asked if he should get her some brandy oh no she exclaimed with a momentary flush as she took off her cloak but hadnt you better go to bed at once she added as he opened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette archer threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the fire no my head is not as bad as that he paused and theres something i want to say something importantthat i must tell you at once she had dropped into an armchair and raised her head as he spoke yes dear she rejoined so gently that he wondered at the lack of wonder with which she received this preamble may he began standing a few feet from her chair and looking over at her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable abyss the sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike hush and he repeated there is something ive got to tell you about myself she sat silent without a movement or a tremor of her lashes she was still extremely pale but her face had a curious tranquillity of expression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source archer checked the conventional phrases of selfaccusal that were crowding to his lips he was determined to put the case baldly without vain recrimination or excuse madame olenska he said but at the name his wife raised her hand as if to silence him as she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of her weddingring oh why should we talk about ellen tonight she asked with a slight pout of impatience because i ought to have spoken before her face remained calm is it really worth while dear i know ive been unfair to her at timesperhaps we all have youve understood her no doubt better than we did youve always been kind to her but what does it matter now its all over archer looked at her blankly could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife all overwhat do you mean he asked in an indistinct stammer may still looked at him with transparent eyes whysince shes going back to europe so soon since granny approves and understands and has arranged to make her independent of her husband she broke off and archer grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in one convulsed hand and steadying himself against it made a vain effort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts i supposed he heard his wifes even voice go on that you had been kept at the office this evening about the business arrangements it was settled this morning i believe she lowered her eyes under his unseeing stare and another fugitive flush passed over her face he understood that his own eyes must be unbearable and turning away rested his elbows on the mantelshelf and covered his face something drummed and clanged furiously in his ears he could not tell if it were the blood in his veins or the tick of the clock on the mantel may sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out five minutes a lump of coal fell forward in the grate and hearing her rise to push it back archer at length turned and faced her its impossible he exclaimed impossible how do you knowwhat youve just told me i saw ellen yesterdayi told you id seen her at grannys it wasnt then that she told you no i had a note from her this afternoondo you want to see it he could not find his voice and she went out of the room and came back almost immediately i thought you knew she said simply she laid a sheet of paper on the table and archer put out his hand and took it up the letter contained only a few lines may dear i have at last made granny understand that my visit to her could be no more than a visit and she has been as kind and generous as ever she sees now that if i return to europe i must live by myself or rather with poor aunt medora who is coming with me i am hurrying back to washington to pack up and we sail next week you must be very good to granny when im goneas good as youve always been to me ellen if any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind please tell them it would be utterly useless archer read the letter over two or three times then he flung it down and burst out laughing the sound of his laugh startled him it recalled janeys midnight fright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over mays telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been advanced why did she write this he asked checking his laugh with a supreme effort may met the question with her unshaken candour i suppose because we talked things over yesterday what things i told her i was afraid i hadnt been fair to herhadnt always understood how hard it must have been for her here alone among so many people who were relations and yet strangers who felt the right to criticise and yet didnt always know the circumstances she paused i knew youd been the one friend she could always count on and i wanted her to know that you and i were the samein all our feelings she hesitated as if waiting for him to speak and then added slowly she understood my wishing to tell her this i think she understands everything she went up to archer and taking one of his cold hands pressed it quickly against her cheek my head aches too goodnight dear she said and turned to the door her torn and muddy weddingdress dragging after her across the room it was as mrs archer smilingly said to mrs welland a great event for a young couple to give their first big dinner the newland archers since they had set up their household had received a good deal of company in an informal way archer was fond of having three or four friends to dine and may welcomed them with the beaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in conjugal affairs her husband questioned whether if left to herself she would ever have asked any one to the house but he had long given up trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which tradition and training had moulded her it was expected that welloff young couples in new york should do a good deal of informal entertaining and a welland married to an archer was doubly pledged to the tradition but a big dinner with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen with roman punch roses from hendersons and menus on giltedged cards was a different affair and not to be lightly undertaken as mrs archer remarked the roman punch made all the difference not in itself but by its manifold implicationssince it signified either canvasbacks or terrapin two soups a hot and a cold sweet full decolletage with short sleeves and guests of a proportionate importance it was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their first invitations in the third person and their summons was seldom refused even by the seasoned and soughtafter still it was admittedly a triumph that the van der luydens at mays request should have stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the countess olenska the two mothersinlaw sat in mays drawingroom on the afternoon of the great day mrs archer writing out the menus on tiffanys thickest giltedged bristol while mrs welland superintended the placing of the palms and standard lamps archer arriving late from his office found them still there mrs archer had turned her attention to the namecards for the table and mrs welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large gilt sofa so that another corner might be created between the piano and the window may they told him was in the diningroom inspecting the mound of jacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table and the placing of the maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between the candelabra on the piano stood a large basket of orchids which mr van der luyden had had sent from skuytercliff everything was in short as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event mrs archer ran thoughtfully over the list checking off each name with her sharp gold pen henry van der luydenlouisathe lovell mingottsthe reggie chiverseslawrence lefferts and gertrudeyes i suppose may was right to have themthe selfridge merrys sillerton jackson van newland and his wife how time passes it seems only yesterday that he was your best man newlandand countess olenskayes i think thats all mrs welland surveyed her soninlaw affectionately no one can say newland that you and may are not giving ellen a handsome sendoff ah well said mrs archer i understand mays wanting her cousin to tell people abroad that were not quite barbarians im sure ellen will appreciate it she was to arrive this morning i believe it will make a most charming last impression the evening before sailing is usually so dreary mrs welland cheerfully continued archer turned toward the door and his motherinlaw called to him do go in and have a peep at the table and dont let may tire herself too much but he affected not to hear and sprang up the stairs to his library the room looked at him like an alien countenance composed into a polite grimace and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly tidied and prepared by a judicious distribution of ashtrays and cedarwood boxes for the gentlemen to smoke in ah well he thought its not for long and he went on to his dressingroom ten days had passed since madame olenskas departure from new york during those ten days archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed by the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper and sent to his office in a sealed envelope addressed in her hand this retort to his last appeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar game but the young man chose to give it a different meaning she was still fighting against her fate but she was going to europe and she was not returning to her husband nothing therefore was to prevent his following her and once he had taken the irrevocable step and had proved to her that it was irrevocable he believed she would not send him away this confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the present it had kept him from writing to her or betraying by any sign or act his misery and mortification it seemed to him that in the deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands and he waited there had been nevertheless moments sufficiently difficult to pass as when mr letterblair the day after madame olenskas departure had sent for him to go over the details of the trust which mrs manson mingott wished to create for her granddaughter for a couple of hours archer had examined the terms of the deed with his senior all the while obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some reason other than the obvious one of his cousinship and that the close of the conference would reveal it well the lady cant deny that its a handsome arrangement mr letterblair had summed up after mumbling over a summary of the settlement in fact im bound to say shes been treated pretty handsomely all round all round archer echoed with a touch of derision do you refer to her husbands proposal to give her back her own money mr letterblairs bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch my dear sir the laws the law and your wifes cousin was married under the french law its to be presumed she knew what that meant even if she did what happened subsequently but archer paused mr letterblair had laid his penhandle against his big corrugated nose and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous elderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that virtue is not synonymous with ignorance my dear sir ive no wish to extenuate the counts transgressions butbut on the other side i wouldnt put my hand in the fire well that there hadnt been tit for tat with the young champion mr letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded paper toward archer this report the result of discreet enquiries and then as archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to repudiate the suggestion the lawyer somewhat flatly continued i dont say its conclusive you observe far from it but straws show and on the whole its eminently satisfactory for all parties that this dignified solution has been reached oh eminently archer assented pushing back the paper a day or two later on responding to a summons from mrs manson mingott his soul had been more deeply tried he had found the old lady depressed and querulous you know shes deserted me she began at once and without waiting for his reply oh dont ask me why she gave so many reasons that ive forgotten them all my private belief is that she couldnt face the boredom at any rate thats what augusta and my daughtersinlaw think and i dont know that i altogether blame her olenskis a finished scoundrel but life with him must have been a good deal gayer than it is in fifth avenue not that the family would admit that they think fifth avenue is heaven with the rue de la paix thrown in and poor ellen of course has no idea of going back to her husband she held out as firmly as ever against that so shes to settle down in paris with that fool medora well paris is paris and you can keep a carriage there on next to nothing but she was as gay as a bird and i shall miss her two tears the parched tears of the old rolled down her puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom all i ask is she concluded that they shouldnt bother me any more i must really be allowed to digest my gruel and she twinkled a little wistfully at archer it was that evening on his return home that may announced her intention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin madame olenskas name had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight to washington and archer looked at his wife with surprise a dinnerwhy he interrogated her colour rose but you like elleni thought youd be pleased its awfully niceyour putting it in that way but i really dont see i mean to do it newland she said quietly rising and going to her desk here are the invitations all written mother helped meshe agrees that we ought to she paused embarrassed and yet smiling and archer suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the family oh all right he said staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand when he entered the drawingroom before dinner may was stooping over the fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed setting of immaculate tiles the tall lamps were all lit and mr van der luydens orchids had been conspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and knobby silver mrs newland archers drawingroom was generally thought a great success a gilt bamboo jardiniere in which the primulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed blocked the access to the bay window where the oldfashioned would have preferred a bronze reduction of the venus of milo the sofas and armchairs of pale brocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered with silver toys porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames and tall rosyshaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the palms i dont think ellen has ever seen this room lighted up said may rising flushed from her struggle and sending about her a glance of pardonable pride the brass tongs which she had propped against the side of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husbands answer and before he could restore them mr and mrs van der luyden were announced the other guests quickly followed for it was known that the van der luydens liked to dine punctually the room was nearly full and archer was engaged in showing to mrs selfridge merry a small highlyvarnished verbeckhoven study of sheep which mr welland had given may for christmas when he found madame olenska at his side she was excessively pale and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser and heavier than ever perhaps that or the fact that she had wound several rows of amber beads about her neck reminded him suddenly of the little ellen mingott he had danced with at childrens parties when medora manson had first brought her to new york the amber beads were trying to her complexion or her dress was perhaps unbecoming her face looked lustreless and almost ugly and he had never loved it as he did at that minute their hands met and he thought he heard her say yes were sailing tomorrow in the russia then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors and after an interval mays voice newland dinners been announced wont you please take ellen in madame olenska put her hand on his arm and he noticed that the hand was ungloved and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the evening that he had sat with her in the little twentythird street drawingroom all the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have taken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on his sleeve and he said to himself if it were only to see her hand again i should have to follow her it was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a foreign visitor that mrs van der luyden could suffer the diminution of being placed on her hosts left the fact of madame olenskas foreignness could hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell tribute and mrs van der luyden accepted her displacement with an affability which left no doubt as to her approval there were certain things that had to be done and if done at all done handsomely and thoroughly and one of these in the old new york code was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe there was nothing on earth that the wellands and mingotts would not have done to proclaim their unalterable affection for the countess olenska now that her passage for europe was engaged and archer at the head of his table sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her popularity had been retrieved grievances against her silenced her past countenanced and her present irradiated by the family approval mrs van der luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her nearest approach to cordiality and mr van der luyden from his seat at mays right cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify all the carnations he had sent from skuytercliff archer who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd imponderability as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and ceiling wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the proceedings as his glance travelled from one placid wellfed face to another he saw all the harmlesslooking people engaged upon mays canvasbacks as a band of dumb conspirators and himself and the pale woman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy and then it came over him in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams that to all of them he and madame olenska were lovers lovers in the extreme sense peculiar to foreign vocabularies he guessed himself to have been for months the centre of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears he understood that by means as yet unknown to him the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything or had ever imagined anything and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply may archers natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and cousin it was the old new york way of taking life without effusion of blood the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease who placed decency above courage and who considered that nothing was more illbred than scenes except the behaviour of those who gave rise to them as these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind archer felt like a prisoner in the centre of an armed camp he looked about the table and guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in which over the asparagus from florida they were dealing with beaufort and his wife its to show me he thought what would happen to me and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy over direct action and of silence over rash words closed in on him like the doors of the family vault he laughed and met mrs van der luydens startled eyes you think it laughable she said with a pinched smile of course poor reginas idea of remaining in new york has its ridiculous side i suppose and archer muttered of course at this point he became conscious that madame olenskas other neighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right at the same moment he saw that may serenely enthroned between mr van der luyden and mr selfridge merry had cast a quick glance down the table it was evident that the host and the lady on his right could not sit through the whole meal in silence he turned to madame olenska and her pale smile met him oh do lets see it through it seemed to say did you find the journey tiring he asked in a voice that surprised him by its naturalness and she answered that on the contrary she had seldom travelled with fewer discomforts except you know the dreadful heat in the train she added and he remarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the country she was going to i never he declared with intensity was more nearly frozen than once in april in the train between calais and paris she said she did not wonder but remarked that after all one could always carry an extra rug and that every form of travel had its hardships to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no account compared with the blessedness of getting away she changed colour and he added his voice suddenly rising in pitch i mean to do a lot of travelling myself before long a tremor crossed her face and leaning over to reggie chivers he cried out i say reggie what do you say to a trip round the world now next month i mean im game if you are at which mrs reggie piped up that she could not think of letting reggie go till after the martha washington ball she was getting up for the blind asylum in easter week and her husband placidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for the international polo match but mr selfridge merry had caught the phrase round the world and having once circled the globe in his steamyacht he seized the opportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning the shallowness of the mediterranean ports though after all he added it didnt matter for when youd seen athens and smyrna and constantinople what else was there and mrs merry said she could never be too grateful to dr bencomb for having made them promise not to go to naples on account of the fever but you must have three weeks to do india properly her husband conceded anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous globetrotter and at this point the ladies went up to the drawingroom in the library in spite of weightier presences lawrence lefferts predominated the talk as usual had veered around to the beauforts and even mr van der luyden and mr selfridge merry installed in the honorary armchairs tacitly reserved for them paused to listen to the younger mans philippic never had lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn christian manhood and exalt the sanctity of the home indignation lent him a scathing eloquence and it was clear that if others had followed his example and acted as he talked society would never have been weak enough to receive a foreign upstart like beaufortno sir not even if hed married a van der luyden or a lanning instead of a dallas and what chance would there have been lefferts wrathfully questioned of his marrying into such a family as the dallases if he had not already wormed his way into certain houses as people like mrs lemuel struthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake if society chose to open its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great though the gain was doubtful but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure origin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegrationand at no distant date if things go on at this pace lefferts thundered looking like a young prophet dressed by poole and who had not yet been stoned we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers houses and marrying beauforts bastards oh i saydraw it mild reggie chivers and young newland protested while mr selfridge merry looked genuinely alarmed and an expression of pain and disgust settled on mr van der luydens sensitive face has he got any cried mr sillerton jackson pricking up his ears and while lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh the old gentleman twittered into archers ear queer those fellows who are always wanting to set things right the people who have the worst cooks are always telling you theyre poisoned when they dine out but i hear there are pressing reasons for our friend lawrences diatribetypewriter this time i understand the talk swept past archer like some senseless river running and running because it did not know enough to stop he saw on the faces about him expressions of interest amusement and even mirth he listened to the younger mens laughter and to the praise of the archer madeira which mr van der luyden and mr merry were thoughtfully celebrating through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude of friendliness toward himself as if the guard of the prisoner he felt himself to be were trying to soften his captivity and the perception increased his passionate determination to be free in the drawingroom where they presently joined the ladies he met mays triumphant eyes and read in them the conviction that everything had gone off beautifully she rose from madame olenskas side and immediately mrs van der luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the gilt sofa where she throned mrs selfridge merry bore across the room to join them and it became clear to archer that here also a conspiracy of rehabilitation and obliteration was going on the silent organisation which held his little world together was determined to put itself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety of madame olenskas conduct or the completeness of archers domestic felicity all these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely engaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of suspected or even conceived possible the least hint to the contrary and from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation archer once more disengaged the fact that new york believed him to be madame olenskas lover he caught the glitter of victory in his wifes eyes and for the first time understood that she shared the belief the discovery roused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his efforts to discuss the martha washington ball with mrs reggie chivers and little mrs newland and so the evening swept on running and running like a senseless river that did not know how to stop at length he saw that madame olenska had risen and was saying goodbye he understood that in a moment she would be gone and tried to remember what he had said to her at dinner but he could not recall a single word they had exchanged she went up to may the rest of the company making a circle about her as she advanced the two young women clasped hands then may bent forward and kissed her cousin certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two archer heard reggie chivers say in an undertone to young mrs newland and he remembered beauforts coarse sneer at mays ineffectual beauty a moment later he was in the hall putting madame olenskas cloak about her shoulders through all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to say nothing that might startle or disturb her convinced that no power could now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events shape themselves as they would but as he followed madame olenska into the hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone with her at the door of her carriage is your carriage here he asked and at that moment mrs van der luyden who was being majestically inserted into her sables said gently we are driving dear ellen home archers heart gave a jerk and madame olenska clasping her cloak and fan with one hand held out the other to him goodbye she said goodbyebut i shall see you soon in paris he answered aloudit seemed to him that he had shouted it oh she murmured if you and may could come mr van der luyden advanced to give her his arm and archer turned to mrs van der luyden for a moment in the billowy darkness inside the big landau he caught the dim oval of a face eyes shining steadilyand she was gone as he went up the steps he crossed lawrence lefferts coming down with his wife lefferts caught his host by the sleeve drawing back to let gertrude pass i say old chap do you mind just letting it be understood that im dining with you at the club tomorrow night thanks so much you old brick goodnight it did go off beautifully didnt it may questioned from the threshold of the library archer roused himself with a start as soon as the last carriage had driven away he had come up to the library and shut himself in with the hope that his wife who still lingered below would go straight to her room but there she stood pale and drawn yet radiating the factitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue may i come and talk it over she asked of course if you like but you must be awfully sleepy no im not sleepy i should like to sit with you a little very well he said pushing her chair near the fire she sat down and he resumed his seat but neither spoke for a long time at length archer began abruptly since youre not tired and want to talk theres something i must tell you i tried to the other night she looked at him quickly yes dear something about yourself about myself you say youre not tired well i am horribly tired in an instant she was all tender anxiety oh ive seen it coming on newland youve been so wickedly overworked perhaps its that anyhow i want to make a break a break to give up the law to go away at any rateat once on a long trip ever so far offaway from everything he paused conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with the indifference of a man who longs for a change and is yet too weary to welcome it do what he would the chord of eagerness vibrated away from everything he repeated ever so far where for instance she asked oh i dont know indiaor japan she stood up and as he sat with bent head his chin propped on his hands he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him as far as that but im afraid you cant dear she said in an unsteady voice not unless youll take me with you and then as he was silent she went on in tones so clear and evenlypitched that each separate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain that is if the doctors will let me go but im afraid they wont for you see newland ive been sure since this morning of something ive been so longing and hoping for he looked up at her with a sick stare and she sank down all dew and roses and hid her face against his knee oh my dear he said holding her to him while his cold hand stroked her hair there was a long pause which the inner devils filled with strident laughter then may freed herself from his arms and stood up you didnt guess yesi no that is of course i hoped they looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent then turning his eyes from hers he asked abruptly have you told any one else only mamma and your mother she paused and then added hurriedly the blood flushing up to her forehead that isand ellen you know i told you wed had a long talk one afternoonand how dear she was to me ah said archer his heart stopping he felt that his wife was watching him intently did you mind my telling her first newland mind why should i he made a last effort to collect himself but that was a fortnight ago wasnt it i thought you said you werent sure till today her colour burned deeper but she held his gaze no i wasnt sure thenbut i told her i was and you see i was right she exclaimed her blue eyes wet with victory newland archer sat at the writingtable in his library in east thirtyninth street he had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration of the new galleries at the metropolitan museum and the spectacle of those great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages where the throng of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically catalogued treasures had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory why this used to be one of the old cesnola rooms he heard some one say and instantly everything about him vanished and he was sitting alone on a hard leather divan against a radiator while a slight figure in a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrelyfitted vista of the old museum the vision had roused a host of other associations and he sat looking with new eyes at the library which for over thirty years had been the scene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations it was the room in which most of the real things of his life had happened there his wife nearly twentysix years ago had broken to him with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young women of the new generation to smile the news that she was to have a child and there their eldest boy dallas too delicate to be taken to church in midwinter had been christened by their old friend the bishop of new york the ample magnificent irreplaceable bishop so long the pride and ornament of his diocese there dallas had first staggered across the floor shouting dad while may and the nurse laughed behind the door there their second child mary who was so like her mother had announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of reggie chiverss many sons and there archer had kissed her through her wedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them to grace churchfor in a world where all else had reeled on its foundations the grace church wedding remained an unchanged institution it was in the library that he and may had always discussed the future of the children the studies of dallas and his young brother bill marys incurable indifference to accomplishments and passion for sport and philanthropy and the vague leanings toward art which had finally landed the restless and curious dallas in the office of a rising new york architect the young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and business and taking up all sorts of new things if they were not absorbed in state politics or municipal reform the chances were that they were going in for central american archaeology for architecture or landscapeengineering taking a keen and learned interest in the prerevolutionary buildings of their own country studying and adapting georgian types and protesting at the meaningless use of the word colonial nobody nowadays had colonial houses except the millionaire grocers of the suburbs but above allsometimes archer put it above allit was in that library that the governor of new york coming down from albany one evening to dine and spend the night had turned to his host and said banging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eyeglasses hang the professional politician youre the kind of man the country wants archer if the stables ever to be cleaned out men like you have got to lend a hand in the cleaning men like you how archer had glowed at the phrase how eagerly he had risen up at the call it was an echo of ned winsetts old appeal to roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck but spoken by a man who set the example of the gesture and whose summons to follow him was irresistible archer as he looked back was not sure that men like himself were what his country needed at least in the active service to which theodore roosevelt had pointed in fact there was reason to think it did not for after a year in the state assembly he had not been reelected and had dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work and from that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the reforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its apathy it was little enough to look back on but when he remembered to what the young men of his generation and his set had looked forwardthe narrow groove of moneymaking sport and society to which their vision had been limitedeven his small contribution to the new state of things seemed to count as each brick counts in a wellbuilt wall he had done little in public life he would always be by nature a contemplative and a dilettante but he had had high things to contemplate great things to delight in and one great mans friendship to be his strength and pride he had been in short what people were beginning to call a good citizen in new york for many years past every new movement philanthropic municipal or artistic had taken account of his opinion and wanted his name people said ask archer when there was a question of starting the first school for crippled children reorganising the museum of art founding the grolier club inaugurating the new library or getting up a new society of chamber music his days were full and they were filled decently he supposed it was all a man ought to ask something he knew he had missed the flower of life but he thought of it now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined would have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first prize in a lottery there were a hundred million tickets in his lottery and there was only one prize the chances had been too decidedly against him when he thought of ellen olenska it was abstractly serenely as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed that vision faint and tenuous as it was had kept him from thinking of other women he had been what was called a faithful husband and when may had suddenly diedcarried off by the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest childhe had honestly mourned her their long years together had shown him that it did not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty as long as it kept the dignity of a duty lapsing from that it became a mere battle of ugly appetites looking about him he honoured his own past and mourned for it after all there was good in the old ways his eyes making the round of the roomdone over by dallas with english mezzotints chippendale cabinets bits of chosen blueandwhite and pleasantly shaded electric lampscame back to the old eastlake writingtable that he had never been willing to banish and to his first photograph of may which still kept its place beside his inkstand there she was tall roundbosomed and willowy in her starched muslin and flapping leghorn as he had seen her under the orangetrees in the mission garden and as he had seen her that day so she had remained never quite at the same height yet never far below it generous faithful unwearied but so lacking in imagination so incapable of growth that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change this hard bright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered her incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their views from her as archer concealed his there had been from the first a joint pretence of sameness a kind of innocent family hypocrisy in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated and she had died thinking the world a good place full of loving and harmonious households like her own and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that whatever happened newland would continue to inculcate in dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents lives and that dallas in turn when newland followed her would transmit the sacred trust to little bill and of mary she was sure as of her own self so having snatched little bill from the grave and given her life in the effort she went contentedly to her place in the archer vault in st marks where mrs archer already lay safe from the terrifying trend which her daughterinlaw had never even become aware of opposite mays portrait stood one of her daughter mary chivers was as tall and fair as her mother but largewaisted flatchested and slightly slouching as the altered fashion required mary chiverss mighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the twentyinch waist that may archers azure sash so easily spanned and the difference seemed symbolic the mothers life had been as closely girt as her figure mary who was no less conventional and no more intelligent yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views there was good in the new order too the telephone clicked and archer turning from the photographs unhooked the transmitter at his elbow how far they were from the days when the legs of the brassbuttoned messenger boy had been new yorks only means of quick communication chicago wants you ahit must be a longdistance from dallas who had been sent to chicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the lakeside palace they were to build for a young millionaire with ideas the firm always sent dallas on such errands hallo dadyes dallas i sayhow do you feel about sailing on wednesday mauretania yes next wednesday as ever is our client wants me to look at some italian gardens before we settle anything and has asked me to nip over on the next boat ive got to be back on the first of june the voice broke into a joyful conscious laughso we must look alive i say dad i want your help do come dallas seemed to be speaking in the room the voice was as near by and natural as if he had been lounging in his favourite armchair by the fire the fact would not ordinarily have surprised archer for longdistance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as electric lighting and fiveday atlantic voyages but the laugh did startle him it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and miles of countryforest river mountain prairie roaring cities and busy indifferent millionsdallass laugh should be able to say of course whatever happens i must get back on the first because fanny beaufort and i are to be married on the fifth the voice began again think it over no sir not a minute youve got to say yes now why not id like to know if you can allege a single reasonno i knew it then its a go eh because i count on you to ring up the cunard office first thing tomorrow and youd better book a return on a boat from marseilles i say dad itll be our last time together in this kind of way oh good i knew you would chicago rang off and archer rose and began to pace up and down the room it would be their last time together in this kind of way the boy was right they would have lots of other times after dallass marriage his father was sure for the two were born comrades and fanny beaufort whatever one might think of her did not seem likely to interfere with their intimacy on the contrary from what he had seen of her he thought she would be naturally included in it still change was change and differences were differences and much as he felt himself drawn toward his future daughterinlaw it was tempting to seize this last chance of being alone with his boy there was no reason why he should not seize it except the profound one that he had lost the habit of travel may had disliked to move except for valid reasons such as taking the children to the sea or in the mountains she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in thirtyninth street or their comfortable quarters at the wellands in newport after dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty to travel for six months and the whole family had made the oldfashioned tour through england switzerland and italy their time being limited no one knew why they had omitted france archer remembered dallass wrath at being asked to contemplate mont blanc instead of rheims and chartres but mary and bill wanted mountainclimbing and had already yawned their way in dallass wake through the english cathedrals and may always fair to her children had insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and artistic proclivities she had indeed proposed that her husband should go to paris for a fortnight and join them on the italian lakes after they had done switzerland but archer had declined well stick together he said and mays face had brightened at his setting such a good example to dallas since her death nearly two years before there had been no reason for his continuing in the same routine his children had urged him to travel mary chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad and see the galleries the very mysteriousness of such a cure made her the more confident of its efficacy but archer had found himself held fast by habit by memories by a sudden startled shrinking from new things now as he reviewed his past he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk the worst of doing ones duty was that it apparently unfitted one for doing anything else at least that was the view that the men of his generation had taken the trenchant divisions between right and wrong honest and dishonest respectable and the reverse had left so little scope for the unforeseen there are moments when a mans imagination so easily subdued to what it lives in suddenly rises above its daily level and surveys the long windings of destiny archer hung there and wondered what was left of the little world he had grown up in and whose standards had bent and bound him he remembered a sneering prophecy of poor lawrence leffertss uttered years ago in that very room if things go on at this rate our children will be marrying beauforts bastards it was just what archers eldest son the pride of his life was doing and nobody wondered or reproved even the boys aunt janey who still looked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth had taken her mothers emeralds and seedpearls out of their pink cottonwool and carried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride and fanny beaufort instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a set from a paris jeweller had exclaimed at their oldfashioned beauty and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an isabey miniature fanny beaufort who had appeared in new york at eighteen after the death of her parents had won its heart much as madame olenska had won it thirty years earlier only instead of being distrustful and afraid of her society took her joyfully for granted she was pretty amusing and accomplished what more did any one want nobody was narrowminded enough to rake up against her the halfforgotten facts of her fathers past and her own origin only the older people remembered so obscure an incident in the business life of new york as beauforts failure or the fact that after his wifes death he had been quietly married to the notorious fanny ring and had left the country with his new wife and a little girl who inherited her beauty he was subsequently heard of in constantinople then in russia and a dozen years later american travellers were handsomely entertained by him in buenos ayres where he represented a large insurance agency he and his wife died there in the odour of prosperity and one day their orphaned daughter had appeared in new york in charge of may archers sisterinlaw mrs jack welland whose husband had been appointed the girls guardian the fact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with newland archers children and nobody was surprised when dallass engagement was announced nothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the world had travelled people nowadays were too busybusy with reforms and movements with fads and fetishes and frivolitiesto bother much about their neighbours and of what account was anybodys past in the huge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same plane newland archer looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety of the paris streets felt his heart beating with the confusion and eagerness of youth it was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening waistcoat leaving him the next minute with an empty breast and hot temples he wondered if it was thus that his sons conducted itself in the presence of miss fanny beaufortand decided that it was not it functions as actively no doubt but the rhythm is different he reflected recalling the cool composure with which the young man had announced his engagement and taken for granted that his family would approve the difference is that these young people take it for granted that theyre going to get whatever they want and that we almost always took it for granted that we shouldnt only i wonderthe thing ones so certain of in advance can it ever make ones heart beat as wildly it was the day after their arrival in paris and the spring sunshine held archer in his open window above the wide silvery prospect of the place vendome one of the things he had stipulatedalmost the only onewhen he had agreed to come abroad with dallas was that in paris he shouldnt be made to go to one of the newfangled palaces oh all rightof course dallas goodnaturedly agreed ill take you to some jolly oldfashioned placethe bristol say leaving his father speechless at hearing that the centurylong home of kings and emperors was now spoken of as an oldfashioned inn where one went for its quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour archer had pictured often enough in the first impatient years the scene of his return to paris then the personal vision had faded and he had simply tried to see the city as the setting of madame olenskas life sitting alone at night in his library after the household had gone to bed he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the avenues of horsechestnuts the flowers and statues in the public gardens the whiff of lilacs from the flowercarts the majestic roll of the river under the great bridges and the life of art and study and pleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting now the spectacle was before him in its glory and as he looked out on it he felt shy oldfashioned inadequate a mere grey speck of a man compared with the ruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being dallass hand came down cheerily on his shoulder hullo father this is something like isnt it they stood for a while looking out in silence and then the young man continued by the way ive got a message for you the countess olenska expects us both at halfpast five he said it lightly carelessly as he might have imparted any casual item of information such as the hour at which their train was to leave for florence the next evening archer looked at him and thought he saw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his greatgrandmother mingotts malice oh didnt i tell you dallas pursued fanny made me swear to do three things while i was in paris get her the score of the last debussy songs go to the grandguignol and see madame olenska you know she was awfully good to fanny when mr beaufort sent her over from buenos ayres to the assomption fanny hadnt any friends in paris and madame olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays i believe she was a great friend of the first mrs beauforts and shes our cousin of course so i rang her up this morning before i went out and told her you and i were here for two days and wanted to see her archer continued to stare at him you told her i was here of coursewhy not dallass eye brows went up whimsically then getting no answer he slipped his arm through his fathers with a confidential pressure i say father what was she like archer felt his colour rise under his sons unabashed gaze come own up you and she were great pals werent you wasnt she most awfully lovely lovely i dont know she was different ahthere you have it thats what it always comes to doesnt it when she comes shes differentand one doesnt know why its exactly what i feel about fanny his father drew back a step releasing his arm about fanny but my dear fellowi should hope so only i dont see dash it dad dont be prehistoric wasnt sheonceyour fanny dallas belonged body and soul to the new generation he was the firstborn of newland and may archer yet it had never been possible to inculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve whats the use of making mysteries it only makes people want to nose em out he always objected when enjoined to discretion but archer meeting his eyes saw the filial light under their banter my fanny well the woman youd have chucked everything for only you didnt continued his surprising son i didnt echoed archer with a kind of solemnity no you date you see dear old boy but mother said your mother yes the day before she died it was when she sent for me aloneyou remember she said she knew we were safe with you and always would be because once when she asked you to youd given up the thing you most wanted archer received this strange communication in silence his eyes remained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the window at length he said in a low voice she never asked me no i forgot you never did ask each other anything did you and you never told each other anything you just sat and watched each other and guessed at what was going on underneath a deafanddumb asylum in fact well i back your generation for knowing more about each others private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about our owni say dad dallas broke off youre not angry with me if you are lets make it up and go and lunch at henris ive got to rush out to versailles afterward archer did not accompany his son to versailles he preferred to spend the afternoon in solitary roamings through paris he had to deal all at once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate lifetime after a little while he did not regret dallass indiscretion it seemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that after all some one had guessed and pitied and that it should have been his wife moved him indescribably dallas for all his affectionate insight would not have understood that to the boy no doubt the episode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration of wasted forces but was it really no more for a long time archer sat on a bench in the champs elysees and wondered while the stream of life rolled by a few streets away a few hours away ellen olenska waited she had never gone back to her husband and when he had died some years before she had made no change in her way of living there was nothing now to keep her and archer apartand that afternoon he was to see her he got up and walked across the place de la concorde and the tuileries gardens to the louvre she had once told him that she often went there and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place where he could think of her as perhaps having lately been for an hour or more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of afternoon light and one by one the pictures burst on him in their halfforgotten splendour filling his soul with the long echoes of beauty after all his life had been too starved suddenly before an effulgent titian he found himself saying but im only fiftyseven and then he turned away for such summer dreams it was too late but surely not for a quiet harvest of friendship of comradeship in the blessed hush of her nearness he went back to the hotel where he and dallas were to meet and together they walked again across the place de la concorde and over the bridge that leads to the chamber of deputies dallas unconscious of what was going on in his fathers mind was talking excitedly and abundantly of versailles he had had but one previous glimpse of it during a holiday trip in which he had tried to pack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with the family to switzerland and tumultuous enthusiasm and cocksure criticism tripped each other up on his lips as archer listened his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness increased the boy was not insensitive he knew but he had the facility and selfconfidence that came of looking at fate not as a master but as an equal thats it they feel equal to thingsthey know their way about he mused thinking of his son as the spokesman of the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks and with them the signposts and the dangersignal suddenly dallas stopped short grasping his fathers arm oh by jove he exclaimed they had come out into the great treeplanted space before the invalides the dome of mansart floated ethereally above the budding trees and the long grey front of the building drawing up into itself all the rays of afternoon light it hung there like the visible symbol of the races glory archer knew that madame olenska lived in a square near one of the avenues radiating from the invalides and he had pictured the quarter as quiet and almost obscure forgetting the central splendour that lit it up now by some queer process of association that golden light became for him the pervading illumination in which she lived for nearly thirty years her lifeof which he knew so strangely littlehad been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to be too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs he thought of the theatres she must have been to the pictures she must have looked at the sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented the people she must have talked with the incessant stir of ideas curiosities images and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a setting of immemorial manners and suddenly he remembered the young frenchman who had once said to him ah good conversationthere is nothing like it is there archer had not seen m riviere or heard of him for nearly thirty years and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of madame olenskas existence more than half a lifetime divided them and she had spent the long interval among people he did not know in a society he but faintly guessed at in conditions he would never wholly understand during that time he had been living with his youthful memory of her but she had doubtless had other and more tangible companionship perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something apart but if she had it must have been like a relic in a small dim chapel where there was not time to pray every day they had crossed the place des invalides and were walking down one of the thoroughfares flanking the building it was a quiet quarter after all in spite of its splendour and its history and the fact gave one an idea of the riches paris had to draw on since such scenes as this were left to the few and the indifferent the day was fading into a soft sunshot haze pricked here and there by a yellow electric light and passers were rare in the little square into which they had turned dallas stopped again and looked up it must be here he said slipping his arm through his fathers with a movement from which archers shyness did not shrink and they stood together looking up at the house it was a modern building without distinctive character but manywindowed and pleasantly balconied up its wide creamcoloured front on one of the upper balconies which hung well above the rounded tops of the horsechestnuts in the square the awnings were still lowered as though the sun had just left it i wonder which floor dallas conjectured and moving toward the portecochere he put his head into the porters lodge and came back to say the fifth it must be the one with the awnings archer remained motionless gazing at the upper windows as if the end of their pilgrimage had been attained i say you know its nearly six his son at length reminded him the father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees i believe ill sit there a moment he said whyarent you well his son exclaimed oh perfectly but i should like you please to go up without me dallas paused before him visibly bewildered but i say dad do you mean you wont come up at all i dont know said archer slowly if you dont she wont understand go my boy perhaps i shall follow you dallas gave him a long look through the twilight but what on earth shall i say my dear fellow dont you always know what to say his father rejoined with a smile very well i shall say youre oldfashioned and prefer walking up the five flights because you dont like lifts his father smiled again say im oldfashioned thats enough dallas looked at him again and then with an incredulous gesture passed out of sight under the vaulted doorway archer sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony he calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor to ring the bell and be admitted to the hall and then ushered into the drawingroom he pictured dallas entering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful smile and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy took after him then he tried to see the persons already in the roomfor probably at that sociable hour there would be more than oneand among them a dark lady pale and dark who would look up quickly half rise and hold out a long thin hand with three rings on it he thought she would be sitting in a sofacorner near the fire with azaleas banked behind her on a table its more real to me here than if i went up he suddenly heard himself say and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other he sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk his eyes never turning from the balcony at length a light shone through the windows and a moment later a manservant came out on the balcony drew up the awnings and closed the shutters at that as if it had been the signal he waited for newland archer got up slowly and walked back alone to his hotel a note on the text the age of innocence first appeared in four large installments in the pictorial review from july to october 1920 it was published that same year in book form by d

catherine and raina realize the story is about them but do not say anything sergius speaks with louka in private and begins flirting with her louka reveals to sergius that raina might not remain faithful to sergius and sergius is taken aback they exit a man named bluntschli enters the family garden and louka brings him to catherine catherine realizes that he is the man that hid in rainas room the same man that she and raina helped escape catherine worries that sergius and petkoff who are conferring over military plans in the library might encounter the soldier sergius and petkoff have no idea that the story they heard about a soldier being helped by two bulgarian women involves the petkoffs bluntschli has come to return major petkoffs coat that catherine and raina lent him to escape raina is so happy to see him that she blurts out the chocolate cream soldier when she walks in the room only to recover herself and blame her outburst implausibly on nicola petkoff and sergius who have in fact already met bluntschli during the war ask bluntschli to stay and pass the time in the final act the various tensions of the play thus far are exposed louka tells sergius that the man with whom raina is in love is bluntschli sergius challenges bluntschli to a duel because of this but bluntschli explains his way out of it a picture of herself that raina placed in her fathers cloak for bluntschli to find is exposed proving that raina has not been entirely truthful to sergius raina admits that she has had feelings for bluntschli since they first met major petkoff is aghast when bluntschli acknowledges that he has loved raina sergius and louka reveal that they have been having a secret affair at sergius instigation and nicola releases louka from their engagement bluntschli whose father has just died has come into a great deal of money so rainas parents are glad to marry her off to him and his handsome fortune raina is revealed to be 23 rather than 17 enabling bluntschli in good conscience to ask for her hand in marriage bluntschli promises to hire nicola whom he admires to run the hotels he has just received as part of his inheritance sergius accepts louka as his lover in public thus satisfying loukas desire to move up in the social ranks the play ends with sergius exclaiming of bluntschli what a man\",\n          \"she stoops to conquer or the mistakes of a

discuss their son tony and the arrival of a young gentleman mr marlow whom they hope will be a suitable match for their daughter kate however it quickly becomes evident that marlows shyness with
