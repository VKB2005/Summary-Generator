unpardonable sin to have his characters make long speeches at one another apparently thinking that this embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of bombast and rhetoric there never was an author who showed less predilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results he recognized early in his days many things awry in the world and he assumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit it seems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright he began as an essayist but who reads essays nowadayshe then turned novelist with no better success for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he chose to emit he only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men and womenalthough he has created few of the lattercan be most extremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking as a last resort he turned to the stage not that he cared for the dramatic art for no man seems to care less about art for arts sake being in this a perfect foil to his brilliant compatriot and contemporary wilde he cast his theories in dramatic forms merely because no other course except silence or physical revolt was open to him for a long time it seemed as if this resource too was doomed to fail him but finally he has attained a hearing and now attempts at suppression merely serve to advertise their victim it will repay those who seek analogies in literature to compare shaw with cervantes after a life of heroic endeavor disappointment slavery and poverty the author of don quixote gave the world a serious work which caused to be laughed off the worlds stage forever the final vestiges of decadent chivalry the institution had long been outgrown but its vernacular continued to be the speech and to express the thought of the world and among the vulgar as the quaint old novelist puts it just as today the novel intended for the consumption of the unenlightened must deal with peers and millionaires and be dressed in stilted language marvellously he succeeded but in a way he least intended we have not yet after so many years determined whether it is a work to laugh or cry over it is our joyfullest modern book says carlyle while landor thinks that readers who see nothing more than a burlesque in don quixote have but shallow appreciation of the work shaw in like manner comes upon the scene when many of our social usages are outworn he sees the fact announces it and we burst into guffaws the continuous laughter which greets shaws plays arises from a real contrast in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences when pinero or jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a moment that the authors point of view is our own and that the abnormal predicament of his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his audience with shaw this sense of community of feeling is wholly lacking he describes things as he sees them and the house is in a roar who is right if we were really using our own senses and not gazing through the glasses of convention and romance and makebelieve should we see things as shaw does must it not cause shaw to doubt his own or the publics sanity to hear audiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations and yet if they did not come to laugh they would not come at all mockery is the price he must pay for a hearing or has he calculated to a nicety the power of reaction does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of sordidness to disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness to illusion by disillusionment it is impossible to believe that he is unconscious of the humor of his dramatic situations yet he stoically gives no sign he even dares the charge terrible in proportion to its truth which the most serious of us shrinks fromthe lack of a sense of humor men would rather have their integrity impugned in arms and the man the subject which occupies the dramatists attention is that survival of barbaritymilitarismwhich raises its horrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our civilization no more hoary superstition survives than that the donning of a uniform changes the nature of the wearer this notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon the stage acting rationally our conventionalized senses are shocked the only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently been there and of course mr shaw who has no illusions about anything it is hard to speak too highly of candida no equally subtle and incisive study of domestic relations exists in the english drama one has to turn to george merediths the egoist to find such character dissection the central note of the play is that with the true woman weakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than strength which offers protection candida is quite unpoetic as indeed with rare exceptions women are prone to be they have small delight in poetry but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made the husband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness the poet pitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth the hopelessly demoralized manufacturer the conventional and hence emotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be challenged to rival in the man of destiny the object of the dramatist is not so much the destruction as the explanation of the napoleonic tradition which has so powerfully influenced generation after generation for a century however the man may be regarded he was a miracle shaw shows that he achieved his extraordinary career by suspending for himself the pressure of the moral and conventional atmosphere while leaving it operative for others those who study this playextravaganza that it iswill attain a clearer comprehension of napoleon than they can get from all the biographies you never can tell offers an amusing study of the play of social conventions the twins illustrate the disconcerting effects of that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable gloria demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts the idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned crampton the father typifies the common superstition that among the privileges of parenthood are inflexibility tyranny and respect the last entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved the waiter william is the best illustration of the man who knows his place that the stage has seen he is the most pathetic figure of the play one touch of verisimilitude is lacking none of the guests gives him a tip yet he maintains his urbanity as mr shaw has not yet visited america he may be unaware of the improbability of this situation to those who regard literary men merely as purveyors of amusement for people who have not wit enough to entertain themselves ibsen and shaw maeterlinck and gorky must remain enigmas it is so much pleasanter to ignore than to face unpleasant realitiesto take riverside drive and not mulberry street as the exponent of our life and the expression of our civilization these men are the sappers and miners of the advancing army of justice the audience which demands the truth and despises the contemptible conventions that dominate alike our stage and our life is daily growing shaw and men like himif indeed he is not absolutely uniquewill not for the future lack a hearing m arms and the man act i night a ladys bedchamber in bulgaria in a small town near the dragoman pass it is late in november in the year 1885 and through an open window with a little balcony on the left can be seen a peak of the balkans wonderfully white and beautiful in the starlit snow the interior of the room is not like anything to be seen in the east of europe it is half rich bulgarian half cheap viennese the counterpane and hangings of the bed the window curtains the little carpet and all the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are oriental and gorgeous the paper on the walls is occidental and paltry above the head of the bed which stands against a little wall cutting off the right hand corner of the room diagonally is a painted wooden shrine blue and gold with an ivory image of christ and a light hanging before it in a pierced metal ball suspended by three chains on the left further forward is an ottoman the washstand against the wall on the left consists of an enamelled iron basin with a pail beneath it in a painted metal frame and a single towel on the rail at the side a chair near it is austrian bent wood with cane seat the dressing table between the bed and the window is an ordinary pine table covered with a cloth of many colors but with an expensive toilet mirror on it the door is on the right and there is a chest of drawers between the door and the bed this chest of drawers is also covered by a variegated native cloth and on it there is a pile of paper backed novels a box of chocolate creams and a miniature easel on which is a large photograph of an extremely handsome officer whose lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even from the portrait the room is lighted by a candle on the chest of drawers and another on the dressing table with a box of matches beside it the window is hinged doorwise and stands wide open folding back to the left outside a pair of wooden shutters opening outwards also stand open on the balcony a young lady intensely conscious of the romantic beauty of the night and of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part of it is on the balcony gazing at the snowy balkans she is covered by a long mantle of furs worth on a moderate estimate about three times the furniture of her room her reverie is interrupted by her mother catherine petkoff a woman over forty imperiously energetic with magnificent black hair and eyes who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife of a mountain farmer but is determined to be a viennese lady and to that end wears a fashionable tea gown on all occasions catherine entering hastily full of good news rainashe pronounces it raheena with the stress on the ee rainashe goes to the bed expecting to find raina there why whereraina looks into the room heavens child are you out in the night air instead of in your bed youll catch your death louka told me you were asleep raina coming in i sent her away i wanted to be alone the stars are so beautiful what is the matter catherine such news there has been a battle raina her eyes dilating ah she throws the cloak on the ottoman and comes eagerly to catherine in her nightgown a pretty garment but evidently the only one she has on catherine a great battle at slivnitza a victory and it was won by sergius raina with a cry of delight ah rapturously oh mother then with sudden anxiety is father safe catherine of course he sent me the news sergius is the hero of the hour the idol of the regiment raina tell me tell me how was it ecstatically oh mother mother mother raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman and they kiss one another frantically catherine with surging enthusiasm you cant guess how splendid it is a cavalry chargethink of that he defied our russian commandersacted without ordersled a charge on his own responsibilityheaded it himselfwas the first man to sweep through their guns cant you see it raina our gallant splendid bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing thundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched servian dandies like chaff and youyou kept sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him oh if you have a drop of bulgarian blood in your veins you will worship him when he comes back raina what will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole army of heroes but no matter i am so happyso proud she rises and walks about excitedly it proves that all our ideas were real after all catherine indignantly our ideas real what do you mean raina our ideas of what sergius would doour patriotismour heroic ideals oh what faithless little creatures girls arei sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams when i buckled on sergiuss sword he looked so noble it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure and yetand yetquickly promise me youll never tell him catherine dont ask me for promises until i know what i am promising raina well it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading byron and pushkin and because we were so delighted with the opera that season at bucharest real life is so seldom like thatindeed never as far as i knew it then remorsefully only think mother i doubted him i wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle i had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever russian officers catherine a poor figure shame on you the servians have austrian officers who are just as clever as our russians but we have beaten them in every battle for all that raina laughing and sitting down again yes i was only a prosaic little coward oh to think that it was all truethat sergius is just as splendid and noble as he looksthat the world is really a glorious world for women who can see its glory and men who can act its romance what happiness what unspeakable fulfilment ah she throws herself on her knees beside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her they are interrupted by the entry of louka a handsome proud girl in a pretty bulgarian peasants dress with double apron so defiant that her servility to raina is almost insolent she is afraid of catherine but even with her goes as far as she dares she is just now excited like the others but she has no sympathy for rainas raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies of the two before she addresses them louka if you please madam all the windows are to be closed and the shutters made fast they say there may be shooting in the streets raina and catherine rise together alarmed the servians are being chased right back through the pass and they say they may run into the town our cavalry will be after them and our people will be ready for them you may be sure now that they are running away she goes out on the balcony and pulls the outside shutters to then steps back into the room raina i wish our people were not so cruel what glory is there in killing wretched fugitives catherine businesslike her housekeeping instincts aroused i must see that everything is made safe downstairs raina to louka leave the shutters so that i can just close them if i hear any noise catherine authoritatively turning on her way to the door oh no dear you must keep them fastened you would be sure to drop off to sleep and leave them open make them fast louka louka yes madam she fastens them raina dont be anxious about me the moment i hear a shot i shall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my ears well covered catherine quite the wisest thing you can do my love goodnight raina goodnight they kiss one another and rainas emotion comes back for a moment wish me joy of the happiest night of my lifeif only there are no fugitives catherine go to bed dear and dont think of them she goes out louka secretly to raina if you would like the shutters open just give them a push like this she pushes them they open she pulls them to again one of them ought to be bolted at the bottom but the bolts gone raina with dignity reproving her thanks louka but we must do what we are told louka makes a grimace goodnight louka carelessly goodnight she goes out swaggering raina left alone goes to the chest of drawers and adores the portrait there with feelings that are beyond all expression she does not kiss it or press it to her breast or shew it any mark of bodily affection but she takes it in her hands and elevates it like a priestess raina looking up at the picture with worship oh i shall never be unworthy of you any more my heronever never never she replaces it reverently and selects a novel from the little pile of books she turns over the leaves dreamily finds her page turns the book inside out at it and then with a happy sigh gets into bed and prepares to read herself to sleep but before abandoning herself to fiction she raises her eyes once more thinking of the blessed reality and murmurs my hero my hero a distant shot breaks the quiet of the night outside she starts listening and two more shots much nearer follow startling her so that she scrambles out of bed and hastily blows out the candle on the chest of drawers then putting her fingers in her ears she runs to the dressingtable and blows out the light there and hurries back to bed the room is now in darkness nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in the pierced ball before the image and the starlight seen through the slits at the top of the shutters the firing breaks out again there is a startling fusillade quite close at hand whilst it is still echoing the shutters disappear pulled open from without and for an instant the rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the figure of a man in black upon it the shutters close immediately and the room is dark again but the silence is now broken by the sound of panting then there is a scrape and the flame of a match is seen in the middle of the room raina crouching on the bed whos there the match is out instantly whos there who is that a mans voice in the darkness subduedly but threateningly shsh dont call out or youll be shot be good and no harm will happen to you she is heard leaving her bed and making for the door take care theres no use in trying to run away remember if you raise your voice my pistol will go off commandingly strike a light and let me see you do you hear another moment of silence and darkness then she is heard retreating to the dressingtable she lights a candle and the mystery is at an end a man of about 35 in a deplorable plight bespattered with mud and blood and snow his belt and the strap of his revolver case keeping together the torn ruins of the blue coat of a servian artillery officer as far as the candlelight and his unwashed unkempt condition make it possible to judge he is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance with strong neck and shoulders a roundish obstinate looking head covered with short crisp bronze curls clear quick blue eyes and good brows and mouth a hopelessly prosaic nose like that of a strongminded baby trim soldierlike carriage and energetic manner and with all his wits about him in spite of his desperate predicamenteven with a sense of humor of it without however the least intention of trifling with it or throwing away a chance he reckons up what he can guess about rainaher age her social position her character the extent to which she is frightenedat a glance and continues more politely but still most determinedly excuse my disturbing you but you recognise my uniformservian if im caught i shall be killed determinedly do you understand that raina yes man well i dont intend to get killed if i can help it still more determinedly do you understand that he locks the door with a snap raina disdainfully i suppose not she draws herself up superbly and looks him straight in the face saying with emphasis some soldiers i know are afraid of death man with grim goodhumor all of them dear lady all of them believe me it is our duty to live as long as we can and kill as many of the enemy as we can now if you raise an alarm raina cutting him short you will shoot me how do you know that i am afraid to die man cunningly ah but suppose i dont shoot you what will happen then why a lot of your cavalrythe greatest blackguards in your armywill burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig for ill fight like a demon they shant get me into the street to amuse themselves with i know what they are are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress raina suddenly conscious of her nightgown instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her he watches her and adds pitilessly its rather scanty eh she turns to the ottoman he raises his pistol instantly and cries stop she stops where are you going raina with dignified patience only to get my cloak man darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak a good idea no ill keep the cloak and you will take care that nobody comes in and sees you without it this is a better weapon than the pistol he throws the pistol down on the ottoman raina revolted it is not the weapon of a gentleman man its good enough for a man with only you to stand between him and death as they look at one another for a moment raina hardly able to believe that even a servian officer can be so cynically and selfishly unchivalrous they are startled by a sharp fusillade in the street the chill of imminent death hushes the mans voice as he adds do you hear if you are going to bring those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you are raina meets his eye with unflinching scorn suddenly he starts listening there is a step outside someone tries the door and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it raina looks at the man breathless he throws up his head with the gesture of a man who sees that it is all over with him and dropping the manner which he has been assuming to intimidate her flings the cloak to her exclaiming sincerely and kindly no use im done for quick wrap yourself up theyre coming raina catching the cloak eagerly oh thank you she wraps herself up with great relief he draws his sabre and turns to the door waiting louka outside knocking my lady my lady get up quick and open the door raina anxiously what will you do man grimly never mind keep out of the way it will not last long raina impulsively ill help you hide yourself oh hide yourself quick behind the curtain she seizes him by a torn strip of his sleeve and pulls him towards the window man yielding to her there is just half a chance if you keep your head remember nine soldiers out of ten are born fools he hides behind the curtain looking out for a moment to say finally if they find me i promise you a fighta devil of a fight he disappears raina takes off the cloak and throws it across the foot of the bed then with a sleepy disturbed air she opens the door louka enters excitedly louka a man has been seen climbing up the waterpipe to your balconya servian the soldiers want to search for him and they are so wild and drunk and furious my lady says you are to dress at once raina as if annoyed at being disturbed they shall not search here why have they been let in catherine coming in hastily raina darling are you safe have you seen anyone or heard anything raina i heard the shooting surely the soldiers will not dare come in here catherine i have found a russian officer thank heaven he knows sergius speaking through the door to someone outside sir will you come in now my daughter is ready a young russian officer in bulgarian uniform enters sword in hand the officer with soft feline politeness and stiff military carriage good evening gracious lady i am sorry to intrude but there is a fugitive hiding on the balcony will you and the gracious lady your mother please to withdraw whilst we search raina petulantly nonsense sir you can see that there is no one on the balcony she throws the shutters wide open and stands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden pointing to the moonlit balcony a couple of shots are fired right under the window and a bullet shatters the glass opposite raina who winks and gasps but stands her ground whilst catherine screams and the officer rushes to the balcony the officer on the balcony shouting savagely down to the street cease firing there you fools do you hear cease firing damn you he glares down for a moment then turns to raina trying to resume his polite manner could anyone have got in without your knowledge were you asleep raina no i have not been to bed the officer impatiently coming back into the room your neighbours have their heads so full of runaway servians that they see them everywhere politely gracious lady a thousand pardons goodnight military bow which raina returns coldly another to catherine who follows him out raina closes the shutters she turns and sees louka who has been watching the scene curiously raina dont leave my mother louka whilst the soldiers are here louka glances at raina at the ottoman at the curtain then purses her lips secretively laughs to herself and goes out raina follows her to the door shuts it behind her with a slam and locks it violently the man immediately steps out from behind the curtain sheathing his sabre and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way man a narrow shave but a miss is as good as a mile dear young lady your servant until death i wish for your sake i had joined the bulgarian army instead of the servian i am not a native servian raina haughtily no you are one of the austrians who set the servians on to rob us of our national liberty and who officer their army for them we hate them man austrian not i dont hate me dear young lady i am only a swiss fighting merely as a professional soldier i joined servia because it was nearest to me be generous youve beaten us hollow raina have i not been generous man nobleheroic but im not saved yet this particular rush will soon pass through but the pursuit will go on all night by fits and starts i must take my chance to get off during a quiet interval you dont mind my waiting just a minute or two do you raina oh no i am sorry you will have to go into danger again motioning towards ottoman wont you sitshe breaks off with an irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the pistol the man all nerves shies like a frightened horse man irritably dont frighten me like that what is it raina your pistol it was staring that officer in the face all the time what an escape man vexed at being unnecessarily terrified oh is that all raina staring at him rather superciliously conceiving a poorer and poorer opinion of him and feeling proportionately more and more at her ease with him i am sorry i frightened you she takes up the pistol and hands it to him pray take it to protect yourself against me man grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol no use dear young lady theres nothing in it its not loaded he makes a grimace at it and drops it disparagingly into his revolver case raina load it by all means man ive no ammunition what use are cartridges in battle i always carry chocolate instead and i finished the last cake of that yesterday raina outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood chocolate do you stuff your pockets with sweetslike a schoolboyeven in the field man yes isnt it contemptible raina stares at him unable to utter her feelings then she sails away scornfully to the chest of drawers and returns with the box of confectionery in her hand raina allow me i am sorry i have eaten them all except these she offers him the box man ravenously youre an angel he gobbles the comfits creams delicious he looks anxiously to see whether there are any more there are none he accepts the inevitable with pathetic goodhumor and says with grateful emotion bless you dear lady you can always tell an old soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes the young ones carry pistols and cartridges the old ones grub thank you he hands back the box she snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it away this impatient action is so sudden that he shies again ugh dont do things so suddenly gracious lady dont revenge yourself because i frightened you just now raina superbly frighten me do you know sir that though i am only a woman i think i am at heart as brave as you man i should think so you havent been under fire for three days as i have i can stand two days without shewing it much but no man can stand three days im as nervous as a mouse he sits down on the ottoman and takes his head in his hands would you like to see me cry raina quickly no man if you would all you have to do is to scold me just as if i were a little boy and you my nurse if i were in camp now theyd play all sorts of tricks on me raina a little moved im sorry i wont scold you touched by the sympathy in her tone he raises his head and looks gratefully at her she immediately draws back and says stiffly you must excuse me our soldiers are not like that she moves away from the ottoman man oh yes they are there are only two sorts of soldiers old ones and young ones ive served fourteen years half of your fellows never smelt powder before why how is it that youve just beaten us sheer ignorance of the art of war nothing else indignantly i never saw anything so unprofessional raina ironically oh was it unprofessional to beat you man well come is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw it raina eagerly turning to him as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her did you see the great cavalry charge oh tell me about it describe it to me man you never saw a cavalry charge did you raina how could i man ah perhaps notof course well its a funny sight its like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane first one comes then two or three close behind him and then all the rest in a lump raina her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically yes first onethe bravest of the brave man prosaically hm you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse raina why should he pull at his horse man impatient of so stupid a question its running away with him of course do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed then they all come you can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing the old ones come bunched up under the number one guard they know that they are mere projectiles and that its no use trying to fight the wounds are mostly broken knees from the horses cannoning together raina ugh but i dont believe the first man is a coward i believe he is a hero man goodhumoredly thats what youd have said if youd seen the first man in the charge today raina breathless ah i knew it tell metell me about him man he did it like an operatic tenora regular handsome fellow with flashing eyes and lovely moustache shouting a warcry and charging like don quixote at the windmills we nearly burst with laughter at him but when the sergeant ran up as white as a sheet and told us theyd sent us the wrong cartridges and that we couldnt fire a shot for the next ten minutes we laughed at the other side of our mouths i never felt so sick in my life though ive been in one or two very tight places and i hadnt even a revolver cartridgenothing but chocolate wed no bayonetsnothing of course they just cut us to bits and there was don quixote flourishing like a drum major thinking hed done the cleverest thing ever known whereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it of all the fools ever let loose on a field of battle that man must be the very maddest he and his regiment simply committed suicideonly the pistol missed fire thats all raina deeply wounded but steadfastly loyal to her ideals indeed would you know him again if you saw him man shall i ever forget him she again goes to the chest of drawers he watches her with a vague hope that she may have something else for him to eat she takes the portrait from its stand and brings it to him raina that is a photograph of the gentlemanthe patriot and heroto whom i am betrothed man looking at it im really very sorry looking at her was it fair to lead me on he looks at the portrait again yes thats him not a doubt of it he stifles a laugh raina quickly why do you laugh man shamefacedly but still greatly tickled i didnt laugh i assure you at least i didnt mean to but when i think of him charging the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest thingchokes with suppressed laughter raina sternly give me back the portrait sir man with sincere remorse of course certainly im really very sorry she deliberately kisses it and looks him straight in the face before returning to the chest of drawers to replace it he follows her apologizing perhaps im quite wrong you know no doubt i am most likely he had got wind of the cartridge business somehow and knew it was a safe job raina that is to say he was a pretender and a coward you did not dare say that before man with a comic gesture of despair its no use dear lady i cant make you see it from the professional point of view as he turns away to get back to the ottoman the firing begins again in the distance raina sternly as she sees him listening to the shots so much the better for you man turning how raina you are my enemy and you are at my mercy what would i do if i were a professional soldier man ah true dear young lady youre always right i know how good you have been to me to my last hour i shall remember those three chocolate creams it was unsoldierly but it was angelic raina coldly thank you and now i will do a soldierly thing you cannot stay here after what you have just said about my future husband but i will go out on the balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the street she turns to the window man changing countenance down that waterpipe stop wait i cant i darent the very thought of it makes me giddy i came up it fast enough with death behind me but to face it now in cold bloodhe sinks on the ottoman its no use i give up im beaten give the alarm he drops his head in his hands in the deepest dejection raina disarmed by pity come dont be disheartened she stoops over him almost maternally he shakes his head oh you are a very poor soldiera chocolate cream soldier come cheer up it takes less courage to climb down than to face captureremember that man dreamily lulled by her voice no capture only means death and death is sleepoh sleep sleep sleep undisturbed sleep climbing down the pipe means doing somethingexerting myselfthinking death ten times over first raina softly and wonderingly catching the rhythm of his weariness are you so sleepy as that man ive not had two hours undisturbed sleep since the war began im on the staff you dont know what that means i havent closed my eyes for thirtysix hours raina desperately but what am i to do with you man staggering up of course i must do something he shakes himself pulls himself together and speaks with rallied vigour and courage you see sleep or no sleep hunger or no hunger tired or not tired you can always do a thing when you know it must be done well that pipe must be got downhe hits himself on the chest and addsdo you hear that you chocolate cream soldier he turns to the window raina anxiously but if you fall man i shall sleep as if the stones were a feather bed goodbye he makes boldly for the window and his hand is on the shutter when there is a terrible burst of firing in the street beneath raina rushing to him stop she catches him by the shoulder and turns him quite round theyll kill you man coolly but attentively never mind this sort of thing is all in my days work im bound to take my chance decisively now do what i tell you put out the candles so that they shant see the light when i open the shutters and keep away from the window whatever you do if they see me theyre sure to have a shot at me raina clinging to him theyre sure to see you its bright moonlight ill save youoh how can you be so indifferent you want me to save you dont you man i really dont want to be troublesome she shakes him in her impatience i am not indifferent dear young lady i assure you but how is it to be done raina come away from the windowplease she coaxes him back to the middle of the room he submits humbly she releases him and addresses him patronizingly now listen you must trust to our hospitality you do not yet know in whose house you are i am a petkoff man whats that raina rather indignantly i mean that i belong to the family of the petkoffs the richest and best known in our country man oh yes of course i beg your pardon the petkoffs to be sure how stupid of me raina you know you never heard of them until this minute how can you stoop to pretend man forgive me im too tired to think and the change of subject was too much for me dont scold me raina i forgot it might make you cry he nods quite seriously she pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone i must tell you that my father holds the highest command of any bulgarian in our army he is proudly a major man pretending to be deeply impressed a major bless me think of that raina you shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was necessary to climb up to the balcony because ours is the only private house that has two rows of windows there is a flight of stairs inside to get up and down by man stairs how grand you live in great luxury indeed dear young lady raina do you know what a library is man a library a roomful of books raina yes we have one the only one in bulgaria man actually a real library i should like to see that raina affectedly i tell you these things to shew you that you are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your servian uniform but among civilized people we go to bucharest every year for the opera season and i have spent a whole month in vienna man i saw that dear young lady i saw at once that you knew the world raina have you ever seen the opera of ernani man is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet and a soldiers chorus raina contemptuously no man stifling a heavy sigh of weariness then i dont know it raina i thought you might have remembered the great scene where ernani flying from his foes just as you are tonight takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy an old castilian noble the noble refuses to give him up his guest is sacred to him man quickly waking up a little have your people got that notion raina with dignity my mother and i can understand that notion as you call it and if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our

by raina raina looking at the ottoman hes gone i left him here catherine here then he must have climbed down from the raina seeing him oh she points catherine scandalized well she strides to the left

sir raina catching her arm dont mamma the poor dear is worn out let him sleep catherine letting him go and turning amazed to raina the poor dear raina she looks sternly at her daughter the man sleeps profoundly act ii the sixth of march 1886 in the garden of major petkoffs house it is a fine spring morning and the garden looks fresh and pretty beyond the paling the tops of a couple of minarets can be seen shewing that there is a valley there with the little town in it a few miles further the balkan mountains rise and shut in the view within the garden the side of the house is seen on the right with a garden door reached by a little flight of steps on the left the stable yard with its gateway encroaches on the garden there are fruit bushes along the paling and house covered with washing hung out to dry a path runs by the house and rises by two steps at the corner where it turns out of the right along the front in the middle a small table with two bent wood chairs at it is laid for breakfast with turkish coffee pot cups rolls etc but the cups have been used and the bread broken there is a wooden garden seat against the wall on the left louka smoking a cigaret is standing between the table and the house turning her back with angry disdain on a manservant who is lecturing her he is a middleaged man of cool temperament and low but clear and keen intelligence with the complacency of the servant who values himself on his rank in servility and the imperturbability of the accurate calculator who has no illusions he wears a white bulgarian costume jacket with decorated border sash wide knickerbockers and decorated gaiters his head is shaved up to the crown giving him a high japanese forehead his name is nicola nicola be warned in time louka mend your manners i know the mistress she is so grand that she never dreams that any servant could dare to be disrespectful to her but if she once suspects that you are defying her out you go louka i do defy her i will defy her what do i care for her nicola if you quarrel with the family i never can marry you its the same as if you quarrelled with me louka you take her part against me do you nicola sedately i shall always be dependent on the good will of the family when i leave their service and start a shop in sofia their custom will be half my capital their bad word would ruin me louka you have no spirit i should like to see them dare say a word against me nicola pityingly i should have expected more sense from you louka but youre young youre young louka yes and you like me the better for it dont you but i know some family secrets they wouldnt care to have told young as i am let them quarrel with me if they dare nicola with compassionate superiority do you know what they would do if they heard you talk like that louka what could they do nicola discharge you for untruthfulness who would believe any stories you told after that who would give you another situation who in this house would dare be seen speaking to you ever again how long would your father be left on his little farm she impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret and stamps on it child you dont know the power such high people have over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our poverty against them he goes close to her and lowers his voice look at me ten years in their service do you think i know no secrets i know things about the mistress that she wouldnt have the master know for a thousand levas i know things about him that she wouldnt let him hear the last of for six months if i blabbed them to her i know things about raina that would break off her match with sergius if louka turning on him quickly how do you know i never told you nicola opening his eyes cunningly so thats your little secret is it i thought it might be something like that well you take my advice and be respectful and make the mistress feel that no matter what you know or dont know they can depend on you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully thats what they like and thats how youll make most out of them louka with searching scorn you have the soul of a servant nicola nicola complacently yes thats the secret of success in service a loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden door outside on the left is heard male voice outside hollo hollo there nicola louka master back from the war nicola quickly my word for it louka the wars over off with you and get some fresh coffee he runs out into the stable yard louka as she puts the coffee pot and the cups upon the tray and carries it into the house youll never put the soul of a servant into me major petkoff comes from the stable yard followed by nicola he is a cheerful excitable insignificant unpolished man of about 50 naturally unambitious except as to his income and his importance in local society but just now greatly pleased with the military rank which the war has thrust on him as a man of consequence in his town the fever of plucky patriotism which the servian attack roused in all the bulgarians has pulled him through the war but he is obviously glad to be home again petkoff pointing to the table with his whip breakfast out here eh nicola yes sir the mistress and miss raina have just gone in petkoff fitting down and taking a roll go in and say ive come and get me some fresh coffee nicola its coming sir he goes to the house door louka with fresh coffee a clean cup and a brandy bottle on her tray meets him have you told the mistress louka yes shes coming nicola goes into the house louka brings the coffee to the table petkoff well the servians havent run away with you have they louka no sir petkoff thats right have you brought me some cognac louka putting the bottle on the table here sir petkoff thats right he pours some into his coffee catherine who has at this early hour made only a very perfunctory toilet and wears a bulgarian apron over a once brilliant but now half worn out red dressing gown and a colored handkerchief tied over her thick black hair with turkish slippers on her bare feet comes from the house looking astonishingly handsome and stately under all the circumstances louka goes into the house catherine my dear paul what a surprise for us she stoops over the back of his chair to kiss him have they brought you fresh coffee petkoff yes loukas been looking after me the wars over the treaty was signed three days ago at bucharest and the decree for our army to demobilize was issued yesterday catherine springing erect with flashing eyes the war over paul have you let the austrians force you to make peace petkoff submissively my dear they didnt consult me what could _i_ do she sits down and turns away from him but of course we saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one it declares peace catherine outraged peace petkoff appeasing herbut not friendly relations remember that they wanted to put that in but i insisted on its being struck out what more could i do catherine you could have annexed servia and made prince alexander emperor of the balkans thats what i would have done petkoff i dont doubt it in the least my dear but i should have had to subdue the whole austrian empire first and that would have kept me too long away from you i missed you greatly catherine relenting ah stretches her hand affectionately across the table to squeeze his petkoff and how have you been my dear catherine oh my usual sore throats thats all petkoff with conviction that comes from washing your neck every day ive often told you so catherine nonsense paul petkoff over his coffee and cigaret i dont believe in going too far with these modern customs all this washing cant be good for the health its not natural there was an englishman at phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold water every morning when he got up disgusting it all comes from the english their climate makes them so dirty that they have to be perpetually washing themselves look at my father he never had a bath in his life and he lived to be ninetyeight the healthiest man in bulgaria i dont mind a good wash once a week to keep up my position but once a day is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme catherine you are a barbarian at heart still paul i hope you behaved yourself before all those russian officers petkoff i did my best i took care to let them know that we had a library catherine ah but you didnt tell them that we have an electric bell in it i have had one put up petkoff whats an electric bell catherine you touch a button something tinkles in the kitchen and then nicola comes up petkoff why not shout for him catherine civilized people never shout for their servants ive learnt that while you were away petkoff well ill tell you something ive learnt too civilized people dont hang out their washing to dry where visitors can see it so youd better have all that indicating the clothes on the bushes put somewhere else catherine oh thats absurd paul i dont believe really refined people notice such things someone is heard knocking at the stable gates petkoff theres sergius shouting hollo nicola catherine oh dont shout paul it really isnt nice petkoff bosh he shouts louder than before nicola nicola appearing at the house door yes sir petkoff if that is major saranoff bring him round this way he pronounces the name with the stress on the second syllablesarahnoff nicola yes sir he goes into the stable yard petkoff you must talk to him my dear until raina takes him off our hands he bores my life out about our not promoting himover my head mind you catherine he certainly ought to be promoted when he marries raina besides the country should insist on having at least one native general petkoff yes so that he could throw away whole brigades instead of regiments its no use my dear he has not the slightest chance of promotion until we are quite sure that the peace will be a lasting one nicola at the gate announcing major sergius saranoff he goes into the house and returns presently with a third chair which he places at the table he then withdraws major sergius saranoff the original of the portrait in rainas room is a tall romantically handsome man with the physical hardihood the high spirit and the susceptible imagination of an untamed mountaineer chieftain but his remarkable personal distinction is of a characteristically civilized type the ridges of his eyebrows curving with a ramshorn twist round the marked projections at the outer corners his jealously observant eye his nose thin keen and apprehensive in spite of the pugnacious high bridge and large nostril his assertive chin would not be out of place in a paris salon in short the clever imaginative barbarian has an acute critical faculty which has been thrown into intense activity by the arrival of western civilization in the balkans and the result is precisely what the advent of nineteenthcentury thought first produced in england towit byronism by his brooding on the perpetual failure not only of others but of himself to live up to his imaginative ideals his consequent cynical scorn for humanity the jejune credulity as to the absolute validity of his ideals and the unworthiness of the world in disregarding them his wincings and mockeries under the sting of the petty disillusions which every hour spent among men brings to his infallibly quick observation he has acquired the half tragic half ironic air the mysterious moodiness the suggestion of a strange and terrible history that has left him nothing but undying remorse by which childe harold fascinated the grandmothers of his english contemporaries altogether it is clear that here or nowhere is rainas ideal hero catherine is hardly less enthusiastic and much less reserved in shewing her enthusiasm as he enters from the stable gate she rises effusively to greet him petkoff is distinctly less disposed to make a fuss about him petkoff here already sergius glad to see you catherine my dear sergiusshe holds out both her hands sergius kissing them with scrupulous gallantry my dear mother if i may call you so petkoff drily motherinlaw sergius motherinlaw sit down and have some coffee sergius thank you none for me he gets away from the table with a certain distaste for petkoffs enjoyment of it and posts himself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps leading to the house catherine you look superbsplendid the campaign has improved you everybody here is mad about you we were all wild with enthusiasm about that magnificent cavalry charge sergius with grave irony madam it was the cradle and the grave of my military reputation catherine how so sergius i won the battle the wrong way when our worthy russian generals were losing it the right way that upset their plans and wounded their selfesteem two of their colonels got their regiments driven back on the correct principles of scientific warfare two majorgenerals got killed strictly according to military etiquette those two colonels are now majorgenerals and i am still a simple major catherine you shall not remain so sergius the women are on your side and they will see that justice is done you sergius it is too late i have only waited for the peace to send in my resignation petkoff dropping his cup in his amazement your resignation catherine oh you must withdraw it sergius with resolute measured emphasis folding his arms i never withdraw petkoff vexed now who could have supposed you were going to do such a thing sergius with fire everyone that knew me but enough of myself and my affairs how is raina and where is raina raina suddenly coming round the corner of the house and standing at the top of the steps in the path raina is here she makes a charming picture as they all turn to look at her she wears an underdress of pale green silk draped with an overdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold on her head she wears a pretty phrygian cap of gold tinsel sergius with an exclamation of pleasure goes impulsively to meet her she stretches out her hand he drops chivalrously on one knee and kisses it petkoff aside to catherine beaming with parental pride pretty isnt it she always appears at the right moment catherine impatiently yes she listens for it it is an abominable habit sergius leads raina forward with splendid gallantry as if she were a queen when they come to the table she turns to him with a bend of the head he bows and thus they separate he coming to his place and she going behind her fathers chair raina stooping and kissing her father dear father welcome home petkoff patting her cheek my little pet girl he kisses her she goes to the chair left by nicola for sergius and sits down catherine and so youre no longer a soldier sergius sergius i am no longer a soldier soldiering my dear madam is the cowards art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong and keeping out of harms way when you are weak that is the whole secret of successful fighting get your enemy at a disadvantage and never on any account fight him on equal terms eh major petkoff they wouldnt let us make a fair standup fight of it however i suppose soldiering has to be a trade like any other trade sergius precisely but i have no ambition to succeed as a tradesman so i have taken the advice of that bagman of a captain that settled the exchange of prisoners with us at peerot and given it up petkoff what that swiss fellow sergius ive often thought of that exchange since he overreached us about those horses sergius of course he overreached us his father was a hotel and livery stable keeper and he owed his first step to his knowledge of horsedealing with mock enthusiasm ah he was a soldierevery inch a soldier if only i had bought the horses for my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger i should have been a fieldmarshal now catherine a swiss what was he doing in the servian army petkoff a volunteer of coursekeen on picking up his profession chuckling we shouldnt have been able to begin fighting if these foreigners hadnt shewn us how to do it we knew nothing about it and neither did the servians egad thered have been no war without them raina are there many swiss officers in the servian army petkoff noall austrians just as our officers were all russians this was the only swiss i came across ill never trust a swiss again he cheated ushumbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out chargers they werent even eatable sergius we were two children in the hands of that consummate soldier major simply two innocent little children raina what was he like catherine oh raina what a silly question sergius he was like a commercial traveller in uniform bourgeois to his boots petkoff grinning sergius tell catherine that queer story his friend told us about himhow he escaped after slivnitza you rememberabout his being hid by two women sergius with bitter irony oh yes quite a romance he was serving in the very battery i so unprofessionally charged being a thorough soldier he ran away like the rest of them with our cavalry at his heels to escape their attentions he had the good taste to take refuge in the chamber of some patriotic young bulgarian lady the young lady was enchanted by his persuasive commercial travellers manners she very modestly entertained him for an hour or so and then called in her mother lest her conduct should appear unmaidenly the old lady was equally fascinated and the fugitive was sent on his way in the morning disguised in an old coat belonging to the master of the house who was away at the war raina rising with marked stateliness your life in the camp has made you coarse sergius i did not think you would have repeated such a story before me she turns away coldly catherine also rising she is right sergius if such women exist we should be spared the knowledge of them petkoff pooh nonsense what does it matter sergius ashamed no petkoff i was wrong to raina with earnest humility i beg your pardon i have behaved abominably forgive me raina she bows reservedly and you too madam catherine bows graciously and sits down he proceeds solemnly again addressing raina the glimpses i have had of the seamy side of life during the last few months have made me cynical but i should not have brought my cynicism hereleast of all into your presence raina ihere turning to the others he is evidently about to begin a long speech when the major interrupts him petkoff stuff and nonsense sergius thats quite enough fuss about nothing a soldiers daughter should be able to stand up without flinching to a little strong conversation he rises come its time for us to get to business we have to make up our minds how those three regiments are to get back to phillipopolistheres no forage for them on the sofia route he goes towards the house come along sergius is about to follow him when catherine rises and intervenes catherine oh paul cant you spare sergius for a few moments raina has hardly seen him yet perhaps i can help you to settle about the regiments sergius protesting my dear madam impossible you catherine stopping him playfully you stay here my dear sergius theres no hurry i have a word or two to say to paul sergius instantly bows and steps back now dear taking petkoffs arm come and see the electric bell petkoff oh very well very well they go into the house together affectionately sergius left alone with raina looks anxiously at her fearing that she may be still offended she smiles and stretches out her arms to him exit r into house followed by catherine sergius hastening to her but refraining from touching her without express permission am i forgiven raina placing her hands on his shoulder as she looks up at him with admiration and worship my hero my king sergius my queen he kisses her on the forehead with holy awe raina how i have envied you sergius you have been out in the world on the field of battle able to prove yourself there worthy of any woman in the world whilst i have had to sit at home inactivedreaminguselessdoing nothing that could give me the right to call myself worthy of any man sergius dearest all my deeds have been yours you inspired me i have gone through the war like a knight in a tournament with his lady looking on at him raina and you have never been absent from my thoughts for a moment very solemnly sergius i think we two have found the higher love when i think of you i feel that i could never do a base deed or think an ignoble thought sergius my lady and my saint clasping her reverently raina returning his embrace my lord and my g sergius shsh let me be the worshipper dear you little know how unworthy even the best man is of a girls pure passion raina i trust you i love you you will never disappoint me sergius louka is heard singing within the house they quickly release each other hush i cant pretend to talk indifferently before her my heart is too full louka comes from the house with her tray she goes to the table and begins to clear it with her back turned to them i will go and get my hat and then we can go out until lunch time wouldnt you like that sergius be quick if you are away five minutes it will seem five hours raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands he looks after her with emotion for a moment then turns slowly away his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which has just passed the movement shifts his field of vision into the corner of which there now comes the tail of loukas double apron his eye gleams at once he takes a stealthy look at her and begins to twirl his moustache nervously with his left hand akimbo on his hip finally striking the ground with his heels in something of a cavalry swagger he strolls over to the left of the table opposite her and says louka do you know what the higher love is louka astonished no sir sergius very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time louka one feels the need of some relief after it louka innocently perhaps you would like some coffee sir she stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot sergius taking her hand thank you louka louka pretending to pull oh sir you know i didnt mean that im surprised at you sergius coming clear of the table and drawing her with him i am surprised at myself louka what would sergius the hero of slivnitza say if he saw me now what would sergius the apostle of the higher love say if he saw me now what would the half dozen sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome figure of mine say if they caught us here letting go her hand and slipping his arm dexterously round her waist do you consider my figure handsome louka louka let me go sir i shall be disgraced she struggles he holds her inexorably oh will you let go sergius looking straight into her eyes no louka then stand back where we cant be seen have you no common sense sergius ah thats reasonable he takes her into the stableyard gateway where they are hidden from the house louka complaining i may have been seen from the windows miss raina is sure to be spying about after you sergius stungletting her go take care louka i may be worthless enough to betray the higher love but do not you insult it louka demurely not for the world sir im sure may i go on with my work please now sergius again putting his arm round her you are a provoking little witch louka if you were in love with me would you spy out of windows on me louka well you see sir since you say you are half a dozen different gentlemen all at once i should have a great deal to look after sergius charmed witty as well as pretty he tries to kiss her louka avoiding him no i dont want your kisses gentlefolk are all alikeyou making love to me behind miss rainas back and she doing the same behind yours sergius recoiling a step louka louka it shews how little you really care sergius dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness if our conversation is to continue louka you will please remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid louka its so hard to know what a gentleman considers right i thought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular sergius turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden from the gateway devil devil louka ha ha i expect one of the six of you is very like me sir though i am only miss rainas maid she goes back to her work at the table taking no further notice of him sergius speaking to himself which of the six is the real manthats the question that torments me one of them is a hero another a buffoon another a humbug another perhaps a bit of a blackguard he pauses and looks furtively at louka as he adds with deep bitterness and one at least is a cowardjealous like all cowards he goes to the table louka louka yes sergius who is my rival louka you shall never get that out of me for love or money sergius why louka never mind why besides you would tell that i told you and i should lose my place sergius holding out his right hand in affirmation no on the honor of ahe checks himself and his hand drops nerveless as he concludes sardonicallyof a man capable of behaving as i have been behaving for the last five minutes who is he louka i dont know i never saw him i only heard his voice through the door of her room sergius damnation how dare you louka retreating oh i mean no harm youve no right to take up my words like that the mistress knows all about it and i tell you that if that gentleman ever comes here again miss raina will marry him whether he likes it or not i know the difference between the sort of manner you and she put on before one another and the real manner sergius shivers as if she had stabbed him then setting his face like iron he strides grimly to her and grips her above the elbows with both bands sergius now listen you to me louka wincing not so tight youre hurting me sergius that doesnt matter you have stained my honor by making me a party to your eavesdropping and you have betrayed your mistress louka writhing please sergius that shews that you are an abominable little clod of common clay with the soul of a servant he lets her go as if she were an unclean thing and turns away dusting his hands of her to the bench by the wall where he sits down with averted head meditating gloomily louka whimpering angrily with her hands up her sleeves feeling her bruised arms you know how to hurt with your tongue as well as with your hands but i dont care now ive found out that whatever clay im made of youre made of the same as for her shes a liar and her fine airs are a cheat and im worth six of her she shakes the pain off hardily tosses her head and sets to work to put the things on the tray he looks doubtfully at her once or twice she finishes packing the tray and laps the cloth over the edges so as to carry all out together as she stoops to lift it he rises sergius louka she stops and looks defiantly at him with the tray in her hands a gentleman has no right to hurt a woman under any circumstances with profound humility uncovering his head i beg your pardon louka that sort of apology may satisfy a lady of what use is it to a servant sergius thus rudely crossed in his chivalry throws it off with a bitter laugh and says slightingly oh you wish to be paid for the hurt he puts on his shako and takes some money from his pocket louka her eyes filling with tears in spite of herself no i want my hurt made well sergius sobered by her tone how she rolls up her left sleeve clasps her arm with the thumb and fingers of her right hand and looks down at the bruise then she raises her head and looks straight at him finally with a superb gesture she presents her arm to be kissed amazed he looks at her at the arm at her again hesitates and then with shuddering intensity exclaims sergius never and gets away as far as possible from her her arm drops without a word and with unaffected dignity she takes her tray and is approaching the house when raina returns wearing a hat and jacket in the height of the vienna fashion of the previous year 1885 louka makes way proudly for her and then goes into the house raina im ready whats the matter gaily have you been flirting with louka sergius hastily no no how can you think such a thing raina ashamed of herself forgive me dear it was only a jest i am so happy today he goes quickly to her and kisses her hand remorsefully catherine comes out and calls to them from the top of the steps catherine coming down to them i am sorry to disturb you children but paul is distracted over those three regiments he does not know how to get them to phillipopolis and he objects to every suggestion of mine you must go and help him sergius he is in the library raina disappointed but we are just going out for a walk sergius i shall not be long wait for me just five minutes he runs up the steps to the door raina following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at him with timid coquetry i shall go round and wait in full view of the library windows be sure you draw fathers attention to me if you are a moment longer than five minutes i shall go in and fetch you regiments or no regiments sergius laughing very well he goes in raina watches him until he is out of her sight then with a perceptible relaxation of manner she begins to pace up and down about the garden in a brown study catherine imagine their meeting that swiss and hearing the whole story the very first thing your father asked for was the old coat we sent him off in a nice mess you have got us into raina gazing thoughtfully at the gravel as she walks the little beast catherine little beast what little beast raina to go and tell oh if i had him here id stuff him with chocolate creams till he couldnt ever speak again catherine dont talk nonsense tell me the truth raina how long was he in your room before you came to me raina whisking round and recommencing her march in the opposite direction oh i forget catherine you cannot forget did he really climb up after the soldiers were gone or was he there when that officer searched the room raina no yes i think he must have been there then catherine you think oh raina raina will anything ever make you straightforward if sergius finds out it is all over between you raina with cool impertinence oh i know sergius is your pet i sometimes wish you could marry him instead of me you would just suit him you would pet him and spoil him and mother him to perfection catherine opening her eyes very widely indeed well upon my word raina capriciouslyhalf to herself i always feel a longing to do or say something dreadful to himto shock his proprietyto scandalize the five senses out of him to catherine perversely i dont care whether he finds out about the chocolate cream soldier or not i half hope he may she again turns flippantly away and strolls up the path to the corner of the house catherine and what should i be able to say to your father pray raina over her shoulder from the top of the two steps oh poor father as if he could help himself she turns the corner and passes out of sight catherine looking after her her fingers itching oh if you were only ten years younger louka comes from the house with a salver which she carries hanging down by her side well louka theres a gentleman just called madama servian officer catherine flaming a servian how dare hechecking herself bitterly oh i forgot we are at peace now i suppose we shall have them calling every day to pay their compliments well if he is an officer why dont you tell your master he is in the library with major saranoff why do you come to me louka but he asks for you madam and i dont think he knows who you are he said the lady of the house he gave me this little ticket for you she takes a card out of her bosom puts it on the salver and offers it to catherine catherine reading captain bluntschli thats a german name louka swiss madam i think catherine with a bound that makes louka jump back swiss what is he like louka timidly he has a big carpet bag madam catherine oh heavens hes come to return the coat send him awaysay were not at homeask him to leave his address and ill write to himoh stop that will never do wait she throws herself into a chair to think it out louka waits the master and major saranoff are busy in the library arent they louka yes madam catherine decisively bring the gentleman out here at once imperatively and be very polite to him dont delay here impatiently snatching the salver from her leave that here and go straight back to him louka yes madam going catherine louka louka stopping yes madam catherine is the library door shut louka i think so madam catherine if not shut it as you pass through louka yes madam going catherine stop louka stops he will have to go out that way indicating the gate of the stable yard tell nicola to bring his bag here after him dont forget louka surprised his bag catherine yes here as soon as possible vehemently be quick louka runs into the house catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush she then takes up the salver and uses it as a mirror with the result that the handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron a touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable oh howhowhow can a man be such a fool such a moment to select louka appears at the door of the house announcing captain bluntschli and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass before she goes in again he is the man of the adventure in rainas room he is now clean well brushed smartly uniformed and out of trouble but still unmistakably the same man the moment loukas back is turned catherine swoops on him with hurried urgent coaxing appeal captain bluntschli i am very glad to see you but you must leave this house at once he raises his eyebrows my husband has just returned with my future soninlaw and they know nothing if they did the consequences would be terrible you are a foreigner you do not feel our national animosities as we do we still hate the servians the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey if he discovered our secret he would never forgive me and my daughters life would hardly be safe will you like the chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are leave at once before he finds you here bluntschli disappointed but philosophical at once gracious lady i only came to thank you and return the coat you lent me if you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with your servant as i pass out i need detain you no further he turns to go into the house catherine catching him by the sleeve oh you must not think of going back that way coaxing him across to the stable gates this is the shortest way out many thanks so glad to have been of service to you goodbye bluntschli but my bag catherine it will be sent on you will leave me your address bluntschli true allow me he takes out his cardcase and stops to write his address keeping catherine in an agony of impatience as he hands her the card petkoff hatless rushes from the house in a fluster of hospitality followed by sergius petkoff as he hurries down the steps my dear captain bluntschli catherine oh heavens she sinks on the seat against the wall petkoff too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes bluntschlis hand heartily those stupid people of mine thought i was out here instead of in thehawlibrary he cannot mention the library without betraying how proud he is of it i saw you through the window i was wondering why you didnt come in saranoff is with me you remember him dont you sergius saluting humorously and then offering his hand with great charm of manner welcome our friend the enemy petkoff no longer the enemy happily rather anxiously i hope youve come as a friend and not on business catherine oh quite as a friend paul i was just asking captain bluntschli to stay to lunch but he declares he must go at once sergius sardonically impossible bluntschli we want you here badly we have to send on three cavalry regiments to phillipopolis and we dont in the least know how to do it bluntschli suddenly attentive and businesslike phillipopolis the forage is the trouble eh petkoff eagerly yes thats it to sergius he sees the whole thing at once bluntschli i think i can shew you how to manage that sergius invaluable man come along towering over bluntschli he puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps petkoff following as bluntschli puts his foot on the first step raina comes out of the house raina completely losing her presence of mind oh the chocolate cream soldier bluntschli stands rigid sergius amazed looks at raina then at petkoff who looks back at him and then at his wife catherine with commanding presence of mind my dear raina dont you see that we have a guest herecaptain bluntschli one of our new servian friends raina bows bluntschli bows raina how silly of me she comes down into the centre of the group between bluntschli and petkoff i made a beautiful ornament this morning for the ice pudding and that stupid nicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it to bluntschli winningly i hope you didnt think that you were the chocolate cream soldier captain bluntschli bluntschli laughing i assure you i did stealing a whimsical glance at her your explanation was a relief petkoff suspiciously to raina and since when pray have you taken to cooking catherine oh whilst you were away it is her latest fancy petkoff testily and has nicola taken to drinking he used to be careful enough first he shews captain bluntschli out here when he knew quite well i was in thehumlibrary and then he goes downstairs and breaks rainas chocolate soldier he mustat this moment nicola appears at the top of the steps r with a carpet bag he descends places it respectfully before bluntschli and waits for further orders general amazement nicola unconscious of the effect he is producing looks perfectly satisfied with himself when petkoff recovers his power of speech he breaks out at him with are you mad nicola nicola taken aback sir petkoff what have you brought that for nicola my ladys orders sir louka told me that catherine interrupting him my orders why should i order you to bring captain bluntschlis luggage out here what are you thinking of nicola nicola after a moments bewilderment picking up the bag as he addresses bluntschli with the very perfection of servile discretion i beg your pardon sir i am sure to catherine my fault madam i hope youll overlook it he bows and is going to the steps with the bag when petkoff addresses him angrily petkoff youd better go and slam that bag too down on miss rainas ice pudding this is too much for nicola the bag drops from his hands on petkoffs corns eliciting a roar of anguish from him begone you butterfingered donkey nicola snatching up the bag and escaping into the house yes sir catherine oh never mind paul dont be angry petkoff muttering scoundrel hes got out of hand while i was away ill teach him recollecting his guest oh well never mind come bluntschli lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away you know very well youre not going back to switzerland yet until you do go back youll stay with us raina oh do captain bluntschli petkoff to catherine now catherine its of you that hes afraid press him and hell stay catherine of course i shall be only too delighted if appealingly captain bluntschli really wishes to stay he knows my wishes bluntschli in his driest military manner i am at madames orders sergius cordially that settles it petkoff heartily of course raina you see you must stay bluntschli smiling well if i must i must gesture of despair from catherine act iii in the library after lunch it is not much of a library its literary equipment consisting of a single fixed shelf stocked with old papercovered novels broken backed coffee stained torn and thumbed and a couple of little hanging shelves with a few gift books on them the rest of the wall space being occupied by trophies of war and the chase but it is a most comfortable sittingroom a row of three large windows in the front of the house shew a mountain panorama which is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in the mellowing afternoon light in the left hand corner a square earthenware stove a perfect tower of colored pottery rises nearly to the ceiling and guarantees plenty of warmth the ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of decorated cushions and the window seats are well upholstered divans little turkish tables one of them with an elaborate hookah on it and a screen to match them complete the handsome effect of the furnishing there is one object however which is hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings this is a small kitchen table much the worse for wear fitted as a writing table with an old canister full of pens an eggcup filled with ink and a deplorable scrap of severely used pink blotting paper at the side of this table which stands on the right bluntschli is hard at work with a couple of maps before him writing orders at the head of it sits sergius who is also supposed to be at work but who is actually gnawing the feather of a pen and contemplating bluntschlis quick sure businesslike progress with a mixture of envious irritation at his own incapacity and awestruck wonder at an ability which seems to him almost miraculous though its prosaic character forbids him to esteem it the major is comfortably established on the ottoman with a newspaper in his hand and the tube of the hookah within his reach catherine sits at the stove with her back to them embroidering raina reclining on the divan under the left hand window is gazing in a daydream out at the balkan landscape with a neglected novel in her lap the door is on the left the button of the electric bell is between the door and the fireplace petkoff looking up from his paper to watch how they are getting on at the table are you sure i cant help you in any way bluntschli bluntschli without interrupting his writing or looking up quite sure thank you saranoff and i will manage it sergius grimly yes well manage it he finds out what to do draws up the orders and i sign em division of labour major bluntschli passes him a paper another one thank you he plants the papers squarely before him sets his chair carefully parallel to them and signs with the air of a man resolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat this hand is more accustomed to the sword than to the pen petkoff its very good of you bluntschli it is indeed to let yourself be put upon in this way now are you quite sure i can do nothing catherine in a low warning tone you can stop interrupting paul petkoff starting and looking round at her eh oh quite right my love quite right he takes his newspaper up but lets it drop again ah you havent been campaigning catherine you dont know how pleasant it is for us to sit here after a good lunch with nothing to do but enjoy ourselves theres only one thing i want to make me thoroughly comfortable catherine what is that petkoff my old coat im not at home in this one i feel as if i were on parade catherine my dear paul how absurd you are about that old coat it must be hanging in the blue closet where you left it petkoff my dear catherine i tell you ive looked there am i to believe my own eyes or not catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace what are you shewing off that bell for she looks at him majestically and silently resumes her chair and her needlework my dear if you think the obstinacy of your sex can make a coat out of two old dressing gowns of rainas your waterproof and my mackintosh youre mistaken thats exactly what the blue closet contains at present nicola presents himself catherine unmoved by petkoffs sally nicola go to the blue closet and bring your masters old coat herethe braided one he usually wears in the house nicola yes madam nicola goes out petkoff catherine catherine yes paul petkoff i bet you any piece of jewellery you like to order from sofia against a weeks housekeeping money that the coat isnt there catherine done paul petkoff excited by the prospect of a gamble come heres an opportunity for some sport wholl bet on it bluntschli ill give you six to one bluntschli imperturbably it would be robbing you major madame is sure to be right without looking up he passes another batch of papers to sergius sergius also excited bravo switzerland major i bet my best charger against an arab mare for raina that nicola finds the coat in the blue closet petkoff eagerly your best char catherine hastily interrupting him dont be foolish paul an arabian mare will cost you 50000 levas raina suddenly coming out of her picturesque revery really mother if you are going to take the jewellery i dont see why you should grudge me my arab nicola comes back with the coat and brings it to petkoff who can hardly believe his eyes catherine where was it nicola nicola hanging in the blue closet madam petkoff well i am d catherine stopping him paul petkoff i could have sworn it wasnt there age is beginning to tell on me im getting hallucinations to nicola here help me to change excuse me bluntschli he begins changing coats nicola acting as valet remember i didnt take that bet of yours sergius youd better give raina that arab steed yourself since youve roused her expectations eh raina he looks round at her but she is again rapt in the landscape with a little gush of paternal affection and pride he points her out to them and says shes dreaming as usual sergius assuredly she shall not be the loser petkoff so much the better for her i shant come off so cheap i expect the change is now complete nicola goes out with the discarded coat ah now i feel at home at last he sits down and takes his newspaper with a grunt of relief bluntschli to sergius handing a paper thats the last order petkoff jumping up what finished bluntschli finished petkoff goes beside sergius looks curiously over his left shoulder as he signs and says with childlike envy havent you anything for me to sign bluntschli not necessary his signature will do petkoff ah well i think weve done a thundering good days work he goes away from the table can i do anything more bluntschli you had better both see the fellows that are to take these to sergius pack them off at once and shew them that ive marked on the orders the time they should hand them in by tell them that if they stop to drink or tell storiesif theyre five minutes late theyll have the skin taken off their backs sergius rising indignantly ill say so and if one of them is man enough to spit in my face for insulting him ill buy his discharge and give him a pension he strides out his humanity deeply outraged bluntschli confidentially just see that he talks to them properly major will you petkoff officiously quite right bluntschli quite right ill see to it he goes to the door importantly but hesitates on the threshold by the bye catherine you may as well come too theyll be far more frightened of you than of me catherine putting down her embroidery i daresay i had better you will only splutter at them she goes out petkoff holding the door for her and following her bluntschli what a country they make cannons out of cherry trees and the officers send for their wives to keep discipline he begins to fold and docket the papers raina who has risen from the divan strolls down the room with her hands clasped behind her and looks mischievously at him raina you look ever so much nicer than when we last met he looks up surprised what have you done to yourself bluntschli washed brushed good nights sleep and breakfast thats all raina did you get back safely that morning bluntschli quite thanks raina were they angry with you for running away from sergiuss charge bluntschli no they were glad because theyd all just run away themselves raina going to the table and leaning over it towards him it must have made a lovely story for themall that about me and my room bluntschli capital story but i only told it to one of thema particular friend raina on whose discretion you could absolutely rely bluntschli absolutely raina hm he told it all to my father and sergius the day you exchanged the prisoners she turns away and strolls carelessly across to the other side of the room bluntschli deeply concerned and half incredulous no you dont mean that do you raina turning with sudden earnestness i do indeed but they dont know that it was in this house that you hid if sergius knew he would challenge you and kill you in a duel bluntschli bless me then dont tell him raina full of reproach for his levity can you realize what it is to me to deceive him i want to be quite perfect with sergiusno meanness no smallness no deceit my relation to him is the one really beautiful and noble part of my life i hope you can understand that bluntschli sceptically you mean that you wouldnt like him to find out that the story about the ice pudding was aaayou know raina wincing ah dont talk of it in that flippant way i lied i know it but i did it to save your life he would have killed you that was the second time i ever uttered a falsehood bluntschli rises quickly and looks doubtfully and somewhat severely at her do you remember the first time bluntschli i no was i present raina yes and i told the officer who was searching for you that you were not present bluntschli true i should have remembered it raina greatly encouraged ah it is natural that you should forget it first it cost you nothing it cost me a liea lie she sits down on the ottoman looking straight before her with her hands clasped on her knee bluntschli quite touched goes to the ottoman with a particularly reassuring and considerate air and sits down beside her bluntschli my dear young lady dont let this worry you remember im a soldier now what are the two things that happen to a soldier so often that he comes to think nothing of them one is hearing people tell lies raina recoils the other is getting his life saved in all sorts of ways by all sorts of people raina rising in indignant protest and so he becomes a creature incapable of faith and of gratitude bluntschli making a wry face do you like gratitude i dont if pity is akin to love gratitude is akin to the other thing raina gratitude turning on him if you are incapable of gratitude you are incapable of any noble sentiment even animals are grateful oh i see now exactly what you think of me you were not surprised to hear me lie to you it was something i probably did every dayevery hour that is how men think of women she walks up the room melodramatically bluntschli dubiously theres reason in everything you said youd told only two lies in your whole life dear young lady isnt that rather a short allowance im quite a straightforward man myself but it wouldnt last me a whole morning raina staring haughtily at him do you know sir that you are insulting me bluntschli i cant help it when you get into that noble attitude and speak in that thrilling voice i admire you but i find it impossible to believe a single word you say raina superbly captain bluntschli bluntschli unmoved yes raina coming a little towards him as if she could not believe her senses do you mean what you said just now do you know what you said just now bluntschli i do raina gasping i i she points to herself incredulously meaning i raina petkoff tell lies he meets her gaze unflinchingly she suddenly sits down beside him and adds with a complete change of manner from the heroic to the familiar how did you find me out bluntschli promptly instinct dear young lady instinct and experience of the world raina wonderingly do you know you are the first man i ever met who did not take me seriously bluntschli you mean dont you that i am the first man that has ever taken you quite seriously raina yes i suppose i do mean that cosily quite at her ease with him how strange it is to be talked to in such a way you know ive always gone on like thati mean the noble attitude and the thrilling voice i did it when i was a tiny child to my nurse she believed in it i do it before my parents they believe in it i do it before sergius he believes in it bluntschli yes hes a little in that line himself isnt he raina startled do you think so bluntschli you know him better than i do raina i wonderi wonder is he if i thought that discouraged ah well what does it matter i suppose now that youve found me out you despise me bluntschli warmly rising no my dear young lady no no no a thousand times its part of your youthpart of your charm im like all the rest of themthe nurseyour parentssergius im your infatuated admirer raina pleased really bluntschli slapping his breast smartly with his hand german fashion hand aufs herz really and truly raina very happy but what did you think of me for giving you my portrait bluntschli astonished your portrait you never gave me your portrait raina quickly do you mean to say you never got it bluntschli no he sits down beside her with renewed interest and says with some complacency when did you send it to me raina indignantly i did not send it to you she turns her head away and adds reluctantly it was in the pocket of that coat bluntschli pursing his lips and rounding his eyes ohooh i never found it it must be there still raina springing up there stillfor my father to find the first time he puts his hand in his pocket oh how could you be so stupid bluntschli rising also it doesnt matter its only a photograph how can he tell who it was intended for tell him he put it there himself raina impatiently yes that is so cleverso clever what shall i do bluntschli ah i see you wrote something on it that was rash raina annoyed almost to tears oh to have done such a thing for you who care no moreexcept to laugh at meoh are you sure nobody has touched it bluntschli well i cant be quite sure you see i couldnt carry it about with me all the time one cant take much luggage on active service raina what did you do with it bluntschli when i got through to peerot i had to put it in safe keeping somehow i thought of the railway cloak room but thats the surest place to get looted in modern warfare so i pawned it raina pawned it bluntschli i know it doesnt sound nice but it was much the safest plan i redeemed it the day before yesterday heaven only knows whether the pawnbroker cleared out the pockets or not raina furiousthrowing the words right into his face you have a low shopkeeping mind you think of things that would never come into a gentlemans head bluntschli phlegmatically thats the swiss national character dear lady raina oh i wish i had never met you she flounces away and sits at the window fuming louka comes in with a heap of letters and telegrams on her salver and crosses with her bold free gait to the table her left sleeve is looped up to the shoulder with a brooch shewing her naked arm with a broad gilt bracelet covering the bruise louka to bluntschli for you she empties the salver recklessly on the table the messenger is waiting she is determined not to be civil to a servian even if she must bring him his letters bluntschli to raina will you excuse me the last postal delivery that reached me was three weeks ago these are the subsequent accumulations four telegramsa week old he opens one oho bad news raina rising and advancing a little remorsefully bad news bluntschli my fathers dead he looks at the telegram with his lips pursed musing on the unexpected change in his arrangements raina oh how very sad bluntschli yes i shall have to start for home in an hour he has left a lot of big hotels behind him to be looked after takes up a heavy letter in a long blue envelope heres a whacking letter from the family solicitor he pulls out the enclosures and glances over them great heavens seventy two hundred in a crescendo of dismay four hundred four thousand nine thousand six hundred what on earth shall i do with them all raina timidly nine thousand hotels bluntschli hotels nonsense if you only knewoh its too ridiculous excuse me i must give my fellow orders about starting he leaves the room hastily with the documents in his hand louka tauntingly he has not much heart that swiss though he is so fond of the servians he has not a word of grief for his poor father raina bitterly griefa man who has been doing nothing but killing people for years what does he care what does any soldier care she goes to the door evidently restraining her tears with difficulty louka major saranoff has been fighting too and he has plenty of heart left raina at the door looks haughtily at her and goes out aha i thought you wouldnt get much feeling out of your soldier she is following raina when nicola enters with an armful of logs for the fire nicola grinning amorously at her ive been trying all the afternoon to get a minute alone with you my girl his countenance changes as he notices her arm why what fashion is that of wearing your sleeve child louka proudly my own fashion nicola indeed if the mistress catches you shell talk to you he throws the logs down on the ottoman and sits comfortably beside them louka is that any reason why you should take it on yourself to talk to me nicola come dont be so contrary with me ive some good news for you he takes out some paper money louka with an eager gleam in her eyes comes close to look at it see a twenty leva bill sergius gave me that out of pure swagger a fool and his money are soon parted theres ten levas more the swiss gave me that for backing up the mistresss and rainas lies about him hes no fool he isnt you should have heard old catherine downstairs as polite as you please to me telling me not to mind the major being a little impatient for they knew what a good servant i wasafter making a fool and a liar of me before them all the twenty will go to our savings and you shall have the ten to spend if youll only talk to me so as to remind me im a human being i get tired of being a servant occasionally louka scornfully yes sell your manhood for thirty levas and buy me for ten keep your money you were born to be a servant i was not when you set up your shop you will only be everybodys servant instead of somebodys servant nicola picking up his logs and going to the stove ah wait till you see we shall have our evenings to ourselves and i shall be master in my own house i promise you he throws the logs down and kneels at the stove louka you shall never be master in mine she sits down on sergiuss chair nicola turning still on his knees and squatting down rather forlornly on his calves daunted by her implacable disdain you have a great ambition in you louka remember if any luck comes to you it was i that made a woman of you louka you nicola with dogged selfassertion yes me who was it made you give up wearing a couple of pounds of false black hair on your head and reddening your lips and cheeks like any other bulgarian girl i did who taught you to trim your nails and keep your hands clean and be dainty about yourself like a fine russian lady me do you hear that me she tosses her head defiantly and he rises illhumoredly adding more coolly ive often thought that if raina were out of the way and you just a little less of a fool and sergius just a little more of one you might come to be one of my grandest customers instead of only being my wife and costing me money louka i believe you would rather be my servant than my husband you would make more out of me oh i know that soul of yours nicola going up close to her for greater emphasis never you mind my soul but just listen to my advice if you want to be a lady your present behaviour to me wont do at all unless when were alone its too sharp and impudent and impudence is a sort of familiarity it shews affection for me and dont you try being high and mighty with me either youre like all country girls you think its genteel to treat a servant the way i treat a stableboy thats only your ignorance and dont you forget it and dont be so ready to defy everybody act as if you expected to have your own way not as if you expected to be ordered about the way to get on as a lady is the same as the way to get on as a servant youve got to know your place thats the secret of it and you may depend on me to know my place if you get promoted think over it my girl ill stand by you one servant should always stand by another louka rising impatiently oh i must behave in my own way you take all the courage out of me with your coldblooded wisdom go and put those logs on the fire thats the sort of thing you understand before nicola can retort sergius comes in he checks himself a moment on seeing louka then goes to the stove sergius to nicola i am not in the way of your work i hope nicola in a smooth elderly manner oh no sir thank you kindly i was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit of running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance to look at the books thats the worst of her education sir it gives her habits above her station to louka make that table tidy louka for the major he goes out sedately louka without looking at sergius begins to arrange the papers on the table he crosses slowly to her and studies the arrangement of her sleeve reflectively sergius let me see is there a mark there he turns up the bracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp she stands motionless not looking at him fascinated but on her guard ffff does it hurt louka yes sergius shall i cure it louka instantly withdrawing herself proudly but still not looking at him no you cannot cure it now sergius masterfully quite sure he makes a movement as if to take her in his arms louka dont trifle with me please an officer should not trifle with a servant sergius touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his forefinger that was no trifle louka louka no looking at him for the first time are you sorry sergius with measured emphasis folding his arms i am never sorry louka wistfully i wish i could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as that i wonder are you really a brave man sergius unaffectedly relaxing his attitude yes i am a brave man my heart jumped like a womans at the first shot but in the charge i found that i was brave yes that at least is real about me louka did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are poor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich like you sergius with bitter levity not a bit they all slashed and cursed and yelled like heroes psha the courage to rage and kill is cheap i have an english bull terrier who has as much of that sort of courage as the whole bulgarian nation and the whole russian nation at its back but he lets my groom thrash him all the same thats your soldier all over no louka your poor men can cut throats but they are afraid of their officers they put up with insults and blows they stand by and see one another punished like childrenaye and help to do it when they are ordered and the officerswell with a short bitter laugh i am an officer oh fervently give me the man who will defy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets itself up against his own will and conscience he alone is the brave man louka how easy it is to talk men never seem to me to grow up they all have schoolboys ideas you dont know what true courage is sergius ironically indeed i am willing to be instructed louka look at me how much am i allowed to have my own will i have to get your room ready for youto sweep and dust to fetch and carry how could that degrade me if it did not degrade you to have it done for you but with subdued passion if i were empress of russia above everyone in the world thenah then though according to you i could shew no courage at all you should see you should see sergius what would you do most noble empress louka i would marry the man i loved which no other queen in europe has the courage to do if i loved you though you would be as far beneath me as i am beneath you i would dare to be the equal of my inferior would you dare as much if you loved me no if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let it grow you dare not you would marry a rich mans daughter because you would be afraid of what other people would say of you sergius carried away you lie it is not so by all the stars if i loved you and i were the czar himself i would set you on the throne by my side you know that i love another woman a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth and you are jealous of her louka i have no reason to be she will never marry you now the man i told you of has come back she will marry the swiss sergius recoiling the swiss louka a man worth ten of you then you can come to me and i will refuse you you are not good enough for me she turns to the door sergius springing after her and catching her fiercely in his arms i will kill the swiss and afterwards i will do as i please with you louka in his arms passive and steadfast the swiss will kill you perhaps he has beaten you in love he may beat you in war sergius tormentedly do you think i believe that sheshe whose worst thoughts are higher than your best ones is capable of trifling with another man behind my back louka do you think she would believe the swiss if he told her now that i am in your arms sergius releasing her in despair damnation oh damnation mockery mockery everywhere everything i think is mocked by everything i do he strikes himself frantically on the breast coward liar fool shall i kill myself like a man or live and pretend to laugh at myself she again turns to go louka she stops near the door remember you belong to me louka quietly what does that meanan insult sergius commandingly it means that you love me and that i have had you here in my arms and will perhaps have you there again whether that is an insult i neither know nor care take it as you please but vehemently i will not be a coward and a trifler if i choose to love you i dare marry you in spite of all bulgaria if these hands ever touch you again they shall touch my affianced bride louka we shall see whether you dare keep your word but take care i will not wait long sergius again folding his arms and standing motionless in the middle of the room yes we shall see and you shall wait my pleasure bluntschli much preoccupied with his papers still in his hand enters leaving the door open for louka to go out he goes across to the table glancing at her as he passes sergius without altering his resolute attitude watches him steadily louka goes out leaving the door open bluntschli absently sitting at the table as before and putting down his papers thats a remarkable looking young woman sergius gravely without moving captain bluntschli bluntschli eh sergius you have deceived me you are my rival i brook no rivals at six oclock i shall be in the drillingground on the klissoura road alone on horseback with my sabre do you understand bluntschli staring but sitting quite at his ease oh thank you thats a cavalry mans proposal im in the artillery and i have the choice of weapons if i go i shall take a machine gun and there shall be no mistake about the cartridges this time sergius flushing but with deadly coldness take care sir it is not our custom in bulgaria to allow invitations of that kind to be trifled with bluntschli warmly pooh dont talk to me about bulgaria you dont know what fighting is but have it your own way bring your sabre along ill meet you sergius fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of spirit well said switzer shall i lend you my best horse bluntschli no damn your horsethank you all the same my dear fellow raina comes in and hears the next sentence i shall fight you on foot horsebacks too dangerous i dont want to kill you if i can help it raina hurrying forward anxiously i have heard what captain bluntschli said sergius you are going to fight why sergius turns away in silence and goes to the stove where he stands watching her as she continues to bluntschli what about bluntschli i dont know he hasnt told me better not interfere dear young lady no harm will be done ive often acted as sword instructor he wont be able to touch me and ill not hurt him it will save explanations in the morning i shall be off home and youll never see me or hear of me again you and he will then make it up and live happily ever after raina turning away deeply hurt almost with a sob in her voice i never said i wanted to see you again sergius striding forward ha that is a confession raina haughtily what do you mean sergius you love that man raina scandalized sergius sergius you allow him to make love to you behind my back just as you accept me as your affianced husband behind his bluntschli you knew our relations and you deceived me it is for that that i call you to account not for having received favours that i never enjoyed bluntschli jumping up indignantly stuff rubbish i have received no favours why the young lady doesnt even know whether im married or not raina forgetting herself oh collapsing on the ottoman are you sergius you see the young ladys concern captain bluntschli denial is useless you have enjoyed the privilege of being received in her own room late at night bluntschli interrupting him pepperily yes you blockhead she received me with a pistol at her head your cavalry were at my heels id have blown out her brains if shed uttered a cry sergius taken aback bluntschli raina is this true raina rising in wrathful majesty oh how dare you how dare you bluntschli apologize man apologize he resumes his seat at the table sergius with the old measured emphasis folding his arms i never apologize raina passionately this is the doing of that friend of yours captain bluntschli it is he who is spreading this horrible story about me she walks about excitedly bluntschli no hes deadburnt alive raina stopping shocked burnt alive bluntschli shot in the hip in a wood yard couldnt drag himself out your fellows shells set the timber on fire and burnt him with half a dozen other poor devils in the same predicament raina how horrible sergius and how ridiculous oh war war the dream of patriots and heroes a fraud bluntschli a hollow sham like love raina outraged like love you say that before me bluntschli come saranoff that matter is explained sergius a hollow sham i say would you have come back here if nothing had passed between you

springing up ah i forgot that louka coldly you can withdraw if you like sergius withdraw never you belong to me he puts his arm about her and draws her to him catherine comes in and finds louka in sergiuss arms and all the rest gazing at them in bewildered astonishment catherine what does this mean sergius releases louka petkoff well my dear it appears that sergius is going to marry louka

bound by your word to us sergius folding his arms nothing binds me bluntschli much pleased by this piece of common sense saranoff your hand my congratulations these heroics of yours have their practical side after all to louka gracious young lady the best wishes of a good republican he kisses her hand to rainas great disgust catherine threateningly louka you have been telling stories louka i have done raina no harm catherine haughtily raina raina is equally indignant at the liberty louka i have a right to call her raina she calls me louka i told major saranoff she would never marry him if the swiss gentleman came back bluntschli surprised hallo louka turning to raina i thought you were fonder of him than of sergius you know best whether i was right bluntschli what nonsense i assure

fifteen years of barracks and battlesa vagabonda man who has spoiled all his chances in life through an incurably romantic dispositiona man sergius starting as if a needle had pricked him and interrupting bluntschli in incredulous amazement excuse me bluntschli what did you say had spoiled your chances in life bluntschli promptly an incurably romantic disposition i ran away from home twice when i was a boy i went into the army instead of into my fathers business i climbed the balcony of this house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest cellar i came sneaking back here to have another look at the young lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat back petkoff my coat bluntschliyes thats the coat i meanwould have sent it back and gone quietly home do you suppose i am the sort of fellow a young girl falls in love with why look at our ages im thirtyfour i dont suppose the young lady is much over seventeen this estimate produces a marked sensation all the rest turning and staring at one another he proceeds innocently all that adventure which was life or death to me was only a schoolgirls game to herchocolate creams and hide and seek heres the proof he takes the photograph from the table now i ask you would a woman who took the affair seriously have sent me this and written on it raina to her chocolate cream soldiera souvenir he exhibits the photograph triumphantly as if it settled the matter beyond all possibility of refutation petkoff thats what i was looking for how the deuce did it get there bluntschli to raina complacently i have put everything right i hope gracious young lady raina in uncontrollable vexation i quite agree with your account of yourself you are a romantic idiot bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback next time i hope you will know the difference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of twentythree bluntschli stupefied twentythree she snaps the photograph contemptuously from his hand tears it across and throws the pieces at his feet sergius with grim enjoyment of bluntschlis discomfiture bluntschli my one last belief is gone your sagacity is a fraud like all the other things you have less sense than even i have bluntschli overwhelmed twentythree twentythree he considers hm swiftly making up his mind in that case major petkoff i beg to propose formally to become a suitor for your daughters hand in place of major saranoff retired raina you dare bluntschli if you were twentythree when you said those things to me this afternoon i shall take them seriously catherine loftily polite i doubt sir

bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world miss hardcastle eh you have frozen me to death again that word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments a reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband hardcastle on the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues it was the very feature in his character that first struck me miss hardcastle he must have more striking features to catch me i promise you however if he be so young so handsome and so everything as you mention i believe hell do still i think ill have him hardcastle ay kate but there is still an obstacle its more than an even wager he may not have you miss hardcastle my dear papa why will you mortify one sowell if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference ill only break my glass for its flattery set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer hardcastle bravely resolved in the mean time ill go

in a flutter young handsome these he put last but i put them foremost sensible goodnatured i like all that but then reserved and sheepish thats much against him yet cant he be cured of his timidity by

as i live the most intimate friend of mr hastings my admirer they are never asunder i believe you must have seen him when we lived in town miss hardcastle never miss neville hes a very singular character i assure you among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me miss hardcastle an odd character indeed i shall never be able to manage him what shall i do pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success but how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother tony as usual miss neville i have just come from one of our agreeable teteatetes she has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection miss hardcastle and her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so a fortune like yours is no small temptation besides as she has the sole management of it im not surprised to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family miss neville a fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation but at any rate if my dear hastings be but constant i make no doubt to be too hard for her at last however i let her suppose that i am in love with her son and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another miss hardcastle my good brother holds out stoutly i could almost love him for hating you so miss neville it is a goodnatured creature at bottom and im sure would wish to see me married to anybody but

welcome gentlemen very welcome this way hastings after the disappointments of the day welcome once more charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable marlow the usual fate of a large mansion having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn hastings as you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries i have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece though not actually put in the bill inflame a reckoning confoundedly marlow travellers george must pay in all places the only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved hastings you have lived very much among them in truth i have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance marlow the englishmans malady but tell me george where could i have learned that assurance you talk of my life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence i dont know that i was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest womanexcept my motherbut among females of another class you know hastings ay among them you are impudent enough of all conscience marlow they are of us you know hastings but in the company of women of reputation i never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room marlow why man thats because i do want to steal out of the room faith i have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate but i dont know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution an impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but ill be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence hastings if you could but say half the fine things to them that i have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bedmaker marlow why george i cant say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me they may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle but to me a modest woman drest out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation hastings ha ha ha at this rate man how can you ever expect to marry marlow never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy if indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured but to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of madam will you marry me no no thats a strain much above me i assure you hastings i pity you but how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father marlow as i behave to all other ladies bow very low answer yes or no to all her demandsbut for the rest i dont think i shall venture to look in her face till i see my fathers again hastings im surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover marlow to be explicit my dear hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own miss neville loves you the family dont know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honour do the rest hastings my dear marlow but ill suppress the emotion were i a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world i would apply to for assistance but miss nevilles person is all i ask and that is mine both from her deceased fathers consent and her own inclination marlow happy man you have talents and art to captivate any woman im doomd to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it i despise this stammer in my address and this awkward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliners prentice or one of the duchesses of drurylane pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us enter hardcastle hardcastle gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome which is mr marlow sir you are heartily welcome its not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire i like give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate i like to see their horses and trunks taken care of marlow aside he has got our names from the servants already to him we approve your caution and hospitality sir to hastings i have been thinking george of changing our travelling dresses in the morning i am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine hardcastle i beg mr marlow youll use no ceremony in this house hastings i fancy charles youre right the first blow is half the battle i intend opening the campaign with the white and gold hardcastle mr marlowmr hastingsgentlemenpray be under no constraint in this house this is libertyhall gentlemen you may do just as you please here marlow yet george if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over i think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat hardcastle your talking of a retreat mr marlow puts me in mind of the duke of marlborough when we went to besiege denain he first summoned the garrison marlow dont you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown hardcastle he first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men hastings i think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly hardcastle i say gentlemen as i was telling you be summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men marlow the girls like finery hardcastle which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war now says the duke of marlborough to george brooks that stood next to himyou must have heard of george brooksill pawn my dukedom says he but i take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood so marlow what my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour hardcastle punch sir aside this is the most unaccountable kind of modesty i ever met with marlow yes sir punch a glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable this is libertyhall you know hardcastle heres a cup sir marlow aside so this fellow in his libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases hardcastle taking the cup i hope youll find it to your mind i have prepared it with my own hands and i believe youll own the ingredients are tolerable will you be so good as to pledge me sir here mr marlow here is to our better acquaintance drinks marlow aside a very impudent fellow this but hes a character and ill humour him a little sir my service to you drinks hastings aside i see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that hes an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman marlow from the excellence of your cup my old friend i suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country warm work now and then at elections i suppose hardcastle no sir i have long given that work over since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business for us that sell ale hastings so then you have no turn for politics i find hardcastle not in the least there was a time indeed i fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better i left it to mend itself since that i no more trouble my head about hyder ally or ally cawn than about ally croker sir my service to you hastings so that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it hardcastle i do stir about a great deal thats certain half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour marlow after drinking and you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in westminsterhall hardcastle ay young gentleman that and a little philosophy marlow aside well this is the first time i ever heard of an innkeepers philosophy hastings so then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter if you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this heres your health my philosopher drinks hardcastle good very good thank you ha ha your generalship puts me in mind of prince eugene when he fought the turks at the battle of belgrade you shall hear marlow instead of the battle of belgrade i believe its almost time to talk about supper what has your philosophy got in the house for supper hardcastle for supper sir aside was ever such a request to a man in his own house marlow yes sir supper sir i begin to feel an appetite i shall make devilish work tonight in the larder i promise you hardcastle aside such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld to him why really sir as for supper i cant well tell my dorothy and the cookmaid settle these things between them i leave these kind of things entirely to them marlow you do do you hardcastle entirely by the bye i believe they are in actual consultation upon whats for supper this moment in the kitchen marlow then i beg theyll admit me as one of their privy council its a way i have got when i travel i always chose to regulate my own supper let the cook be called no offence i hope sir hardcastle o no sir none in the least yet i dont know how our bridget the cookmaid is not very communicative upon these occasions should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house hastings lets see your list of the larder then i ask it as a favour i always match my appetite to my bill of fare marlow to hardcastle who looks at them with surprise sir hes very right and its my way too hardcastle sir you have a right to command here here roger bring us the bill of fare for tonights supper i believe its drawn outyour manner mr hastings puts me in mind of my uncle colonel wallop it was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it hastings aside all upon the high rope his uncle a colonel we shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace but lets hear the bill of fare marlow perusing whats here for the first course for the second course for the dessert the devil sir do you think we have brought down a whole joiners company or the corporation of bedford to eat up such a supper two or three little things clean and comfortable will do hastings but lets hear it marlow reading for the first course at the top a pig and prune sauce hastings damn your pig i say marlow and damn your prune sauce say i hardcastle and yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with prune sauce is very good eating marlow at the bottom a calfs tongue and brains hastings let your brains be knocked out my good sir i dont like them marlow or you may clap them on a plate by themselves i do hardcastle aside their impudence confounds me to them gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen marlow item a pork pie a boiled rabbit and sausages a florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tifftafftaffety cream hastings confound your made dishes i shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the french ambassadors table im for plain eating hardcastle im sorry gentlemen that i have nothing you like but if there be anything you have a particular fancy to marlow why really sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another send us what you please so much for supper and now to see that our beds are aired and properly taken care of hardcastle i entreat youll leave that to me you shall not stir a step marlow leave that to you i protest sir you must excuse me i always look to these things myself hardcastle i must insist sir youll make yourself easy on that head marlow you see im resolved on it aside a very troublesome fellow this as i ever met with hardcastle well sir im resolved at least to attend you aside this may be modern modesty but i never saw anything look so like oldfashioned impudence exeunt marlow and hardcastle hastings alone so i find this fellows civilities begin to grow troublesome but who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him ha what do i see miss neville by all thats happy enter miss neville miss neville my dear hastings to what unexpected good fortune to what accident am i to ascribe this happy meeting hastings rather let me ask the same question as i could never have hoped to meet my dearest constance at an inn miss neville an inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here what could induce you to think this house an inn hastings my friend mr marlow with whom i came down and i have been sent here as to an inn i assure you a young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither miss neville certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousins tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha hastings he whom your aunt intends for you he of whom i have such just apprehensions miss neville you have nothing to fear from him i assure you youd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me my aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest hastings thou dear dissembler you must know my constance i have just seized this happy opportunity of my friends visit here to get admittance into the family the horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but theyll soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful hastings we shall soon be landed in france where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected miss neville i have often told you that though ready to obey you i yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance the greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the india director and chiefly consists in jewels i have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them i fancy im very near succeeding the instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours hastings perish the baubles your person is all i desire in the mean time my friend marlow must not be let into his mistake i know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution miss neville but how shall we keep him in the deception miss hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive himthis this waythey confer enter marlow marlow the assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond bearing my host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back they talk of coming to sup with us too and then i suppose we are to run the gantlet through all the rest of the familywhat have we got here hastings my dear charles let me congratulate youthe most fortunate accidentwho do you think is just alighted marlow cannot guess hastings our mistresses boy miss hardcastle and miss neville give me leave to introduce miss constance neville to your acquaintance happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here miss hardcastle has just stept into the next room and will be back in an instant wasnt it lucky eh marlow aside i have been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment hastings well but wasnt it the most fortunate thing in the world marlow oh yes very fortunatea most joyful encounterbut our dresses george you know are in disorderwhat if we should postpone the happiness till tomorrowtomorrow at her own houseit will be every bit as convenientand rather more respectfultomorrow let it be offering to go miss neville by no means sir your ceremony will displease her the disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her marlow o the devil how shall i support it hem hem hastings you must not go you are to assist me you know i shall be confoundedly ridiculous yet hang it ill take courage hem hastings pshaw man its but the first plunge and alls over shes but a woman you know marlow and of all women she that i dread most to encounter enter miss hardcastle as returned from walking a bonnet etc hastings introducing them miss hardcastle mr marlow im proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other miss hardcastle aside now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner after a pause in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted im glad of your safe arrival sir im told you had some accidents by the way marlow only a few madam yes we had some yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorrymadamor rather glad of any accidentsthat are so agreeably concluded hem hastings to him you never spoke better in your whole life keep it up and ill insure you the victory miss hardcastle im afraid you flatter sir you that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country marlow gathering courage i have lived indeed in the world madam but i have kept very little company i have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it miss neville but that i am told is the way to enjoy it at last hastings to him cicero never spoke better once more and you are confirmed in assurance for ever marlow to him hem stand by me then and when im down throw in a word or two to set me up again miss hardcastle an observer like you upon life were i fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve marlow pardon me madam i was always willing to be amused the folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness hastings to him bravo bravo never spoke so well in your whole life well miss hardcastle i see that you and mr marlow are going to be very good company i believe our being here will but embarrass the interview marlow not in the least mr hastings we like your company of all things to him zounds george sure you wont go how can you leave us hastings our presence will but spoil conversation so well retire to the next room to him you dont consider man that we are to manage a little teteatete of our own exeunt miss hardcastle after a pause but you have not been wholly an observer i presume sir the ladies i should hope have employed some part of your addresses marlow relapsing into timidity pardon me madam iiias yet have studiedonlytodeserve them miss hardcastle and that some say is the very worst way to obtain them marlow perhaps so madam but i love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex but im afraid i grow tiresome miss hardcastle not at all sir there is nothing i like so much as grave conversation myself i could hear it for ever indeed i have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart marlow itsa diseaseof the mind madam in the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relishforumaum miss hardcastle i understand you sir there must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting marlow my meaning madam but infinitely better expressed and i cant help observinga miss hardcastle aside who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions to him you were going to observe sir marlow i was observing madami protest madam i forget what i was going to observe miss hardcastle aside i vow and so do i to him you were observing sir that in this age of hypocrisysomething about hypocrisy sir marlow yes madam in this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict inquiry do notaaa miss hardcastle i understand you perfectly sir marlow aside egad and thats more than i do myself miss hardcastle you mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it marlow true madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms but im sure i tire you madam miss hardcastle not in the least sir theres something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and forcepray sir go on marlow yes madam i was sayingthat there are some occasions when a total want of courage madam destroys all theand puts usupon aaa miss hardcastle i agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel i beg youll proceed marlow yes madam morally speaking madambut i see miss neville expecting us in the next room i would not intrude for the world miss hardcastle i protest sir i never was more agreeably entertained in all my life pray go on marlow yes madam i wasbut she beckons us to join her madam shall i do myself the honour to attend you miss hardcastle well then ill follow marlow aside this pretty smooth dialogue has done for me exit miss hardcastle alone ha ha ha was there ever such a sober sentimental interview im certain he scarce looked in my face the whole time yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too he has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance if i could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that i know of a piece of service but who is that somebodythat faith is a question i can scarce answer exit enter tony and miss neville followed by mrs hardcastle and hastings tony what do you follow me for cousin con i wonder youre not ashamed to be so very engaging miss neville i hope cousin one may speak to ones own relations and not be to blame tony ay but i know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it wont do i tell you cousin con it wont do so i beg youll keep your distance i want no nearer relationship she follows coquetting him to the back scene mrs hardcastle well i vow mr hastings you are very entertaining theres nothing in the world i love to talk of so much as london and the fashions though i was never there myself hastings never there you amaze me from your air and manner i concluded you had been bred all your life either at ranelagh st jamess or tower wharf mrs hardcastle o sir youre only pleased to say so we country persons can have no manner at all im in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the pantheon the grotto gardens the borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort all i can do is to enjoy london at secondhand i take care to know every teteatete from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two miss rickets of crooked lane pray how do you like this head mr hastings hastings extremely elegant and degagee upon my word madam your friseur is a frenchman i suppose mrs hardcastle i protest i dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year hastings indeed such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady mayoress at a city ball mrs hardcastle i vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd hastings but that can never be your case madam in any dress bowing mrs hardcastle yet what signifies my dressing when i have such a piece of antiquity by my side as mr hardcastle all i can say will never argue down a single button from his clothes i have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaster it over like my lord pately with powder hastings you are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old mrs hardcastle but what do you think his answer was why with his usual gothic vivacity he said i only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tete for my own wearing hastings intolerable at your age you may wear what you please and it must become you mrs hardcastle pray mr hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town hastings some time ago forty was all the mode but im told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter mrs hardcastle seriously then i shall be too young for the fashion hastings no lady begins now to put on jewels till shes past forty for instance miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers mrs hardcastle and yet mrs niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all hastings your niece is she and that young gentleman a brother of yours i should presume mrs hardcastle my son sir they are contracted to each other observe their little sports they fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already to them well tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin constance this evening tony i have been saying no soft things but that its very hard to be followed about so ecod ive not a place in the house now thats left to myself but the stable mrs hardcastle never mind him con my dear hes in another story behind your back miss neville theres something generous in my cousins manner he falls out before faces to be forgiven in private tony thats a damned confoundedcrack mrs hardcastle ah hes a sly one dont you think they are like each other about the mouth mr hastings the blenkinsop mouth to a t theyre of a size too back to back my pretties that mr hastings may see you come tony tony you had as good not make me i tell you measuring miss neville o lud he has almost cracked my head mrs hardcastle o the monster for shame tony you a man and behave so tony if im a man let me have my fortin ecod ill not be made a fool of no longer mrs hardcastle is this ungrateful boy all that im to get for the pains i have taken in your education i that have rocked you in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon did not i work that waistcoat to make you genteel did not i prescribe for you every day and weep while the receipt was operating tony ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since i was born i have gone through every receipt in the complete huswife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through quincy next spring but ecod i tell you ill not be made a fool of no longer mrs hardcastle wasnt it all for your good viper wasnt it all for your good tony i wish youd let me and my good alone then snubbing this way when im in spirits if im to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so mrs hardcastle thats false i never see you when youre in spirits no tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel im never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster tony ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two mrs hardcastle was ever the like but i see he wants to break my heart i see he does hastings dear madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little im certain i can persuade him to his duty mrs hardcastle well i must retire come constance my love you see mr hastings the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy exeunt mrs hardcastle and miss neville tony singing there was a young man riding by and fain would have his will rang do didlo deedont mind her let her cry its the comfort of her heart i have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry hastings then youre no friend to the ladies i find my pretty young gentleman tony thats as i find um hastings not to her of your mothers choosing i dare answer and yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl tony thats because you dont know her as well as i ecod i know every inch about her and theres not a more bitter cantankerous toad in all christendom hastings aside pretty encouragement this for a lover tony i have seen her since the height of that she has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first days breaking hastings to me she appears sensible and silent tony ay before company but when shes with her playmate shes as loud as a hog in a gate hastings but there is a meek modesty about her that charms me tony yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and youre flung in a ditch hastings well but you must allow her a little beautyyes you must allow her some beauty tony bandbox shes all a madeup thing mun ah could you but see bet bouncer of these parts you might then talk of beauty ecod she has two eyes as black as sloes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion shed make two of she hastings well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands tony anon hastings would you thank him that would take miss neville and leave you to happiness and your dear betsy tony ay but where is there such a friend for who would take her hastings i am he if you but assist me ill engage to whip her off to france and you shall never hear more of her tony assist you ecod i will to the last drop of my blood ill clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may he get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of hastings my dear squire this looks like a lad of spirit tony come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me singing we are the boys that fears no noise where the thundering cannons roar exeunt enter hardcastle alone hardcastle what could my old friend sir charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town to me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue he has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already he took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of im desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter she will certainly be shocked at it enter miss hardcastle plainly dressed hardcastle well my kate i see you have changed your dress as i bade you and yet i believe there was no great occasion miss hardcastle i find such a pleasure sir in obeying your commands that i take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety hardcastle and yet kate i sometimes give you some cause particularly when i recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today miss hardcastle you taught me to expect something extraordinary and i find the original exceeds the description hardcastle i was never so surprised in my life he has quite confounded all my faculties miss hardcastle i never saw anything like it and a man of the world too hardcastle ay he learned it all abroadwhat a fool was i to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling he might as soon learn wit at a masquerade miss hardcastle it seems all natural to him hardcastle a good deal assisted by bad company and a french dancingmaster miss hardcastle sure you mistake papa a french dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid lookthat awkward addressthat bashful manner hardcastle whose look whose manner child miss hardcastle mr marlows his mauvaise honte his timidity struck me at the first sight hardcastle then your first sight deceived you for i think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses miss hardcastle sure sir you rally i never saw any one so modest hardcastle and can you be serious i never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since i was born bully dawson was but a fool to him miss hardcastle surprising he met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground hardcastle he met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again miss hardcastle he treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam i would not for the world detain you hardcastle he spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when i was in my best story of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene he asked if i had not a good hand at making punch yes kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch miss hardcastle one of us must certainly be mistaken hardcastle if he be what he has shown himself im determined he shall never have my consent miss hardcastle and if he be the sullen thing i take him he shall never have mine hardcastle in one thing then we are agreedto reject him miss hardcastle yes but upon conditions for if you should find him less impudent and i more presumingif you find him more respectful and i more importunatei dont knowthe fellow is well enough for a mancertainly we dont meet many such at a horserace in the country hardcastle if we should find him sobut thats impossible the first appearance has done my business im seldom deceived in that miss hardcastle and yet there may be

resolved to keep up the delusion tell me pimple how do you like my present dress dont you think i look something like cherry in the beaux stratagem maid its the dress madam that every lady wears in the country but when she visits or receives company miss hardcastle and are you sure he does not remember my face or person maid certain of it miss hardcastle i vow i thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me maid but what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake miss hardcastle in the first place i shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market then i shall perhaps make an acquaintance and thats no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex but my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giants force before i offer to combat maid but you are sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person miss hardcastle never fear me i think i have got the true bar cantdid your honour callattend the lion therepipes and tobacco for the angelthe lamb has been outrageous this halfhour maid it will do madam but hes here exit maid enter

parts french i suppose we sell no french wines here sir marlow of true english growth i assure you miss hardcastle then its odd i should not know it we brew all sorts of wines in this house and i have

child you use me extremely ill if you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and i can ever be acquainted miss hardcastle and who wants to be acquainted with you i want no such acquaintance not i im sure you did not treat miss hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner ill warrant me before her you looked dashed and kept bowing to the ground and talked for all the world as if you was before a justice of peace marlow aside egad she has hit it sure enough to her in awe of her child ha ha ha a mere awkward squinting thing no no i find you dont know me i laughed and rallied her a little but i was unwilling to be too severe no i could not be too severe curse me miss hardcastle o then sir you are a favourite i find among the ladies marlow yes my dear a great

now my angel such beauty fires beyond the power of resistancepshaw the father here my old luck i never nicked seven that i did not throw ames ace three times following exit marlow enter hardcastle who stands in surprise hardcastle so madam so i find this is your modest lover this is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground and only adored at humble distance kate kate art thou not ashamed to deceive your father so miss hardcastle never trust me dear papa but hes still the modest man i first took him for youll be convinced of it as well as i hardcastle by the hand of my body i believe his impudence is infectious didnt i see him seize your hand didnt i see him haul you about like a milkmaid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth miss hardcastle but if i shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age i hope youll forgive him hardcastle the girl would actually make one run mad i tell you ill not be convinced i am convinced he has scarce been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives you may like his impudence and call it modesty but my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications miss hardcastle sir i ask but this night to convince you hardcastle you shall not have half the time for i have thoughts of turning him out this very hour miss hardcastle give me that hour then and i hope to satisfy you hardcastle well an hour let it be then but ill have no trifling with your father all fair and open do

time ill go and amuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin exit enter marlow followed by a servant marlow i wonder what hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him when he knows the only place i have is the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor have you deposited the casket with the landlady as i ordered you have you put it into her own hands servant yes your honour marlow she said shed keep it safe did she servant yes she said shed keep it safe enough she asked me how i came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself exit servant marlow ha ha ha theyre safe however what an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst this little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family shes mine she must be mine or im greatly mistaken enter hastings hastings bless me i quite forgot to tell her that i intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden marlow here and in spirits too marlow give me joy george crown me shadow me with laurels well george after all we modest fellows dont want for success among the women hastings some women

bunch of keys to its girdle hastings well and what then marlow shes mine you rogue you such fire such motion such eyes such lips but egad she would not let me kiss them though hastings but are you so sure so very sure of her marlow why man she talked of showing me her work above stairs and i am to improve the pattern hastings but how can you charles go about to rob a woman of her honour marlow pshaw pshaw we all know the honour of the barmaid of an inn i dont intend to rob her take my word for it theres nothing in this house i shant honestly pay for hastings i believe the girl has virtue marlow and if she has i should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it hastings you have taken care i hope of the casket i sent you to lock up is it in safety marlow yes yes its safe enough i have taken care of it but how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor a place of safety ah numskull i have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourselfi have hastings what marlow i have sent it to the landlady to keep for you hastings to the landlady marlow the landlady hastings you did marlow i did shes to be answerable for its forthcoming you know hastings yes shell bring it forth with a witness marlow wasnt i right i believe youll allow that i acted prudently upon this occasion hastings aside he must not see my uneasiness marlow you seem a little disconcerted though methinks sure nothing has happened hastings no nothing never was in better spirits in all my life and so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge marlow rather too readily for she not only kept the casket but through her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too ha ha ha hastings he he he theyre safe however marlow as a guinea in a misers purse hastings aside so now all hopes of fortune are at an end and we must set off without it to him well charles ill leave you to your meditations on the pretty barmaid and he he

soul sir i dont want much entreaty i generally make my fathers son welcome wherever he goes hardcastle i believe you do from my soul sir but though i say nothing to your own conduct that of your servants is insufferable their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house i assure you marlow i protest my very good sir that is no fault of mine if they dont drink as they ought they are to blame i ordered them not to spare the cellar i did i assure you to the side scene here let one of my servants come up to him my positive directions were that as i did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below hardcastle then they had your orders for what they do im satisfied marlow they had i assure you you shall hear from one of themselves enter servant drunk

such impudence curse me never in my whole life before hardcastle nor i confound me if ever i did to come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me this house is mine sir by all thats impudent it makes me laugh ha ha ha pray sir bantering as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture theres a pair of silver candlesticks and theres a firescreen and heres a pair of brazennosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them marlow bring me your bill sir bring me your bill and lets make no more words about it hardcastle there are a set of prints too what think you of the rakes progress for your own apartment marlow bring me your bill i say and ill leave you and

after a hearty meal marlow zounds bring me my bill i say and lets hear no more ont hardcastle young man young man from your fathers letter to me i was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now i find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it exit marlow hows this sure i have not mistaken the house everything looks like an inn the servants cry coming the attendance is awkward the barmaid too to attend us but shes here and will further inform me whither so fast child a word with you enter miss hardcastle miss hardcastle let it be short then im in a hurry aside i believe be begins to find out his mistake but its too soon quite to undeceive him marlow pray child answer me one question what are you and what may your business in this house be miss hardcastle a relation of the family sir marlow what a poor relation miss hardcastle yes sir a poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them marlow that is you act as the barmaid of this inn miss hardcastle inn o lawwhat brought that in your head one of the best families in the country keep an innha ha ha old mr hardcastles house an inn marlow mr hardcastles house is this mr hardcastles house child miss hardcastle ay sure whose else should it be marlow so then alls out and i have been damnably imposed on o confound my stupid head i shall be laughed at over the whole town i shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops the dullissimo maccaroni to mistake this house of all others for an inn and my fathers old friend for an innkeeper what a swaggering puppy must he take me for what a silly puppy do i find myself there again may i be hanged my dear but i mistook you for the barmaid miss hardcastle dear me dear me im sure theres nothing in my behaviour to put me on a level with one of that stamp marlow nothing my dear nothing but i was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber my stupidity saw everything the wrong way i mistook your assiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement but its over this house i no more show my face in miss hardcastle i hope sir i have done nothing to disoblige you im sure i should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me im sure i should be sorry pretending to cry if he left the family upon my account im sure i should be sorry if people said anything amiss since i have no fortune but my character marlow aside by heaven she weeps this is the first mark of tenderness i ever had from a modest woman and it touches me to her excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family i leave with reluctance but to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education makes an honourable connexion impossible and i can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely miss hardcastle aside generous man i now begin to admire him to him but i am sure my family is as good as miss hardcastles and though im poor thats no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment i never thought that it was bad to want fortune marlow and why now my pretty simplicity miss hardcastle because it puts me at a distance from one that if i had a thousand pounds i would give it all to marlow aside this simplicity bewitches me so that if i stay im undone i must make one bold effort and leave her to her your partiality in my favour my dear touches me most sensibly and were i to live for myself alone i could easily fix my choice but i owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so thati can scarcely speak itit affects me farewell exit miss hardcastle i never knew half his merit till now he shall not go if i have power or art to detain him ill still preserve the character in which i stooped to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution exit enter tony and miss neville tony ay you may steal for yourselves the next time i have done my duty she has got the jewels again thats a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants miss neville but my dear cousin sure you wont forsake us in this distress if she in the least suspects that i am going off i shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt pedigrees which is ten times worse tony to be sure aunts of all kinds are damned bad things but what can i do i have got you a pair of horses that will fly like whistlejacket and im sure you cant say but i have courted you nicely before her face here she comes we must court a bit or two more for fear she should suspect us they retire and seem to fondle enter mrs hardcastle mrs hardcastle well i was greatly fluttered to be sure but my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants i shant be easy however till they are fairly married and then let her keep her own fortune but what do i see fondling together as im alive i never saw tony so sprightly before ah have i caught you my pretty doves what billing exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs ah tony as for murmurs mother we grumble a little now and then to be sure but theres no love lost between us mrs hardcastle a mere sprinkling tony upon the flame only to make it burn brighter miss neville cousin tony promises to give us more of his company at home indeed he shant leave us any more it wont leave us cousin tony will it tony o its a pretty creature no id sooner leave my horse in a pound than leave you when you smile upon one so your laugh makes you so becoming miss neville agreeable cousin who can help admiring that natural humour that pleasant broad red thoughtless patting his cheekah its a bold face mrs hardcastle pretty innocence tony im sure i always loved cousin cons hazle eyes and her pretty long fingers that she twists this way and that over the haspicholls like a parcel of bobbins mrs hardcastle ah he would charm the bird from the tree i was never so happy before my boy takes after his father poor mr lumpkin exactly the

name is well enough but when i come to open it its allbuzz thats hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence mrs hardcastle ha ha ha very well very well and so my son was too hard for the philosopher miss neville yes madam but you must hear the rest madam a little more this way or he may hear us youll hear how he puzzled him again mrs hardcastle he seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks tony still gazing a damned up and down hand as if it was disguised in liquorreading dear siray thats that then theres an m and a t and an s but whether the next

charles and hardcastle hardcastle ha ha ha the peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands sir charles and the reserve with which i suppose he treated all your advances hardcastle and

anything but joy yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and though my daughters fortune is but small sir charles why dick will you talk of fortune

manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your ifs i warrant him enter marlow marlow i come sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct i can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion hardcastle tut boy a trifle you take it too gravely an hour or twos laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again shell never like you the worse for it marlow sir i shall be always

happiness hardcastle come boy im an old fellow and know whats what as well as you that are younger i know what has passed between you but mum marlow sure sir nothing has passed between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on hers you dont think sir that my impudence has been passed upon all the rest of the family hardcastle impudence no i dont say thatnot quite impudencethough girls like to be played with and rumpled a little too sometimes but she has told no tales i assure you marlow i never gave her the slightest cause hardcastle well well i like modesty

father approves the match i admire it every moments delay will be doing mischief so marlow but why wont you hear me by all thats just and true i never gave miss hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection we had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting hardcastle aside this fellows formal modest impudence is beyond bearing sir charles and you never grasped her hand or made any protestations marlow as heaven is my witness i came down in obedience to your commands i saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance i hope youll exact no farther proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which i suffer so many mortifications exit sir charles im astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted hardcastle and im astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance sir charles i dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth hardcastle here comes my daughter and i would stake my happiness upon her veracity enter miss hardcastle hardcastle kate come hither child answer us sincerely and without reserve has mr marlow made you any professions of love and affection miss hardcastle the question is very abrupt sir but since you require unreserved sincerity i think he has hardcastle to sir charles you see sir charles and pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview miss hardcastle yes sir several hardcastle to sir charles you see sir charles but did be profess any attachment miss hardcastle a lasting one sir charles did he talk of love miss hardcastle much sir sir charles amazing and all this formally miss hardcastle formally hardcastle now my friend i hope you are satisfied sir charles and how did he behave madam miss hardcastle as most profest admirers do said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture sir charles now im perfectly convinced indeed i know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive this forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and i am confident he never sat for the picture miss hardcastle then what sir if i should convince you to your face of my sincerity if you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person sir charles agreed and if i find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end exit miss hardcastle and if you dont find him what i describei fear my happiness must never have a beginning exeunt scene changes to the back of the garden enter hastings hastings what an idiot am i to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying

of your word this looks like friendship tony ay im your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all this riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome it has shook me worse

bottom of the garden hastings but no accident i hope tony no no only mother is confoundedly frightened she thinks herself forty miles off shes sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl so if

date our happiness from this very moment perish fortune love and content will increase what we possess beyond a monarchs revenue let me prevail miss neville no mr hastings no prudence once more comes to my relief and i will obey its dictates in the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance im resolved to apply to mr hardcastles compassion and justice for redress hastings but though he had the will he has not the power to relieve you miss neville but he has influence and upon that i am resolved to rely hastings i have no hopes but since you persist i must reluctantly obey you exeunt scene changes enter sir charles and miss hardcastle sir charles what a situation am i in if what you say appears i shall then find a guilty son if what he says be true

did i till this moment know the pain i feel in the separation miss hardcastle in her own natural manner i believe sufferings cannot be very great sir which you can so easily remove a day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by showing the little value of what you now think proper to regret marlow aside this girl every moment improves upon me to her it must not be madam i have already trifled too long with my heart my very pride begins to submit to my passion the disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution miss hardcastle then go sir ill urge nothing more to detain you though my family be as good as hers you came down to visit and my education i hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence i must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit i must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune enter hardcastle and sir charles from behind sir charles here behind this screen hardcastle ay ay make no noise ill engage my kate covers him with confusion at last marlow by heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion but every moment that i converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression what at first seemed rustic plainness now appears refined simplicity what seemed forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue sir charles what can it mean he amazes me hardcastle i told you how it would be hush marlow i am now determined to stay madam and i have too good an opinion of my fathers discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation miss hardcastle no mr marlow i will not cannot detain you do you think i could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance do you think i would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion do you think i could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours marlow by all thats good i can have no happiness but whats in your power to grant me nor shall i ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before i will stay even contrary to your wishes and though you should persist to shun me i will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct miss hardcastle sir i must entreat youll desist as our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference i might have given an hour or two to levity but seriously mr marlow do you think i could ever submit to a connexion where i must appear mercenary and you imprudent do you think i could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer marlow kneeling does this look like security does this look like confidence no madam every moment that shows me your merit only serves to increase my diffidence and confusion here let me continue sir charles i can hold it no longer charles charles how hast thou deceived me is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation hardcastle your cold contempt your formal interview what have you to say now marlow that im all amazement what can it mean hardcastle it means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure that you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter marlow daughterthis lady your daughter hardcastle yes sir my only daughter my kate whose else should she be marlow oh the devil miss hardcastle yes sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for courtseying she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha marlow zounds theres no bearing this its worse than death miss hardcastle in which of your characters sir will you give us leave to address you as the faltering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with mrs mantrap and old miss biddy buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha marlow o curse on my noisy head i never attempted to be impudent yet that i was not taken down i must be gone hardcastle by the hand of my body but you shall not i see it was all a mistake and i am rejoiced to find it you shall not sir i tell you i know shell forgive you wont you forgive him kate well

could not have made a more prudent choice hardcastle then by the hand of my body im proud of the connexion mrs hardcastle well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss hardcastle sure dorothy you would not be so mercenary mrs hardcastle ay thats my affair not yours hardcastle but you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal mrs hardcastle ay but hes not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal enter hastings and miss neville mrs hardcastle aside what returned so soon i begin not to like it hastings to hardcastle for my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment we are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity by her fathers consent i first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty miss neville since his death i have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression in an hour of levity i was ready to give up my fortune to secure my choice but i am now recovered from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion mrs hardcastle pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel hardcastle be it what it will im glad theyre come back to reclaim their due come hither tony boy do you refuse this ladys hand whom i now offer you tony what signifies my refusing you know i cant refuse her till im of age father hardcastle while i thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement i concurred with your mothers desire to keep it secret but since i find she turns it to a wrong use i must now declare you have been of age these three months tony of age am i of age father hardcastle above three months tony then youll see the first use ill make of my liberty taking miss nevilles hand witness all men by these presents that i anthony lumpkin esquire of

he loves you and you must and shall have him hardcastle joining their hands and i say so too and mr marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter i dont believe youll ever repent your bargain so now to supper tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistaken in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife exeunt omnes\",\n          \"on a january evening of the early seventies christine nilsson was singing in faust at the academy of music in new york though there was already talk of the erection in remote metropolitan distances above the forties of a new opera house which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great european capitals the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old academy conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient and thus keeping out the new people whom new york was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations and the musical for its excellent acoustics always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music it was madame nilssons first appearance that winter and what the daily press had already learned to describe as an exceptionally brilliant audience had gathered to hear her transported through the slippery snowy streets in private broughams in the spacious family landau or in the humbler but more convenient brown coupe to come to the opera in a brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in ones own carriage and departure by the same means had the immense advantage of enabling one with a playful allusion to democratic principles to scramble into the first brown conveyance in the line instead of waiting till the coldandgin congested nose of ones own coachman gleamed under the portico of the academy it was one of the great liverystablemans most masterly intuitions to have discovered that americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it when newland archer opened the door at the back of the club box the curtain had just gone up on the garden scene there was no reason why the young man should not have come earlier for he had dined at seven alone with his mother and sister and had lingered afterward over a cigar in the gothic library with glazed blackwalnut bookcases and finialtopped chairs which was the only room in the house where mrs archer allowed smoking but in the first place new york was a metropolis and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was not the thing to arrive early at the opera and what was or was not the thing played a part as important in newland archers new york as the inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago the second reason for his delay was a personal one he had dawdled over his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante and thinking over a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its realisation this was especially the case when the pleasure was a delicate one as his pleasures mostly were and on this occasion the moment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality thatwell if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima donnas stagemanager he could not have entered the academy at a more significant moment than just as she was singing he loves mehe loves me nothe loves me and sprinkling the falling daisy petals with notes as clear as dew she sang of course mama and not he loves me since an unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the german text of french operas sung by swedish artists should be translated into italian for the clearer understanding of englishspeaking audiences this seemed as natural to newland archer as all the other conventions on which his life was moulded such as the duty of using two silverbacked brushes with his monogram in blue enamel to part his hair and of never appearing in society without a flower preferably a gardenia in his buttonhole mama non mama the prima donna sang and mama with a final burst of love triumphant as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to her lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of the little brown faustcapoul who was vainly trying in a tight purple velvet doublet and plumed cap to look as pure and true as his artless victim newland archer leaning against the wall at the back of the club box turned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the house directly facing him was the box of old mrs manson mingott whose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to attend the opera but who was always represented on fashionable nights by some of the younger members of the family on this occasion the front of the box was filled by her daughterinlaw mrs lovell mingott and her daughter mrs welland and slightly withdrawn behind these brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically fixed on the stagelovers as madame nilssons mama thrilled out above the silent house the boxes always stopped talking during the daisy song a warm pink mounted to the girls cheek mantled her brow to the roots of her fair braids and suffused the young slope of her breast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a single gardenia she dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of liliesofthevalley on her knee and newland archer saw her whitegloved fingertips touch the flowers softly he drew a breath of satisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage no expense had been spared on the setting which was acknowledged to be very beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the opera houses of paris and vienna the foreground to the footlights was covered with emerald green cloth in the middle distance symmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed the base of shrubs shaped like orangetrees but studded with large pink and red roses gigantic pansies considerably larger than the roses and closely resembling the floral penwipers made by female parishioners for fashionable clergymen sprang from the moss beneath the rosetrees and here and there a daisy grafted on a rosebranch flowered with a luxuriance prophetic of mr luther burbanks faroff prodigies in the centre of this enchanted garden madame nilsson in white cashmere slashed with pale blue satin a reticule dangling from a blue girdle and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her muslin chemisette listened with downcast eyes to m capouls impassioned wooing and affected a guileless incomprehension of his designs whenever by word or glance he persuasively indicated the ground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from the right wing the darling thought newland archer his glance flitting back to the young girl with the liliesofthevalley she doesnt even guess what its all about and he contemplated her absorbed young face with a thrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation was mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity well read faust together by the italian lakes he thought somewhat hazily confusing the scene of his projected honeymoon with the masterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to reveal to his bride it was only that afternoon that may welland had let him guess that she cared new yorks consecrated phrase of maiden avowal and already his imagination leaping ahead of the engagement ring the betrothal kiss and the march from lohengrin pictured her at his side in some scene of old european witchery he did not in the least wish the future mrs newland archer to be a simpleton he meant her thanks to his enlightening companionship to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the younger set in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it if he had probed to the bottom of his vanity as he sometimes nearly did he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as worldlywise and as eager to please as the married lady whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years without of course any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred that unhappy beings life and had disarranged his own plans for a whole winter how this miracle of fire and ice was to be created and to sustain itself in a harsh world he had never taken the time to think out but he was content to hold his view without analysing it since he knew it was that of all the carefullybrushed whitewaistcoated buttonholeflowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box exchanged friendly greetings with him and turned their operaglasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product of the system in matters intellectual and artistic newland archer felt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old new york gentility he had probably read more thought more and even seen a good deal more of the world than any other man of the number singly they betrayed their inferiority but grouped together they represented new york and the habit of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral he instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesomeand also rather bad formto strike out for himself wellupon my soul exclaimed lawrence lefferts turning his operaglass abruptly away from the stage lawrence lefferts was on the whole the foremost authority on form in new york he had probably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this intricate and fascinating question but study alone could not account for his complete and easy competence one had only to look at him from the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair moustache to the long patentleather feet at the other end of his lean and elegant person to feel that the knowledge of form must be congenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so carelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace as a young admirer had once said of him if anybody can tell a fellow just when to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to its larry lefferts and on the question of pumps versus patentleather oxfords his authority had never been disputed my god he said and silently handed his glass to old sillerton jackson newland archer following leffertss glance saw with surprise that his exclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old mrs mingotts box it was that of a slim young woman a little less tall than may welland with brown hair growing in close curls about her temples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds the suggestion of this headdress which gave her what was then called a josephine look was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather theatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large oldfashioned clasp the wearer of this unusual dress who seemed quite unconscious of the attention it was attracting stood a moment in the centre of the box discussing with mrs welland the propriety of taking the latters place in the front righthand corner then she yielded with a slight smile and seated herself in line with mrs wellands sisterinlaw mrs lovell mingott who was installed in the opposite corner mr sillerton jackson had returned the operaglass to lawrence lefferts the whole of the club turned instinctively waiting to hear what the old man had to say for old mr jackson was as great an authority on family as lawrence lefferts was on form he knew all the ramifications of new yorks cousinships and could not only elucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between the mingotts through the thorleys with the dallases of south carolina and that of the relationship of the elder branch of philadelphia thorleys to the albany chiverses on no account to be confused with the manson chiverses of university place but could also enumerate the leading characteristics of each family as for instance the fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of leffertses the long island ones or the fatal tendency of the rushworths to make foolish matches or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the albany chiverses with whom their new york cousins had always refused to intermarrywith the disastrous exception of poor medora manson who as everybody knew but then her mother was a rushworth in addition to this forest of family trees mr sillerton jackson carried between his narrow hollow temples and under his soft thatch of silver hair a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had smouldered under the unruffled surface of new york society within the last fifty years so far indeed did his information extend and so acutely retentive was his memory that he was supposed to be the only man who could have told you who julius beaufort the banker really was and what had become of handsome bob spicer old mrs manson mingotts father who had disappeared so mysteriously with a large sum of trust money less than a year after his marriage on the very day that a beautiful spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged audiences in the old operahouse on the battery had taken ship for cuba but these mysteries and many others were closely locked in mr jacksons breast for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his repeating anything privately imparted but he was fully aware that his reputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out what he wanted to know the club box therefore waited in visible suspense while mr sillerton jackson handed back lawrence leffertss operaglass for a moment he silently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes overhung by old veined lids then he gave his moustache a thoughtful twist and said simply i didnt think the mingotts would have tried it on newland archer during this brief episode had been thrown into a strange state of embarrassment it was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided attention of masculine new york should be that in which his betrothed was seated between her mother and aunt and for a moment he could not identify the lady in the empire dress nor imagine why her presence created such excitement among the initiated then light dawned on him and with it came a momentary rush of indignation no indeed no one would have thought the mingotts would have tried it on but they had they undoubtedly had for the lowtoned comments behind him left no doubt in archers mind that the young woman was may wellands cousin the cousin always referred to in the family as poor ellen olenska archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from europe a day or two previously he had even heard from miss welland not disapprovingly that she had been to see poor ellen who was staying with old mrs mingott archer entirely approved of family solidarity and one of the qualities he most admired in the mingotts was their resolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock had produced there was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young mans heart and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by false prudery from being kind in private to her unhappy cousin but to receive countess olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public at the opera of all places and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him newland archer was to be announced within a few weeks no he felt as old sillerton jackson felt he did not think the mingotts would have tried it on he knew of course that whatever man dared within fifth avenues limits that old mrs manson mingott the matriarch of the line would dare he had always admired the high and mighty old lady who in spite of having been only catherine spicer of staten island with a father mysteriously discredited and neither money nor position enough to make people forget it had allied herself with the head of the wealthy mingott line married two of her daughters to foreigners an italian marquis and an english banker and put the crowning touch to her audacities by building a large house of pale creamcoloured stone when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frockcoat in the afternoon in an inaccessible wilderness near the central park old mrs mingotts foreign daughters had become a legend they never came back to see their mother and the latter being like many persons of active mind and dominating will sedentary and corpulent in her habit had philosophically remained at home but the creamcoloured house supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the parisian aristocracy was there as a visible proof of her moral courage and she throned in it among prerevolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the tuileries of louis napoleon where she had shone in her middle age as placidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above thirtyfourth street or in having french windows that opened like doors instead of sashes that pushed up every one including mr sillerton jackson was agreed that old catherine had never had beautya gift which in the eyes of new york justified every success and excused a certain number of failings unkind people said that like her imperial namesake she had won her way to success by strength of will and hardness of heart and a kind of haughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency and dignity of her private life mr manson mingott had died when she was only twentyeight and had tied up the money with an additional caution born of the general distrust of the spicers but his bold young widow went her way fearlessly mingled freely in foreign society married her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable circles hobnobbed with dukes and ambassadors associated familiarly with papists entertained opera singers and was the intimate friend of mme taglioni and all the while as sillerton jackson was the first to proclaim there had never been a breath on her reputation the only respect he always added in which she differed from the earlier catherine mrs manson mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husbands fortune and had lived in affluence for half a century but memories of her early straits had made her excessively thrifty and though when she bought a dress or a piece of furniture she took care that it should be of the best she could not bring herself to spend much on the transient pleasures of the table therefore for totally different reasons her food was as poor as mrs archers and her wines did nothing to redeem it her relatives considered that the penury of her table discredited the mingott name which had always been associated with good living but people continued to come to her in spite of the made dishes and flat champagne and in reply to the remonstrances of her son lovell who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the best chef in new york she used to say laughingly whats the use of two good cooks in one family now that ive married the girls and cant eat sauces newland archer as he mused on these things had once more turned his eyes toward the mingott box he saw that mrs welland and her sisterinlaw were facing their semicircle of critics with the mingottian aplomb which old catherine had inculcated in all her tribe and that only may welland betrayed by a heightened colour perhaps due to the knowledge that he was watching her a sense of the gravity of the situation as for the cause of the commotion she sat gracefully in her corner of the box her eyes fixed on the stage and revealing as she leaned forward a little more shoulder and bosom than new york was accustomed to seeing at least in ladies who had reasons for wishing to pass unnoticed few things seemed to newland archer more awful than an offence against taste that faroff divinity of whom form was the mere visible representative and vicegerent madame olenskas pale and serious face appealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy situation but the way her dress which had no tucker sloped away from her thin shoulders shocked and troubled him he hated to think of may wellands being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless of the dictates of taste after all he heard one of the younger men begin behind him everybody talked through the mephistophelesandmartha scenes after all just what happened wellshe left him nobody attempts to deny that hes an awful brute isnt he continued the young enquirer a candid thorley who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the ladys champion the very worst i knew him at nice said lawrence lefferts with authority a halfparalysed white sneering fellowrather handsome head but eyes with a lot of lashes well ill tell you the sort when he wasnt with women he was collecting china paying any price for both i understand there was a general laugh and the young champion said well then well then she bolted with his secretary oh i see the champions face fell it didnt last long though i heard of her a few months later living alone in venice i believe lovell mingott went out to get her he said she was desperately unhappy thats all rightbut this parading her at the operas another thing perhaps young thorley hazarded shes too unhappy to be left at home this was greeted with an irreverent laugh and the youth blushed deeply and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowing people called a double entendre wellits queer to have brought miss welland anyhow some one said in a low tone with a sideglance at archer oh thats part of the campaign grannys orders no doubt lefferts laughed when the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly the act was ending and there was a general stir in the box suddenly newland archer felt himself impelled to decisive action the desire to be the first man to enter mrs mingotts box to proclaim to the waiting world his engagement to may welland and to see her through whatever difficulties her cousins anomalous situation might involve her in this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples and hesitations and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to the farther side of the house as he entered the box his eyes met miss wellands and he saw that she had instantly understood his motive though the family dignity which both considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so the persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications and pale delicacies and the fact that he and she understood each other without a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than any explanation would have done her eyes said you see why mamma brought me and his answered i would not for the world have had you stay away you know my niece countess olenska mrs welland enquired as she shook hands with her future soninlaw archer bowed without extending his hand as was the custom on being introduced to a lady and ellen olenska bent her head slightly keeping her own palegloved hands clasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers having greeted mrs lovell mingott a large blonde lady in creaking satin he sat down beside his betrothed and said in a low tone i hope youve told madame olenska that were engaged i want everybody to knowi want you to let me announce it this evening at the ball miss wellands face grew rosy as the dawn and she looked at him with radiant eyes if you can persuade mamma she said but why should we change what is already settled he made no answer but that which his eyes returned and she added still more confidently smiling tell my cousin yourself i give you leave she says she used to play with you when you were children she made way for him by pushing back her chair and promptly and a little ostentatiously with the desire that the whole house should see what he was doing archer seated himself at the countess olenskas side we did use to play together didnt we she asked turning her grave eyes to his you were a horrid boy and kissed me once behind a door but it was your cousin vandie newland who never looked at me that i was in love with her glance swept the horseshoe curve of boxes ah how this brings it all back to mei see everybody here in knickerbockers and pantalettes she said with her trailing slightly foreign accent her eyes returning to his face agreeable as their expression was the young man was shocked that they should reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal before which at that very moment her case was being tried nothing could be in worse taste than misplaced flippancy and he answered somewhat stiffly yes you have been away a very long time oh centuries and centuries so long she said that im sure im dead and buried and this dear old place is heaven which for reasons he could not define struck newland archer as an even more disrespectful way of describing new york society it invariably happened in the same way mrs julius beaufort on the night of her annual ball never failed to appear at the opera indeed she always gave her ball on an opera night in order to emphasise her complete superiority to household cares and her possession of a staff of servants competent to organise every detail of the entertainment in her absence the beauforts house was one of the few in new york that possessed a ballroom it antedated even mrs manson mingotts and the headly chiverses and at a time when it was beginning to be thought provincial to put a crash over the drawingroom floor and move the furniture upstairs the possession of a ballroom that was used for no other purpose and left for threehundredandsixtyfour days of the year to shuttered darkness with its gilt chairs stacked in a corner and its chandelier in a bag this undoubted superiority was felt to compensate for whatever was regrettable in the beaufort past mrs archer who was fond of coining her social philosophy into axioms had once said we all have our pet common people and though the phrase was a daring one its truth was secretly admitted in many an exclusive bosom but the beauforts were not exactly common some people said they were even worse mrs beaufort belonged indeed to one of americas most honoured families she had been the lovely regina dallas of the south carolina branch a penniless beauty introduced to new york society by her cousin the imprudent medora manson who was always doing the wrong thing from the right motive when one was related to the mansons and the rushworths one had a droit de cite as mr sillerton jackson who had frequented the tuileries called it in new york society but did one not forfeit it in marrying julius beaufort the question was who was beaufort he passed for an englishman was agreeable handsome illtempered hospitable and witty he had come to america with letters of recommendation from old mrs manson mingotts english soninlaw the banker and had speedily made himself an important position in the world of affairs but his habits were dissipated his tongue was bitter his antecedents were mysterious and when medora manson announced her cousins engagement to him it was felt to be one more act of folly in poor medoras long record of imprudences but folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom and two years after young mrs beauforts marriage it was admitted that she had the most distinguished house in new york no one knew exactly how the miracle was accomplished she was indolent passive the caustic even called her dull but dressed like an idol hung with pearls growing younger and blonder and more beautiful each year she throned in mr beauforts heavy brownstone palace and drew all the world there without lifting her jewelled little finger the knowing people said it was beaufort himself who trained the servants taught the chef new dishes told the gardeners what hothouse flowers to grow for the dinnertable and the drawingrooms selected the guests brewed the afterdinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her friends if he did these domestic activities were privately performed and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawingroom with the detachment of an invited guest and saying my wifes gloxinias are a marvel arent they i believe she gets them out from kew mr beauforts secret people were agreed was the way he carried things off it was all very well to whisper that he had been helped to leave england by the international bankinghouse in which he had been employed he carried off that rumour as easily as the restthough new yorks business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral standardhe carried everything before him and all new york into his drawingrooms and for over twenty years now people had said they were going to the beauforts with the same tone of security as if they had said they were going to mrs manson mingotts and with the added satisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvasback ducks and vintage wines instead of tepid veuve clicquot without a year and warmedup croquettes from philadelphia mrs beaufort then had as usual appeared in her box just before the jewel song and when again as usual she rose at the end of the third act drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders and disappeared new york knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin the beaufort house was one that new yorkers were proud to show to foreigners especially on the night of the annual ball the beauforts had been among the first people in new york to own their own red velvet carpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen under their own awning instead of hiring it with the supper and the ballroom chairs they had also inaugurated the custom of letting the ladies take their cloaks off in the hall instead of shuffling up to the hostesss bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the gasburner beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all his wifes friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly coiffees when they left home then the house had been boldly planned with a ballroom so that instead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it as at the chiverses one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed drawingrooms the seagreen the crimson and the bouton dor seeing from afar the manycandled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry and beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and treeferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold bamboo newland archer as became a young man of his position strolled in somewhat late he had left his overcoat with the silkstockinged footmen the stockings were one of beauforts few fatuities had dawdled a while in the library hung with spanish leather and furnished with buhl and malachite where a few men were chatting and putting on their dancinggloves and had finally joined the line of guests whom mrs beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson drawingroom archer was distinctly nervous he had not gone back to his club after the opera as the young bloods usually did but the night being fine had walked for some distance up fifth avenue before turning back in the direction of the beauforts house he was definitely afraid that the mingotts might be going too far that in fact they might have granny mingotts orders to bring the countess olenska to the ball from the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that would be and though he was more than ever determined to see the thing through he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his betrotheds cousin than before their brief talk at the opera wandering on to the bouton dor drawingroom where beaufort had had the audacity to hang love victorious the muchdiscussed nude of bouguereau archer found mrs welland and her daughter standing near the ballroom door couples were already gliding over the floor beyond the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts on girlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms on the dashing aigrettes and ornaments of the young married womens coiffures and on the glitter of highly glazed shirtfronts and fresh glace gloves miss welland evidently about to join the dancers hung on the threshold her liliesofthevalley in her hand she carried no other bouquet her face a little pale her eyes burning with a candid excitement a group of young men and girls were gathered about her and there was much handclasping laughing and pleasantry on which mrs welland standing slightly apart shed the beam of a qualified approval it was evident that miss welland was in the act of announcing her engagement while her mother affected the air of parental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion archer paused a moment it was at his express wish that the announcement had been made and yet it was not thus that he would have wished to have his happiness known to proclaim it in the heat and noise of a crowded ballroom was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy which should belong to things nearest the heart his joy was so deep that this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched but he would have liked to keep the surface pure too it was something of a satisfaction to find that may welland shared this feeling her eyes fled to his beseechingly and their look said remember were doing this because its right no appeal could have found a more immediate response in archers breast but he wished that the necessity of their action had been represented by some ideal reason and not simply by poor ellen olenska the group about miss welland made way for him with significant smiles and after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed into the middle of the ballroom floor and put his arm about her waist now we shant have to talk he said smiling into her candid eyes as they floated away on the soft waves of the blue danube she made no answer her lips trembled into a smile but the eyes remained distant and serious as if bent on some ineffable vision dear archer whispered pressing her to him it was borne in on him that the first hours of being engaged even if spent in a ballroom had in them something grave and sacramental what a new life it was going to be with this whiteness radiance goodness at ones side the dance over the two as became an affianced couple wandered into the conservatory and sitting behind a tall screen of treeferns and camellias newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips you see i did as you asked me to she said yes i couldnt wait he answered smiling after a moment he added only i wish it hadnt had to be at a ball yes i know she met his glance comprehendingly but after alleven here were alone together arent we oh dearestalways archer cried evidently she was always going to understand she was always going to say the right thing the discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow and he went on gaily the worst of it is that i want to kiss you and i cant as he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory assured himself of their momentary privacy and catching her to him laid a fugitive pressure on her lips to counteract the audacity of this proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of the conservatory and sitting down beside her broke a lilyofthevalley from her bouquet she sat silent and the world lay like a sunlit valley at their feet did you tell my cousin ellen she asked presently as if she spoke through a dream he roused himself and remembered that he had not done so some invincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign woman had checked the words on his lips noi hadnt the chance after all he said fibbing hastily ah she looked disappointed but gently resolved on gaining her point you must then for i didnt either and i shouldnt like her to think of course not but arent you after all the person to do it she pondered on this if id done it at the right time yes but now that theres been a delay i think you must explain that id asked you to tell her at the opera before our speaking about it to everybody here otherwise she might think i had forgotten her you see shes one of the family and shes been away so long that shes rathersensitive archer looked at her glowingly dear and great angel of course ill tell her he glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded ballroom but i havent seen her yet has she come no at the last minute she decided not to at the last minute he echoed betraying his surprise that she should ever have considered the alternative possible yes shes awfully fond of dancing the young girl answered simply but suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasnt smart enough for a ball though we thought it so lovely and so my aunt had to take her home oh well said archer with happy indifference nothing about his betrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to its utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the unpleasant in which they had both been brought up she knows as well as i do he reflected the real reason of her cousins staying away but i shall never let her see by the least sign that i am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor ellen olenskas reputation in the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits were exchanged the new york ritual was precise and inflexible in such matters and in conformity with it newland archer first went with his mother and sister to call on mrs welland after which he and mrs welland and may drove out to old mrs manson mingotts to receive that venerable ancestresss blessing a visit to mrs manson mingott was always an amusing episode to the young man the house in itself was already an historic document though not of course as venerable as certain other old family houses in university place and lower fifth avenue those were of the purest 1830 with a grim harmony of cabbagerosegarlanded carpets rosewood consoles roundarched fireplaces with black marble mantels and immense glazed bookcases of mahogany whereas old mrs mingott who had built her house later had bodily cast out the massive furniture of her prime and mingled with the mingott heirlooms the frivolous upholstery of the second empire it was her habit to sit in a window of her sittingroom on the ground floor as if watching calmly for life and fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors she seemed in no hurry to have them come for her patience was equalled by her confidence she was sure that presently the hoardings the quarries the onestory saloons the wooden greenhouses in ragged gardens and the rocks from which goats surveyed the scene would vanish before the advance of residences as stately as her ownperhaps for she was an impartial woman even statelier and that the cobblestones over which the old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth asphalt such as people reported having seen in paris meanwhile as every one she cared to see came to her and she could fill her rooms as easily as the beauforts and without adding a single item to the menu of her suppers she did not suffer from her geographic isolation the immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle life like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump active little woman with a neatlyturned foot and ankle into something as vast and august as a natural phenomenon she had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials and now in extreme old age was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh in the centre of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation a flight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a stillsnowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a miniature portrait of the late mr mingott and around and below wave after wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious armchair with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of the billows the burden of mrs manson mingotts flesh had long since made it impossible for her to go up and down stairs and with characteristic independence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established herself in flagrant violation of all the new york proprieties on the ground floor of her house so that as you sat in her sittingroom window with her you caught through a door that was always open and a loopedback yellow damask portiere the unexpected vista of a bedroom with a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa and a toilettable with frivolous lace flounces and a giltframed mirror her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this arrangement which recalled scenes in french fiction and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple american had never dreamed of that was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies in apartments with all the rooms on one floor and all the indecent propinquities that their novels described it amused newland archer who had secretly situated the lovescenes of monsieur de camors in mrs mingotts bedroom to picture her blameless life led in the stagesetting of adultery but he said to himself with considerable admiration that if a lover had been what she wanted the intrepid woman would have had him too to the general relief the countess olenska was not present in her grandmothers drawingroom during the visit of the betrothed couple mrs mingott said she had gone out which on a day of such glaring sunlight and at the shopping hour seemed in itself an indelicate thing for a compromised woman to do but at any rate it spared them the embarrassment of her presence and the faint shadow that her unhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future the visit went off successfully as was to have been expected old mrs mingott was delighted with the engagement which being long foreseen by watchful relatives had been carefully passed upon in family council and the engagement ring a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws met with her unqualified admiration its the new setting of course it shows the stone beautifully but it looks a little bare to oldfashioned eyes mrs welland had explained with a conciliatory sideglance at her future soninlaw oldfashioned eyes i hope you dont mean mine my dear i like all the novelties said the ancestress lifting the stone to her small bright orbs which no glasses had ever disfigured very handsome she added returning the jewel very liberal in my time a cameo set in pearls was thought sufficient but its the hand that sets off the ring isnt it my dear mr archer and she waved one of her tiny hands with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the wrist like ivory bracelets mine was modelled in rome by the great ferrigiani you should have mays done no doubt hell have it done my child her hand is largeits these modern sports that spread the jointsbut the skin is whiteand whens the wedding to be she broke off fixing her eyes on archers face oh mrs welland murmured while the young man smiling at his betrothed replied as soon as ever it can if only youll back me up mrs mingott we must give them time to get to know each other a little better mamma mrs welland interposed with the proper affectation of reluctance to which the ancestress rejoined know each other fiddlesticks everybody in new york has always known everybody let the young man have his way my dear dont wait till the bubbles off the wine marry them before lent i may catch pneumonia any winter now and i want to give the weddingbreakfast these successive statements were received with the proper expressions of amusement incredulity and gratitude and the visit was breaking up in a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the countess olenska who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected figure of julius beaufort there was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies and mrs mingott held out ferrigianis model to the banker ha beaufort this is a rare favour she had an odd foreign way of addressing men by their surnames thanks i wish it might happen oftener said the visitor in his easy arrogant way im generally so tied down but i met the countess ellen in madison square and she was good enough to let me walk home with her ahi hope the house will be gayer now that ellens here cried mrs mingott with a glorious effrontery sit downsit down beaufort push up the yellow armchair now ive got you i want a good gossip i hear your ball was magnificent and i understand you invited mrs lemuel struthers wellive a curiosity to see the woman myself she had forgotten her relatives who were drifting out into the hall under ellen olenskas guidance old mrs mingott had always professed a great admiration for julius beaufort and there was a kind of kinship in their cool domineering way and their shortcuts through the conventions now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the beauforts to invite for the first time mrs lemuel struthers the widow of strutherss shoepolish who had returned the previous year from a long initiatory sojourn in europe to lay siege to the tight little citadel of new york of course if you and regina invite her the thing is settled well we need new blood and new moneyand i hear shes still very goodlooking the carnivorous old lady declared in the hall while mrs welland and may drew on their furs archer saw that the countess olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning smile of course you know alreadyabout may and me he said answering her look with a shy laugh she scolded me for not giving you the news last night at the opera i had her orders to tell you that we were engagedbut i couldnt in that crowd the smile passed from countess olenskas eyes to her lips she looked younger more like the bold brown ellen mingott of his boyhood of course i know yes and im so glad but one doesnt tell such things first in a crowd the ladies were on the threshold and she held out her hand goodbye come and see me some day she said still looking at archer in the carriage on the way down fifth avenue they talked pointedly of mrs mingott of her age her spirit and all her wonderful attributes no one alluded to ellen olenska but archer knew that mrs welland was thinking its a mistake for ellen to be seen the very day after her arrival parading up fifth avenue at the crowded hour with julius beaufort and the young man himself mentally added and she ought to know that a man whos just engaged doesnt spend his time calling on married women but i daresay in the set shes lived in they dothey never do anything else and in spite of the cosmopolitan views on which he prided himself he thanked heaven that he was a new yorker and about to ally himself with one of his own kind the next evening old mr sillerton jackson came to dine with the archers mrs archer was a shy woman and shrank from society but she liked to be wellinformed as to its doings her old friend mr sillerton jackson applied to the investigation of his friends affairs the patience of a collector and the science of a naturalist and his sister miss sophy jackson who lived with him and was entertained by all the people who could not secure her muchsoughtafter brother brought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in his picture therefore whenever anything happened that mrs archer wanted to know about she asked mr jackson to dine and as she honoured few people with her invitations and as she and her daughter janey were an excellent audience mr jackson usually came himself instead of sending his sister if he could have dictated all the conditions he would have chosen the evenings when newland was out not because the young man was uncongenial to him the two got on capitally at their club but because the old anecdotist sometimes felt on newlands part a tendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never showed mr jackson if perfection had been attainable on earth would also have asked that mrs archers food should be a little better but then new york as far back as the mind of man could travel had been divided into the two great fundamental groups of the mingotts and mansons and all their clan who cared about eating and clothes and money and the archernewlandvanderluyden tribe who were devoted to travel horticulture and the best fiction and looked down on the grosser forms of pleasure you couldnt have everything after all if you dined with the lovell mingotts you got canvasback and terrapin and vintage wines at adeline archers you could talk about alpine scenery and the marble faun and luckily the archer madeira had gone round the cape therefore when a friendly summons came from mrs archer mr jackson who was a true eclectic would usually say to his sister ive been a little gouty since my last dinner at the lovell mingottsit will do me good to diet at adelines mrs archer who had long been a widow lived with her son and daughter in west twentyeighth street an upper floor was dedicated to newland and the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below in an unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in wardian cases made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen collected american revolutionary glazed ware subscribed to good words and read ouidas novels for the sake of the italian atmosphere they preferred those about peasant life because of the descriptions of scenery and the pleasanter sentiments though in general they liked novels about people in society whose motives and habits were more comprehensible spoke severely of dickens who had never drawn a gentleman and considered thackeray less at home in the great world than bulwerwho however was beginning to be thought oldfashioned mrs and miss archer were both great lovers of scenery it was what they principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad considering architecture and painting as subjects for men and chiefly for learned persons who read ruskin mrs archer had been born a newland and mother and daughter who were as like as sisters were both as people said true newlands tall pale and slightly roundshouldered with long noses sweet smiles and a kind of drooping distinction like that in certain faded reynolds portraits their physical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint had not stretched mrs archers black brocade while miss archers brown and purple poplins hung as the years went on more and more slackly on her virgin frame mentally the likeness between them as newland was aware was less complete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear the long habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given them the same vocabulary and the same habit of beginning their phrases mother thinks or janey thinks according as one or the other wished to advance an opinion of her own but in reality while mrs archers serene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar janey was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from springs of suppressed romance mother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and brother and archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and uncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration and by his secret satisfaction in it after all he thought it a good thing for a man to have his authority respected in his own house even if his sense of humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate on this occasion the young man was very sure that mr jackson would rather have had him dine out but he had his own reasons for not doing so of course old jackson wanted to talk about ellen olenska and of course mrs archer and janey wanted to hear what he had to tell all three would be slightly embarrassed by newlands presence now that his prospective relation to the mingott clan had been made known and the young man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn the difficulty they began obliquely by talking about mrs lemuel struthers its a pity the beauforts asked her mrs archer said gently but then regina always does what he tells her and beaufort certain nuances escape beaufort said mr jackson cautiously inspecting the broiled shad and wondering for the thousandth time why mrs archers cook always burnt the roe to a cinder newland who had long shared his wonder could always detect it in the older mans expression of melancholy disapproval oh necessarily beaufort is a vulgar man said mrs archer my grandfather newland always used to say to my mother whatever you do dont let that fellow beaufort be introduced to the girls but at least hes had the advantage of associating with gentlemen in england too they say its all very mysterious she glanced at janey and paused she and janey knew every fold of the beaufort mystery but in public mrs archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for the unmarried but this mrs struthers mrs archer continued what did you say she was sillerton out of a mine or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit then with living waxworks touring new england after the police broke that up they say she lived mr jackson in his turn glanced at janey whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids there were still hiatuses for her in mrs strutherss past then mr jackson continued and archer saw he was wondering why no one had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife then lemuel struthers came along they say his advertiser used the girls head for the shoepolish posters her hairs intensely black you knowthe egyptian style anyhow heeventuallymarried her there were volumes of innuendo in the way the eventually was spaced and each syllable given its due stress oh wellat the pass weve come to nowadays it doesnt matter said mrs archer indifferently the ladies were not really interested in mrs struthers just then the subject of ellen olenska was too fresh and too absorbing to them indeed mrs strutherss name had been introduced by mrs archer only that she might presently be able to say and newlands new cousincountess olenska was she at the ball too there was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son and archer knew it and had expected it even mrs archer who was seldom unduly pleased with human events had been altogether glad of her sons engagement especially after that silly business with mrs rushworth as she had remarked to janey alluding to what had once seemed to newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the scar there was no better match in new york than may welland look at the question from whatever point you chose of course such a marriage was only what newland was entitled to but young men are so foolish and incalculableand some women so ensnaring and unscrupulousthat it was nothing short of a miracle to see ones only son safe past the siren isle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity all this mrs archer felt and her son knew she felt but he knew also that she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his engagement or rather by its cause and it was for that reasonbecause on the whole he was a tender and indulgent masterthat he had stayed at home that evening its not that i dont approve of the mingotts esprit de corps but why newlands engagement should be mixed up with that olenska womans comings and goings i dont see mrs archer grumbled to janey the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect sweetness she had behaved beautifullyand in beautiful behaviour she was unsurpassedduring the call on mrs welland but newland knew and his betrothed doubtless guessed that all through the visit she and janey were nervously on the watch for madame olenskas possible intrusion and when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say to her son im thankful that augusta welland received us alone these indications of inward disturbance moved archer the more that he too felt that the mingotts had gone a little too far but as it was against all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts he simply replied oh well theres always a phase of family parties to be gone through when one gets engaged and the sooner its over the better at which his mother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from her grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes her revenge he felther lawful revengewould be to draw mr jackson that evening on the countess olenska and having publicly done his duty as a future member of the mingott clan the young man had no objection to hearing the lady discussed in privateexcept that the subject was already beginning to bore him mr jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the mournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own and had rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff he looked baffled and hungry and archer reflected that he would probably finish his meal on ellen olenska mr jackson leaned back in his chair and glanced up at the candlelit archers newlands and van der luydens hanging in dark frames on the dark walls ah how your grandfather archer loved a good dinner my dear newland he said his eyes on the portrait of a plump fullchested young man in a stock and a blue coat with a view of a whitecolumned countryhouse behind him wellwellwell i wonder what he would have said to all these foreign marriages mrs archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and mr jackson continued with deliberation no she was not at the ball ah mrs archer murmured in a tone that implied she had that decency perhaps the beauforts dont know her janey suggested with her artless malice mr jackson gave a faint sip as if he had been tasting invisible madeira mrs beaufort may notbut beaufort certainly does for she was seen walking up fifth avenue this afternoon with him by the whole of new york mercy moaned mrs archer evidently perceiving the uselessness of trying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy i wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon janey speculated at the opera i know she had on dark blue velvet perfectly plain and flatlike a nightgown janey said her mother and miss archer blushed and tried to look audacious it was at any rate in better taste not to go to the ball mrs archer continued a spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin i dont think it was a question of taste with her may said she meant to go and then decided that the dress in question wasnt smart enough mrs archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference poor ellen she simply remarked adding compassionately we must always bear in mind what an eccentric bringingup medora manson gave her what can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her comingout ball ahdont i remember her in it said mr jackson adding poor girl in the tone of one who while enjoying the memory had fully understood at the time what the sight portended its odd janey remarked that she should have kept such an ugly name as ellen i should have changed it to elaine she glanced about the table to see the effect of this her brother laughed why elaine i dont know it sounds moremore polish said janey blushing it sounds more conspicuous and that can hardly be what she wishes said mrs archer distantly why not broke in her son growing suddenly argumentative why shouldnt she be conspicuous if she chooses why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself shes poor ellen certainly because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage but i dont see that thats a reason for hiding her head as if she were the culprit that i suppose said mr jackson speculatively is the line the mingotts mean to take the young man reddened i didnt have to wait for their cue if thats what you mean sir madame olenska has had an unhappy life that doesnt make her an outcast there are rumours began mr jackson glancing at janey oh i know the secretary the young man took him up nonsense mother janeys grownup they say dont they he went on that the secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband who kept her practically a prisoner well what if he did i hope there isnt a man among us who wouldnt have done the same in such a case mr jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler perhaps that sauce just a little after all then having helped himself he remarked im told shes looking for a house she means to live here i hear she means to get a divorce said janey boldly i hope she will archer exclaimed the word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil atmosphere of the archer diningroom mrs archer raised her delicate eyebrows in the particular curve that signified the butler and the young man himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such intimate matters in public hastily branched off into an account of his visit to old mrs mingott after dinner according to immemorial custom mrs archer and janey trailed their long silk draperies up to the drawingroom where while the gentlemen smoked below stairs they sat beside a carcel lamp with an engraved globe facing each other across a rosewood worktable with a green silk bag under it and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry band of fieldflowers destined to adorn an occasional chair in the drawingroom of young mrs newland archer while this rite was in progress in the drawingroom archer settled mr jackson in an armchair near the fire in the gothic library and handed him a cigar mr jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction lit his cigar with perfect confidence it was newland who bought them and stretching his thin old ankles to the coals said you say the secretary merely helped her to get away my dear fellow well he was still helping her a year later then for somebody met em living at lausanne together newland reddened living together well why not who had the right to make her life over if she hadnt im sick of the hypocrisy that would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with harlots he stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar women ought to be freeas free as we are he declared making a discovery of which he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences mr sillerton jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted a sardonic whistle well he said after a pause apparently count olenski takes your view for i never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife back that evening after mr jackson had taken himself away and the ladies had retired to their chintzcurtained bedroom newland archer mounted thoughtfully to his own study a vigilant hand had as usual kept the fire alive and the lamp trimmed and the room with its rows and rows of books its bronze and steel statuettes of the fencers on the mantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures looked singularly homelike and welcoming as he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a large photograph of may welland which the young girl had given him in the first days of their romance and which had now displaced all the other portraits on the table with a new sense of awe he looked at the frank forehead serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young creature whose souls custodian he was to be that terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything looked back at him like a stranger through may wellands familiar features and once more it was borne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been taught to think but a voyage on uncharted seas the case of the countess olenska had stirred up old settled convictions and set them drifting dangerously through his mind his own exclamation women should be freeas free as we are struck to the root of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as nonexistent nice women however wronged would never claim the kind of freedom he meant and generousminded men like himself were thereforein the heat of argumentthe more chivalrously ready to concede it to them such verbal generosities were in fact only a humbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things together and bound people down to the old pattern but here he was pledged to defend on the part of his betrotheds cousin conduct that on his own wifes part would justify him in calling down on her all the thunders of church and state of course the dilemma was purely hypothetical since he wasnt a blackguard polish nobleman it was absurd to speculate what his wifes rights would be if he were but newland archer was too imaginative not to feel that in his case and mays the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable what could he and she really know of each other since it was his duty as a decent fellow to conceal his past from her and hers as a marriageable girl to have no past to conceal what if for some one of the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them they should tire of each other misunderstand or irritate each other he reviewed his friends marriagesthe supposedly happy onesand saw none that answered even remotely to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with may welland he perceived that such a picture presupposed on her part the experience the versatility the freedom of judgment which she had been carefully trained not to possess and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other lawrence lefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely realised this enviable ideal as became the highpriest of form he had formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that in the most conspicuous moments of his frequent loveaffairs with other mens wives she went about in smiling unconsciousness saying that lawrence was so frightfully strict and had been known to blush indignantly and avert her gaze when some one alluded in her presence to the fact that julius beaufort as became a foreigner of doubtful origin had what was known in new york as another establishment archer tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite such an ass as larry lefferts nor may such a simpleton as poor gertrude but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not of standards in reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world where the real thing was never said or done or even thought but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs as when mrs welland who knew exactly why archer had pressed her to announce her daughters engagement at the beaufort ball and had indeed expected him to do no less yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance and the air of having had her hand forced quite as in the books on primitive man that people of advanced culture were beginning to read the savage bride is dragged with shrieks from her parents tent the result of course was that the young girl who was the centre of this elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable for her very frankness and assurance she was frank poor darling because she had nothing to conceal assured because she knew of nothing to be on her guard against and with no better preparation than this she was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called the facts of life the young man was sincerely but placidly in love he delighted in the radiant good looks of his betrothed in her health her horsemanship her grace and quickness at games and the shy interest in books and ideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance she had advanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the idyls of the king but not to feel the beauty of ulysses and the lotus eaters she was straightforward loyal and brave she had a sense of humour chiefly proved by her laughing at his jokes and he suspected in the depths of her innocentlygazing soul a glow of feeling that it would be a joy to waken but when he had gone the brief round of her he returned discouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were only an artificial product untrained human nature was not frank and innocent it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive guile and he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious purity so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts and grandmothers and longdead ancestresses because it was supposed to be what he wanted what he had a right to in order that he might exercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow there was a certain triteness in these reflections they were those habitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day but they were generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and selfabasement of which newland archer felt no trace he could not deplore as thackerays heroes so often exasperated him by doing that he had not a blank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she was to give to him he could not get away from the fact that if he had been brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find their way about than the babes in the wood nor could he for all his anxious cogitations see any honest reason any that is unconnected with his own momentary pleasure and the passion of masculine vanity why his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of experience as himself such questions at such an hour were bound to drift through his mind but he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision were due to the inopportune arrival of the countess olenska here he was at the very moment of his betrothala moment for pure thoughts and cloudless hopespitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised all the special problems he would have preferred to let lie hang ellen olenska he grumbled as he covered his fire and began to undress he could not really see why her fate should have the least bearing on his yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to measure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced upon him a few days later the bolt fell the lovell mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as a formal dinner that is three extra footmen two dishes for each course and a roman punch in the middle and had headed their invitations with the words to meet the countess olenska in accordance with the hospitable american fashion which treats strangers as if they were royalties or at least as their ambassadors the guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in which the initiated recognised the firm hand of catherine the great associated with such immemorial standbys as the selfridge merrys who were asked everywhere because they always had been the beauforts on whom there was a claim of relationship and mr sillerton jackson and his sister sophy who went wherever her brother told her to were some of the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant young married set the lawrence leffertses mrs lefferts rushworth the lovely widow the harry thorleys the reggie chiverses and young morris dagonet and his wife who was a van der luyden the company indeed was perfectly assorted since all the members belonged to the little inner group of people who during the long new york season disported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently undiminished zest fortyeight hours later the unbelievable had happened every one had refused the mingotts invitation except the beauforts and old mr jackson and his sister the intended slight was emphasised by the fact that even the reggie chiverses who were of the mingott clan were among those inflicting it and by the uniform wording of the notes in all of which the writers regretted that they were unable to accept without the mitigating plea of a previous engagement that ordinary courtesy prescribed new york society was in those days far too small and too scant in its resources for every one in it including liverystablekeepers butlers and cooks not to know exactly on which evenings people were free and it was thus possible for the recipients of mrs lovell mingotts invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to meet the countess olenska the blow was unexpected but the mingotts as their way was met it gallantly mrs lovell mingott confided the case to mrs welland who confided it to newland archer who aflame at the outrage appealed passionately and authoritatively to his mother who after a painful period of inward resistance and outward temporising succumbed to his instances as she always did and immediately embracing his cause with an energy redoubled by her previous hesitations put on her grey velvet bonnet and said ill go and see louisa van der luyden the new york of newland archers day was a small and slippery pyramid in which as yet hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained at its base was a firm foundation of what mrs archer called plain people an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who as in the case of the spicers or the leffertses or the jacksons had been raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans people mrs archer always said were not as particular as they used to be and with old catherine spicer ruling one end of fifth avenue and julius beaufort the other you couldnt expect the old traditions to last much longer firmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum was the compact and dominant group which the mingotts newlands chiverses and mansons so actively represented most people imagined them to be the very apex of the pyramid but they themselves at least those of mrs archers generation were aware that in the eyes of the professional genealogist only a still smaller number of families could lay claim to that eminence dont tell me mrs archer would say to her children all this modern newspaper rubbish about a new york aristocracy if there is one neither the mingotts nor the mansons belong to it no nor the newlands or the chiverses either our grandfathers and greatgrandfathers were just respectable english or dutch merchants who came to the colonies to make their fortune and stayed here because they did so well one of your greatgrandfathers signed the declaration and another was a general on washingtons staff and received general burgoynes sword after the battle of saratoga these are things to be proud of but they have nothing to do with rank or class new york has always been a commercial community and there are not more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin in the real sense of the word mrs archer and her son and daughter like every one else in new york knew who these privileged beings were the dagonets of washington square who came of an old english county family allied with the pitts and foxes the lannings who had intermarried with the descendants of count de grasse and the van der luydens direct descendants of the first dutch governor of manhattan and related by prerevolutionary marriages to several members of the french and british aristocracy the lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively miss lannings who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family portraits and chippendale the dagonets were a considerable clan allied to the best names in baltimore and philadelphia but the van der luydens who stood above all of them had faded into a kind of superterrestrial twilight from which only two figures impressively emerged those of mr and mrs henry van der luyden mrs henry van der luyden had been louisa dagonet and her mother had been the granddaughter of colonel du lac of an old channel island family who had fought under cornwallis and had settled in maryland after the war with his bride lady angelica trevenna fifth daughter of the earl of st austrey the tie between the dagonets the du lacs of maryland and their aristocratic cornish kinsfolk the trevennas had always remained close and cordial mr and mrs van der luyden had more than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of trevenna the duke of st austrey at his countryseat in cornwall and at st austrey in gloucestershire and his grace had frequently announced his intention of some day returning their visit without the duchess who feared the atlantic mr and mrs van der luyden divided their time between trevenna their place in maryland and skuytercliff the great estate on the hudson which had been one of the colonial grants of the dutch government to the famous first governor and of which mr van der luyden was still patroon their large solemn house in madison avenue was seldom opened and when they came to town they received in it only their most intimate friends i wish you would go with me newland his mother said suddenly pausing at the door of the brown coupe louisa is fond of you and of course its on account of dear may that im taking this stepand also because if we dont all stand together therell be no such thing as society left mrs henry van der luyden listened in silence to her cousin mrs archers narrative it was all very well to tell yourself in advance that mrs van der luyden was always silent and that though noncommittal by nature and training she was very kind to the people she really liked even personal experience of these facts was not always a protection from the chill that descended on one in the highceilinged whitewalled madison avenue drawingroom with the pale brocaded armchairs so obviously uncovered for the occasion and the gauze still veiling the ormolu mantel ornaments and the beautiful old carved frame of gainsboroughs lady angelica du lac mrs van der luydens portrait by huntington in black velvet and venetian point faced that of her lovely ancestress it was generally considered as fine as a cabanel and though twenty years had elapsed since its execution was still a perfect likeness indeed the mrs van der luyden who sat beneath it listening to mrs archer might have been the twinsister of the fair and still youngish woman drooping against a gilt armchair before a green rep curtain mrs van der luyden still wore black velvet and venetian point when she went into societyor rather since she never dined out when she threw open her own doors to receive it her fair hair which had faded without turning grey was still parted in flat overlapping points on her forehead and the straight nose that divided her pale blue eyes was only a little more pinched about the nostrils than when the portrait had been painted she always indeed struck newland archer as having been rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a perfectly irreproachable existence as bodies caught in glaciers keep for years a rosy lifeindeath like all his family he esteemed and admired mrs van der luyden but he found her gentle bending sweetness less approachable than the grimness of some of his mothers old aunts fierce spinsters who said no on principle before they knew what they were going to be asked mrs van der luydens attitude said neither yes nor no but always appeared to incline to clemency till her thin lips wavering into the shadow of a smile made the almost invariable reply i shall first have to talk this over with my husband she and mr van der luyden were so exactly alike that archer often wondered how after forty years of the closest conjugality two such merged identities ever separated themselves enough for anything as controversial as a talkingover but as neither had ever reached a decision without prefacing it by this mysterious conclave mrs archer and her son having set forth their case waited resignedly for the familiar phrase mrs van der luyden however who had seldom surprised any one now surprised them by reaching her long hand toward the bellrope i think she said i should like henry to hear what you have told me a footman appeared to whom she gravely added if mr van der luyden has finished reading the newspaper please ask him to be kind enough to come she said reading the newspaper in the tone in which a ministers wife might have said presiding at a cabinet meetingnot from any arrogance of mind but because the habit of a lifetime and the attitude of her friends and relations had led her to consider mr van der luydens least gesture as having an almost sacerdotal importance her promptness of action showed that she considered the case as pressing as mrs archer but lest she should be thought to have committed herself in advance she added with the sweetest look henry always enjoys seeing you dear adeline and he will wish to congratulate newland the double doors had solemnly reopened and between them appeared mr henry van der luyden tall spare and frockcoated with faded fair hair a straight nose like his wifes and the same look of frozen gentleness in eyes that were merely pale grey instead of pale blue mr van der luyden greeted mrs archer with cousinly affability proffered to newland lowvoiced congratulations couched in the same language as his wifes and seated himself in one of the brocade armchairs with the simplicity of a reigning sovereign i had just finished reading the times he said laying his long fingertips together in town my mornings are so much occupied that i find it more convenient to read the newspapers after luncheon ah theres a great deal to be said for that planindeed i think my uncle egmont used to say he found it less agitating not to read the morning papers till after dinner said mrs archer responsively yes my good father abhorred hurry but now we live in a constant rush said mr van der luyden in measured tones looking with pleasant deliberation about the large shrouded room which to archer was so complete an image of its owners but i hope you had finished your reading henry his wife interposed quitequite he reassured her then i should like adeline to tell you oh its really newlands story said his mother smiling and proceeded to rehearse once more the monstrous tale of the affront inflicted on mrs lovell mingott of course she ended augusta welland and mary mingott both felt that especially in view of newlands engagement you and henry ought to know ah said mr van der luyden drawing a deep breath there was a silence during which the tick of the monumental ormolu clock on the white marble mantelpiece grew as loud as the boom of a minutegun archer contemplated with awe the two slender faded figures seated side by side in a kind of viceregal rigidity mouthpieces of some remote ancestral authority which fate compelled them to wield when they would so much rather have lived in simplicity and seclusion digging invisible weeds out of the perfect lawns of skuytercliff and playing patience together in the evenings mr van der luyden was the first to speak you really think this is due to somesome intentional interference of lawrence leffertss he enquired turning to archer im certain of it sir larry has been going it rather harder than usual latelyif cousin louisa wont mind my mentioning ithaving rather a stiff affair with the postmasters wife in their village or some one of that sort and whenever poor gertrude lefferts begins to suspect anything and hes afraid of trouble he gets up a fuss of this kind to show how awfully moral he is and talks at the top of his voice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he doesnt wish her to know hes simply using madame olenska as a lightningrod ive seen him try the same thing often before the leffertses said mrs van der luyden the leffertses echoed mrs archer what would uncle egmont have said of lawrence leffertss pronouncing on anybodys social position it shows what society has come to well hope it has not quite come to that said mr van der luyden firmly ah if only you and louisa went out more sighed mrs archer but instantly she became aware of her mistake the van der luydens were morbidly sensitive to any criticism of their secluded existence they were the arbiters of fashion the court of last appeal and they knew it and bowed to their fate but being shy and retiring persons with no natural inclination for their part they lived as much as possible in the sylvan solitude of skuytercliff and when they came to town declined all invitations on the plea of mrs van der luydens health newland archer came to his mothers rescue everybody in new york knows what you and cousin louisa represent thats why mrs mingott felt she ought not to allow this slight on countess olenska to pass without consulting you mrs van der luyden glanced at her husband who glanced back at her it is the principle that i dislike said mr van der luyden as long as a member of a wellknown family is backed up by that family it should be consideredfinal it seems so to me said his wife as if she were producing a new thought i had no idea mr van der luyden continued that things had come to such a pass he paused and looked at his wife again it occurs to me my dear that the countess olenska is already a sort of relationthrough medora mansons first husband at any rate she will be when newland marries he turned toward the young man have you read this mornings times newland why yes sir said archer who usually tossed off half a dozen papers with his morning coffee husband and wife looked at each other again their pale eyes clung together in prolonged and serious consultation then a faint smile fluttered over mrs van der luydens face she had evidently guessed and approved mr van der luyden turned to mrs archer if louisas health allowed her to dine outi wish you would say to mrs lovell mingottshe and i would have been happy toerfill the places of the lawrence leffertses at her dinner he paused to let the irony of this sink in as you know this is impossible mrs archer sounded a sympathetic assent but newland tells me he has read this mornings times therefore he has probably seen that louisas relative the duke of st austrey arrives next week on the russia he is coming to enter his new sloop the guinevere in next summers international cup race and also to have a little canvasback shooting at trevenna mr van der luyden paused again and continued with increasing benevolence before taking him down to maryland we are inviting a few friends to meet him hereonly a little dinnerwith a reception afterward i am sure louisa will be as glad as i am if countess olenska will let us include her among our guests he got up bent his long body with a stiff friendliness toward his cousin and added i think i have louisas authority for saying that she will herself leave the invitation to dine when she drives out presently with our cardsof course with our cards mrs archer who knew this to be a hint that the seventeenhand chestnuts which were never kept waiting were at the door rose with a hurried murmur of thanks mrs van der luyden beamed on her with the smile of esther interceding with ahasuerus but her husband raised a protesting hand there is nothing to thank me for dear adeline nothing whatever this kind of thing must not happen in new york it shall not as long as i can help it he pronounced with sovereign gentleness as he steered his cousins to the door two hours later every one knew that the great cspring barouche in which mrs van der luyden took the air at all seasons had been seen at old mrs mingotts door where a large square envelope was handed in and that evening at the opera mr sillerton jackson was able to state that the envelope contained a card inviting the countess olenska to the dinner which the van der luydens were giving the following week for their cousin the duke of st austrey some of the younger men in the club box exchanged a smile at this announcement and glanced sideways at lawrence lefferts who sat carelessly in the front of the box pulling his long fair moustache and who remarked with authority as the soprano paused no one but patti ought to attempt the sonnambula it was generally agreed in new york that the countess olenska had lost her looks she had appeared there first in newland archers boyhood as a brilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten of whom people said that she ought to be painted her parents had been continental wanderers and after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both and been taken in charge by her aunt medora manson also a wanderer who was herself returning to new york to settle down poor medora repeatedly widowed was always coming home to settle down each time in a less expensive house and bringing with her a new husband or an adopted child but after a few months she invariably parted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward and having got rid of her house at a loss set out again on her wanderings as her mother had been a rushworth and her last unhappy marriage had linked her to one of the crazy chiverses new york looked indulgently on her eccentricities but when she returned with her little orphaned niece whose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for travel people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in such hands every one was disposed to be kind to little ellen mingott though her dusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed unsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her parents it was one of the misguided medoras many peculiarities to flout the unalterable rules that regulated american mourning and when she stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that the crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter than those of her sistersinlaw while little ellen was in crimson merino and amber beads like a gipsy foundling but new york had so long resigned itself to medora that only a few old ladies shook their heads over ellens gaudy clothes while her other relations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits she was a fearless and familiar little thing who asked disconcerting questions made precocious comments and possessed outlandish arts such as dancing a spanish shawl dance and singing neapolitan lovesongs to a guitar under the direction of her aunt whose real name was mrs thorley chivers but who having received a papal title had resumed her first husbands patronymic and called herself the marchioness manson because in italy she could turn it into manzoni the little girl received an expensive but incoherent education which included drawing from the model a thing never dreamed of before and playing the piano in quintets with professional musicians of course no good could come of this and when a few years later poor chivers finally died in a madhouse his widow draped in strange weeds again pulled up stakes and departed with ellen who had grown into a tall bony girl with conspicuous eyes for some time no more was heard of them then news came of ellens marriage to an immensely rich polish nobleman of legendary fame whom she had met at a ball at the tuileries and who was said to have princely establishments in paris nice and florence a yacht at cowes and many square miles of shooting in transylvania she disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis and when a few years later medora again came back to new york subdued impoverished mourning a third husband and in quest of a still smaller house people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do something for her then came the news that ellens own marriage had ended in disaster and that she was herself returning home to seek rest and oblivion among her kinsfolk these things passed through newland archers mind a week later as he watched the countess olenska enter the van der luyden drawingroom on the evening of the momentous dinner the occasion was a solemn one and he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off she came rather late one hand still ungloved and fastening a bracelet about her wrist yet she entered without any appearance of haste or embarrassment the drawingroom in which new yorks most chosen company was somewhat awfully assembled in the middle of the room she paused looking about her with a grave mouth and smiling eyes and in that instant newland archer rejected the general verdict on her looks it was true that her early radiance was gone the red cheeks had paled she was thin worn a little olderlooking than her age which must have been nearly thirty but there was about her the mysterious authority of beauty a sureness in the carriage of the head the movement of the eyes which without being in the least theatrical struck his as highly trained and full of a conscious power at the same time she was simpler in manner than most of the ladies present and many people as he heard afterward from janey were disappointed that her appearance was not more stylishfor stylishness was what new york most valued it was perhaps archer reflected because her early vivacity had disappeared because she was so quietquiet in her movements her voice and the tones of her lowpitched voice new york had expected something a good deal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history the dinner was a somewhat formidable business dining with the van der luydens was at best no light matter and dining there with a duke who was their cousin was almost a religious solemnity it pleased archer to think that only an old new yorker could perceive the shade of difference to new york between being merely a duke and being the van der luydens duke new york took stray noblemen calmly and even except in the struthers set with a certain distrustful hauteur but when they presented such credentials as these they were received with an oldfashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken in ascribing solely to their standing in debrett it was for just such distinctions that the young man cherished his old new york even while he smiled at it the van der luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of the occasion the du lac sevres and the trevenna george ii plate were out so was the van der luyden lowestoft east india company and the dagonet crown derby mrs van der luyden looked more than ever like a cabanel and mrs archer in her grandmothers seedpearls and emeralds reminded her son of an isabey miniature all the ladies had on their handsomest jewels but it was characteristic of the house and the occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy oldfashioned settings and old miss lanning who had been persuaded to come actually wore her mothers cameos and a spanish blonde shawl the countess olenska was the only young woman at the dinner yet as archer scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich feathers they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers it frightened him to think what must have gone to the making of her eyes the duke of st austrey who sat at his hostesss right was naturally the chief figure of the evening but if the countess olenska was less conspicuous than had been hoped the duke was almost invisible being a wellbred man he had not like another recent ducal visitor come to the dinner in a shootingjacket but his evening clothes were so shabby and baggy and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun that with his stooping way of sitting and the vast beard spreading over his shirtfront he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner attire he was short roundshouldered sunburnt with a thick nose small eyes and a sociable smile but he seldom spoke and when he did it was in such low tones that despite the frequent silences of expectation about the table his remarks were lost to all but his neighbours when the men joined the ladies after dinner the duke went straight up to the countess olenska and they sat down in a corner and plunged into animated talk neither seemed aware that the duke should first have paid his respects to mrs lovell mingott and mrs headly chivers and the countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac mr urban dagonet of washington square who in order to have the pleasure of meeting her had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out between january and april the two chatted together for nearly twenty minutes then the countess rose and walking alone across the wide drawingroom sat down at newland archers side it was not the custom in new york drawingrooms for a lady to get up and walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of another etiquette required that she should wait immovable as an idol while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each other at her side but the countess was apparently unaware of having broken any rule she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside archer and looked at him with the kindest eyes i want you to talk to me about may she said instead of answering her he asked you knew the duke before oh yeswe used to see him every winter at nice hes very fond of gamblinghe used to come to the house a great deal she said it in the simplest manner as if she had said hes fond of wildflowers and after a moment she added candidly i think hes the dullest man i ever met this pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her previous remark had caused him it was undeniably exciting to meet a lady who found the van der luydens duke dull and dared to utter the opinion he longed to question her to hear more about the life of which her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse but he feared to touch on distressing memories and before he could think of anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject may is a darling ive seen no young girl in new york so handsome and so intelligent are you very much in love with her newland archer reddened and laughed as much as a man can be she continued to consider him thoughtfully as if not to miss any shade of meaning in what he said do you think then there is a limit to being in love if there is i havent found it she glowed with sympathy ahits really and truly a romance the most romantic of romances how delightful and you found it all out for yourselvesit was not in the least arranged for you archer looked at her incredulously have you forgotten he asked with a smile that in our country we dont allow our marriages to be arranged for us a dusky blush rose to her cheek and he instantly regretted his words yes she answered id forgotten you must forgive me if i sometimes make these mistakes i dont always remember that everything here is good that wasthat was bad where ive come from she looked down at her viennese fan of eagle feathers and he saw that her lips trembled im so sorry he said impulsively but you are among friends here you know yesi know wherever i go i have that feeling thats why i came home i want to forget everything else to become a complete american again like the mingotts and wellands and you and your delightful mother and all the other good people here tonight ah heres may arriving and you will want to hurry away to her she added but without moving and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the young mans face the drawingrooms were beginning to fill up with afterdinner guests and following madame olenskas glance archer saw may welland entering with her mother in her dress of white and silver with a wreath of silver blossoms in her hair the tall girl looked like a diana just alight from the chase oh said archer i have so many rivals you see shes already surrounded theres the duke being introduced then stay with me a little longer madame olenska said in a low tone just touching his knee with her plumed fan it was the lightest touch but it thrilled him like a caress yes let me stay he answered in the same tone hardly knowing what he said but just then mr van der luyden came up followed by old mr urban dagonet the countess greeted them with her grave smile and archer feeling his hosts admonitory glance on him rose and surrendered his seat madame olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye tomorrow then after fivei shall expect you she said and then turned back to make room for mr dagonet tomorrow archer heard himself repeating though there had been no engagement and during their talk she had given him no hint that she wished to see him again as he moved away he saw lawrence lefferts tall and resplendent leading his wife up to be introduced and heard gertrude lefferts say as she beamed on the countess with her large unperceiving smile but i think we used to go to dancingschool together when we were children behind her waiting their turn to name themselves to the countess archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had declined to meet her at mrs lovell mingotts as mrs archer remarked when the van der luydens chose they knew how to give a lesson the wonder was that they chose so seldom the young man felt a touch on his arm and saw mrs van der luyden looking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the family diamonds it was good of you dear newland to devote yourself so unselfishly to madame olenska i told your cousin henry he must really come to the rescue he was aware of smiling at her vaguely and she added as if condescending to his natural shyness ive never seen may looking lovelier the duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room the countess olenska had said after five and at half after the hour newland archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant wisteria throttling its feeble castiron balcony which she had hired far down west twentythird street from the vagabond medora it was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in small dressmakers birdstuffers and people who wrote were her nearest neighbours and further down the dishevelled street archer recognised a dilapidated wooden house at the end of a paved path in which a writer and journalist called winsett whom he used to come across now and then had mentioned that he lived winsett did not invite people to his house but he had once pointed it out to archer in the course of a nocturnal stroll and the latter had asked himself with a little shiver if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals madame olenskas own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance only by a little more paint about the windowframes and as archer mustered its modest front he said to himself that the polish count must have robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions the young man had spent an unsatisfactory day he had lunched with the wellands hoping afterward to carry off may for a walk in the park he wanted to have her to himself to tell her how enchanting she had looked the night before and how proud he was of her and to press her to hasten their marriage but mrs welland had firmly reminded him that the round of family visits was not half over and when he hinted at advancing the date of the wedding had raised reproachful eyebrows and sighed out twelve dozen of everythinghandembroidered packed in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to another and archer when the afternoons round was over parted from his betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild animal cunningly trapped he supposed that his readings in anthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after all a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling but when he remembered that the wellands did not expect the wedding to take place till the following autumn and pictured what his life would be till then a dampness fell upon his spirit tomorrow mrs welland called after him well do the chiverses and the dallases and he perceived that she was going through their two families alphabetically and that they were only in the first quarter of the alphabet he had meant to tell may of the countess olenskas requesther command ratherthat he should call on her that afternoon but in the brief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to say besides it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the matter he knew that may most particularly wanted him to be kind to her cousin was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of their engagement it gave him an odd sensation to reflect that but for the countesss arrival he might have been if not still a free man at least a man less irrevocably pledged but may had willed it so and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibilityand therefore at liberty if he chose to call on her cousin without telling her as he stood on madame olenskas threshold curiosity was his uppermost feeling he was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him he concluded that she was less simple than she seemed the door was opened by a swarthy foreignlooking maid with a prominent bosom under a gay neckerchief whom he vaguely fancied to be sicilian she welcomed him with all her white teeth and answering his enquiries by a headshake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into a low firelit drawingroom the room was empty and she left him for an appreciable time to wonder whether she had gone to find her mistress or whether she had not understood what he was there for and thought it might be to wind the clockof which he perceived that the only visible specimen had stopped he knew that the southern races communicated with each other in the language of pantomime and was mortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible at length she returned with a lamp and archer having meanwhile put together a phrase out of dante and petrarch evoked the answer la signora e fuori ma verra subito which he took to mean shes outbut youll soon see what he saw meanwhile with the help of the lamp was the faded shadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known he knew that the countess olenska had brought some of her possessions with herbits of wreckage she called themand these he supposed were represented by some small slender tables of dark wood a delicate little greek bronze on the chimneypiece and a stretch of red damask nailed on the discoloured wallpaper behind a couple of italianlooking pictures in old frames newland archer prided himself on his knowledge of italian art his boyhood had been saturated with ruskin and he had read all the latest books john addington symonds vernon lees euphorion the essays of p g hamerton and a wonderful new volume called the renaissance by walter pater he talked easily of botticelli and spoke of fra angelico with a faint condescension but these pictures bewildered him for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at and therefore able to see when he travelled in italy and perhaps also his powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding himself in this strange empty house where apparently no one expected him he was sorry that he had not told may welland of countess olenskas request and a little disturbed by the thought that his betrothed might come in to see her cousin what would she think if she found him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting alone in the dusk at a ladys fireside but since he had come he meant to wait and he sank into a chair and stretched his feet to the logs it was odd to have summoned him in that way and then forgotten him but archer felt more curious than mortified the atmosphere of the room was so different from any he had ever breathed that selfconsciousness vanished in the sense of adventure he had been before in drawingrooms hung with red damask with pictures of the italian school what struck him was the way in which medora mansons shabby hired house with its blighted background of pampas grass and rogers statuettes had by a turn of the hand and the skilful use of a few properties been transformed into something intimate foreign subtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments he tried to analyse the trick to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and tables were grouped in the fact that only two jacqueminot roses of which nobody ever bought less than a dozen had been placed in the slender vase at his elbow and in the vague pervading perfume that was not what one put on handkerchiefs but rather like the scent of some faroff bazaar a smell made up of turkish coffee and ambergris and dried roses his mind wandered away to the question of what mays drawingroom would look like he knew that mr welland who was behaving very handsomely already had his eye on a newly built house in east thirtyninth street the neighbourhood was thought remote and the house was built in a ghastly greenishyellow stone that the younger architects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone of which the uniform hue coated new york like a cold chocolate sauce but the plumbing was perfect archer would have liked to travel to put off the housing question but though the wellands approved of an extended european honeymoon perhaps even a winter in egypt they were firm as to the need of a house for the returning couple the young man felt that his fate was sealed for the rest of his life he would go up every evening between the castiron railings of that greenishyellow doorstep and pass through a pompeian vestibule into a hall with a wainscoting of varnished yellow wood but beyond that his imagination could not travel he knew the drawingroom above had a bay window but he could not fancy how may would deal with it she submitted cheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the welland drawingroom to its sham buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern saxe he saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything different in her own house and his only comfort was to reflect that she would probably let him arrange his library as he pleasedwhich would be of course with sincere eastlake furniture and the plain new bookcases without glass doors the roundbosomed maid came in drew the curtains pushed back a log and said consolingly verraverra when she had gone archer stood up and began to wander about should he wait any longer his position was becoming rather foolish perhaps he had misunderstood madame olenskaperhaps she had not invited him after all down the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a steppers hoofs they stopped before the house and he caught the opening of a carriage door parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk a streetlamp faced him and in its light he saw julius beauforts compact english brougham drawn by a big roan and the banker descending from it and helping out madame olenska beaufort stood hat in hand saying something which his companion seemed to negative then they shook hands and he jumped into his carriage while she mounted the steps when she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing archer there surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to how do you like my funny house she asked to me its like heaven as she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away with her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes youve arranged it delightfully he rejoined alive to the flatness of the words but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming desire to be simple and striking oh its a poor little place my relations despise it but at any rate its less gloomy than the van der luydens the words gave him an electric shock for few were the rebellious spirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der luydens gloomy those privileged to enter it shivered there and spoke of it as handsome but suddenly he was glad that she had given voice to the general shiver its deliciouswhat youve done here he repeated i like the little house she admitted but i suppose what i like is the blessedness of its being here in my own country and my own town and then of being alone in it she spoke so low that he hardly heard the last phrase but in his awkwardness he took it up you like so much to be alone yes as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely she sat down near the fire said nastasia will bring the tea presently and signed to him to return to his armchair adding i see youve already chosen your corner leaning back she folded her arms behind her head and looked at the fire under drooping lids this is the hour i like bestdont you a proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer i was afraid youd forgotten the hour beaufort must have been very engrossing she looked amused whyhave you waited long mr beaufort took me to see a number of housessince it seems im not to be allowed to stay in this one she appeared to dismiss both beaufort and himself from her mind and went on ive never been in a city where there seems to be such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques what does it matter where one lives im told this street is respectable its not fashionable fashionable do you all think so much of that why not make ones own fashions but i suppose ive lived too independently at any rate i want to do what you all doi want to feel cared for and safe he was touched as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her need of guidance thats what your friends want you to feel new yorks an awfully safe place he added with a flash of sarcasm yes isnt it one feels that she cried missing the mockery being here is likelikebeing taken on a holiday when one has been a good little girl and done all ones lessons the analogy was well meant but did not altogether please him he did not mind being flippant about new york but disliked to hear any one else take the same tone he wondered if she did not begin to see what a powerful engine it was and how nearly it had crushed her the lovell mingotts dinner patched up in extremis out of all sorts of social odds and ends ought to have taught her the narrowness of her escape but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted disaster or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van der luyden evening archer inclined to the former theory he fancied that her new york was still completely undifferentiated and the conjecture nettled him last night he said new york laid itself out for you the van der luydens do nothing by halves no how kind they are it was such a nice party every one seems to have such an esteem for them the terms were hardly adequate she might have spoken in that way of a teaparty at the dear old miss lannings the van der luydens said archer feeling himself pompous as he spoke are the most powerful influence in new york society unfortunatelyowing to her healththey receive very seldom she unclasped her hands from behind her head and looked at him meditatively isnt that perhaps the reason the reason for their great influence that they make themselves so rare he coloured a little stared at herand suddenly felt the penetration of the remark at a stroke she had pricked the van der luydens and they collapsed he laughed and sacrificed them nastasia brought the tea with handleless japanese cups and little covered dishes placing the tray on a low table but youll explain these things to meyoull tell me all i ought to know madame olenska continued leaning forward to hand him his cup its you who are telling me opening my eyes to things id looked at so long that id ceased to see them she detached a small gold cigarettecase from one of her bracelets held it out to him and took a cigarette herself on the chimney were long spills for lighting them ah then we can both help each other but i want help so much more you must tell me just what to do it was on the tip of his tongue to reply dont be seen driving about the streets with beaufort but he was being too deeply drawn into the atmosphere of the room which was her atmosphere and to give advice of that sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for attarofroses in samarkand that one should always be provided with arctics for a new york winter new york seemed much farther off than samarkand and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering what might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look at his native city objectively viewed thus as through the wrong end of a telescope it looked disconcertingly small and distant but then from samarkand it would a flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire stretching her thin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails the light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her braids and made her pale face paler there are plenty of people to tell you what to do archer rejoined obscurely envious of them ohall my aunts and my dear old granny she considered the idea impartially theyre all a little vexed with me for setting up for myselfpoor granny especially she wanted to keep me with her but i had to be free he was impressed by this light way of speaking of the formidable catherine and moved by the thought of what must have given madame olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of freedom but the idea of beaufort gnawed him i think i understand how you feel he said still your family can advise you explain differences show you the way she lifted her thin black eyebrows is new york such a labyrinth i thought it so straight up and downlike fifth avenue and with all the cross streets numbered she seemed to guess his faint disapproval of this and added with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face if you knew how i like it for just thatthe straightupanddownness and the big honest labels on everything he saw his chance everything may be labelledbut everybody is not perhaps i may simplify too muchbut youll warn me if i do she turned from the fire to look at him there are only two people here who make me feel as if they understood what i mean and could explain things to me you and mr beaufort archer winced at the joining of the names and then with a quick readjustment understood sympathised and pitied so close to the powers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely in their air but since she felt that he understood her also his business would be to make her see beaufort as he really was with all he representedand abhor it he answered gently i understand but just at first dont let go of your old friends hands i mean the older women your granny mingott mrs welland mrs van der luyden they like and admire youthey want to help you she shook her head and sighed oh i knowi know but on condition that they dont hear anything unpleasant aunt welland put it in those very words when i tried does no one want to know the truth here mr archer the real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend she lifted her hands to her face and he saw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob madame olenskaoh dont ellen he cried starting up and bending over her he drew down one of her hands clasping and chafing it like a childs while he murmured reassuring words but in a moment she freed herself and looked up at him with wet lashes does no one cry here either i suppose theres no need to in heaven she said straightening her loosened braids with a laugh and bending over the teakettle it was burnt into his consciousness that he had called her ellencalled her so twice and that she had not noticed it far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white figure of may wellandin new york suddenly nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich italian madame olenska again with a hand at her hair uttered an exclamation of assenta flashing giagiaand the duke of st austrey entered piloting a tremendous blackwigged and redplumed lady in overflowing furs my dear countess ive brought an old friend of mine to see youmrs struthers she wasnt asked to the party last night and she wants to know you the duke beamed on the group and madame olenska advanced with a murmur of welcome toward the queer couple she seemed to have no idea how oddly matched they were nor what a liberty the duke had taken in bringing his companionand to do him justice as archer perceived the duke seemed as unaware of it himself of course i want to know you my dear cried mrs struthers in a round rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig i want to know everybody whos young and interesting and charming and the duke tells me you like musicdidnt you duke youre a pianist yourself i believe well do you want to hear sarasate play tomorrow evening at my house you know ive something going on every sunday eveningits the day when new york doesnt know what to do with itself and so i say to it come and be amused and the duke thought youd be tempted by sarasate youll find a number of your friends madame olenskas face grew brilliant with pleasure how kind how good of the duke to think of me she pushed a chair up to the teatable and mrs struthers sank into it delectably of course i shall be too happy to come thats all right my dear and bring your young gentleman with you mrs struthers extended a hailfellow hand to archer i cant put a name to youbut im sure ive met youive met everybody here or in paris or london arent you in diplomacy all the diplomatists come to me you like music too duke you must be sure to bring him the duke said rather from the depths of his beard and archer withdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of spine as a selfconscious schoolboy among careless and unnoticing elders he was not sorry for the denouement of his visit he only wished it had come sooner and spared him a certain waste of emotion as he went out into the wintry night new york again became vast and imminent and may welland the loveliest woman in it he turned into his florists to send her the daily box of liliesofthevalley which to his confusion he found he had forgotten that morning as he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced about the embowered shop and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses he had never seen any as sungolden before and his first impulse was to send them to may instead of the lilies but they did not look like herthere was something too rich too strong in their fiery beauty in a sudden revulsion of mood and almost without knowing what he did he signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box and slipped his card into a second envelope on which he wrote the name of the countess olenska then just as he was turning away he drew the card out again and left the empty envelope on the box theyll go at once he enquired pointing to the roses the florist assured him that they would the next day he persuaded may to escape for a walk in the park after luncheon as was the custom in oldfashioned episcopalian new york she usually accompanied her parents to church on sunday afternoons but mrs welland condoned her truancy having that very morning won her over to the necessity of a long engagement with time to prepare a handembroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens the day was delectable the bare vaulting of trees along the mall was ceiled with lapis lazuli and arched above snow that shone like splintered crystals it was the weather to call out mays radiance and she burned like a young maple in the frost archer was proud of the glances turned on her and the simple joy of possessorship cleared away his underlying perplexities its so deliciouswaking every morning to smell liliesofthevalley in ones room she said yesterday they came late i hadnt time in the morning but your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much more than if youd given a standing order and they came every morning on the minute like ones musicteacheras i know gertrude leffertss did for instance when she and lawrence were engaged ahthey would laughed archer amused at her keenness he looked sideways at her fruitlike cheek and felt rich and secure enough to add when i sent your lilies yesterday afternoon i saw some rather gorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to madame olenska was that right how dear of you anything of that kind delights her its odd she didnt mention it she lunched with us today and spoke of mr beauforts having sent her wonderful orchids and cousin henry van der luyden a whole hamper of carnations from skuytercliff she seems so surprised to receive flowers dont people send them in europe she thinks it such a pretty custom oh well no wonder mine were overshadowed by beauforts said archer irritably then he remembered that he had not put a card with the roses and was vexed at having spoken of them he wanted to say i called on your cousin yesterday but hesitated if madame olenska had not spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should yet not to do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked to shake off the question he began to talk of their own plans their future and mrs wellands insistence on a long engagement if you call it long isabel chivers and reggie were engaged for two years grace and thorley for nearly a year and a half why arent we very well off as we are it was the traditional maidenly interrogation and he felt ashamed of himself for finding it singularly childish no doubt she simply echoed what was said for her but she was nearing her twentysecond birthday and he wondered at what age nice women began to speak for themselves never if we wont let them i suppose he mused and recalled his mad outburst to mr sillerton jackson women ought to be as free as we are it would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young womans eyes and bid her look forth on the world but how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault he shivered a little remembering some of the new ideas in his scientific books and the muchcited instance of the kentucky cavefish which had ceased to develop eyes because they had no use for them what if when he had bidden may welland to open hers they could only look out blankly at blankness we might be much better off we might be altogether togetherwe might travel her face lit up that would be lovely she owned she would love to travel but her mother would not understand their wanting to do things so differently as if the mere differently didnt account for it the wooer insisted newland youre so original she exulted his heart sank for he saw that he was saying all the things that young men in the same situation were expected to say and that she was making the answers that instinct and tradition taught her to makeeven to the point of calling him original original were all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper were like patterns stencilled on a wall cant you and i strike out for ourselves may he had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion and her eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration mercyshall we elope she laughed if you would you do love me newland im so happy but thenwhy not be happier we cant behave like people in novels though can we why notwhy notwhy not she looked a little bored by his insistence she knew very well that they couldnt but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason im not clever enough to argue with you but that kind of thing is rathervulgar isnt it she suggested relieved to have hit on a word that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject are you so much afraid then of being vulgar she was evidently staggered by this of course i should hate itso would you she rejoined a trifle irritably he stood silent beating his stick nervously against his boottop and feeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the discussion she went on lightheartedly oh did i tell you that i showed ellen my ring she thinks it the most beautiful setting she ever saw theres nothing like it in the rue de la paix she said i do love you newland for being so artistic the next afternoon as archer before dinner sat smoking sullenly in his study janey wandered in on him he had failed to stop at his club on the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the law in the leisurely manner common to welltodo new yorkers of his class he was out of spirits and slightly out of temper and a haunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour besieged his brain samenesssameness he muttered the word running through his head like a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tallhatted figures lounging behind the plateglass and because he usually dropped in at the club at that hour he had gone home instead he knew not only what they were likely to be talking about but the part each one would take in the discussion the duke of course would be their principal theme though the appearance in fifth avenue of a goldenhaired lady in a small canarycoloured brougham with a pair of black cobs for which beaufort was generally thought responsible would also doubtless be thoroughly gone into such women as they were called were few in new york those driving their own carriages still fewer and the appearance of miss fanny ring in fifth avenue at the fashionable hour had profoundly agitated society only the day before her carriage had passed mrs lovell mingotts and the latter had instantly rung the little bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home what if it had happened to mrs van der luyden people asked each other with a shudder archer could hear lawrence lefferts at that very hour holding forth on the disintegration of society he raised his head irritably when his sister janey entered and then quickly bent over his book swinburnes chastelardjust out as if he had not seen her she glanced at the writingtable heaped with books opened a volume of the contes drolatiques made a wry face over the archaic french and sighed what learned things you read well he asked as she hovered cassandralike before him mothers very angry angry with whom about what miss sophy jackson has just been here she brought word that her brother would come in after dinner she couldnt say very much because he forbade her to he wishes to give all the details himself hes with cousin louisa van der luyden now for heavens sake my dear girl try a fresh start it would take an omniscient deity to know what youre talking about its not a time to be profane newland mother feels badly enough about your not going to church with a groan he plunged back into his book newland do listen your friend madame olenska was at mrs lemuel strutherss party last night she went there with the duke and mr beaufort at the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the young mans breast to smother it he laughed well what of it i knew she meant to janey paled and her eyes began to project you knew she meant toand you didnt try to stop her to warn her stop her warn her he laughed again im not engaged to be married to the countess olenska the words had a fantastic sound in his own ears youre marrying into her family oh familyfamily he jeered newlanddont you care about family not a brass farthing nor about what cousin louisa van der luyden will think not the half of oneif she thinks such old maids rubbish mother is not an old maid said his virgin sister with pinched lips he felt like shouting back yes she is and so are the van der luydens and so we all are when it comes to being so much as brushed by the wingtip of reality but he saw her long gentle face puckering into tears and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting hang countess olenska dont be a goose janeyim not her keeper no but you did ask the wellands to announce your engagement sooner so that we might all back her up and if it hadnt been for that cousin louisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the duke wellwhat harm was there in inviting her she was the bestlooking woman in the room she made the dinner a little less funereal than the usual van der luyden banquet you know cousin henry asked her to please you he persuaded cousin louisa and now theyre so upset that theyre going back to skuytercliff tomorrow i think newland youd better come down you dont seem to understand how mother feels in the drawingroom newland found his mother she raised a troubled brow from her needlework to ask has janey told you yes he tried to keep his tone as measured as her own but i cant take it very seriously not the fact of having offended cousin louisa and cousin henry the fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as countess olenskas going to the house of a woman they consider common consider well who is but who has good music and amuses people on sunday evenings when the whole of new york is dying of inanition good music all i know is there was a woman who got up on a table and sang the things they sing at the places you go to in paris there was smoking and champagne wellthat kind of thing happens in other places and the world still goes on i dont suppose dear youre really defending the french sunday ive heard you often enough mother grumble at the english sunday when weve been in london new york is neither paris nor london oh no its not her son groaned you mean i suppose that society here is not as brilliant youre right i daresay but we belong here and people should respect our ways when they come among us ellen olenska especially she came back to get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies newland made no answer and after a moment his mother ventured i was going to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin louisa for a moment before dinner he frowned and she continued i thought you might explain to her what youve just said that society abroad is different that people are not as particular and that madame olenska may not have realised how we feel about such things it would be you know dear she added with an innocent adroitness in madame olenskas interest if you did dearest mother i really dont see how were concerned in the matter the duke took madame olenska to mrs strutherssin fact he brought mrs struthers to call on her i was there when they came if the van der luydens want to quarrel with anybody the real culprit is under their own roof quarrel newland did you ever know of cousin henrys quarrelling besides the dukes his guest and a stranger too strangers dont discriminate how should they countess olenska is a new yorker and should have respected the feelings of new york well then if they must have a victim you have my leave to throw madame olenska to them cried her son exasperated i dont see myselfor you eitheroffering ourselves up to expiate her crimes oh of course you see only the mingott side his mother answered in the sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger the sad butler drew back the drawingroom portieres and announced mr henry van der luyden mrs archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an agitated hand another lamp she cried to the retreating servant while janey bent over to straighten her mothers cap mr van der luydens figure loomed on the threshold and newland archer went forward to greet his cousin we were just talking about you sir he said mr van der luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement he drew off his glove to shake hands with the ladies and smoothed his tall hat shyly while janey pushed an armchair forward and archer continued and the countess olenska mrs archer paled aha charming woman i have just been to see her said mr van der luyden complacency restored to his brow he sank into the chair laid his hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the oldfashioned way and went on she has a real gift for arranging flowers i had sent her a few carnations from skuytercliff and i was astonished instead of massing them in big bunches as our headgardener does she had scattered them about loosely here and there i cant say how the duke had told me he said go and see how cleverly shes arranged her drawingroom and she has i should really like to take louisa to see her if the neighbourhood were not sounpleasant a dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from mr van der luyden mrs archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which she had nervously tumbled it and newland leaning against the chimneyplace and twisting a hummingbirdfeather screen in his hand saw janeys gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp the fact is mr van der luyden continued stroking his long grey leg with a bloodless hand weighed down by the patroons great signetring the fact is i dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she wrote me about my flowers and alsobut this is between ourselves of courseto give her a friendly warning about allowing the duke to carry her off to parties with him i dont know if youve heard mrs archer produced an indulgent smile has the duke been carrying her off to parties you know what these english grandees are theyre all alike louisa and i are very fond of our cousinbut its hopeless to expect people who are accustomed to the european courts to trouble themselves about our little republican distinctions the duke goes where hes amused mr van der luyden paused but no one spoke yesit seems he took her with him last night to mrs lemuel strutherss sillerton jackson has just been to us with the foolish story and louisa was rather troubled so i thought the shortest way was to go straight to countess olenska and explainby the merest hint you knowhow we feel in new york about certain things i felt i might without indelicacy because the evening she dined with us she rather suggested rather let me see that she would be grateful for guidance and she was mr van der luyden looked about the room with what would have been selfsatisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions on his face it became a mild benevolence which mrs archers countenance dutifully reflected how kind you both are dear henryalways newland will particularly appreciate what you have done because of dear may and his new relations she shot an admonitory glance at her son who said immensely sir but i was sure youd like madame olenska mr van der luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness i never ask to my house my dear newland he said any one whom i do not like and so i have just told sillerton jackson with a glance at the clock he rose and added but louisa will be waiting we are dining early to take the duke to the opera after the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence fell upon the archer family gracioushow romantic at last broke explosively from janey no one knew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments and her relations had long since given up trying to interpret them mrs archer shook her head with a sigh provided it all turns out for the best she said in the tone of one who knows how surely it will not newland you must stay and see sillerton jackson when he comes this evening i really shant know what to say to him poor mother but he wont come her son laughed stooping to kiss away her frown some two weeks later newland archer sitting in abstracted idleness in his private compartment of the office of letterblair lamson and low attorneys at law was summoned by the head of the firm old mr letterblair the accredited legal adviser of three generations of new york gentility throned behind his mahogany desk in evident perplexity as he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his hand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows his disrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the family physician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified my dear sir he always addressed archer as siri have sent for you to go into a little matter a matter which for the moment i prefer not to mention either to mr skipworth or mr redwood the gentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm for as was always the case with legal associations of old standing in new york all the partners named on the office letterhead were long since dead and mr letterblair for example was professionally speaking his own grandson he leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow for family reasons he continued archer looked up the mingott family said mr letterblair with an explanatory smile and bow mrs manson mingott sent for me yesterday her granddaughter the countess olenska wishes to sue her husband for divorce certain papers have been placed in my hands he paused and drummed on his desk in view of your prospective alliance with the family i should like to consult youto consider the case with youbefore taking any farther steps archer felt the blood in his temples he had seen the countess olenska only once since his visit to her and then at the opera in the mingott box during this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate image receding from his foreground as may welland resumed her rightful place in it he had not heard her divorce spoken of since janeys first random allusion to it and had dismissed the tale as unfounded gossip theoretically the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful to him as to his mother and he was annoyed that mr letterblair no doubt prompted by old catherine mingott should be so evidently planning to draw him into the affair after all there were plenty of mingott men for such jobs and as yet he was not even a mingott by marriage he waited for the senior partner to continue mr letterblair unlocked a drawer and drew out a packet if you will run your eye over these papers archer frowned i beg your pardon sir but just because of the prospective relationship i should prefer your consulting mr skipworth or mr redwood mr letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended it was unusual for a junior to reject such an opening he bowed i respect your scruple sir but in this case i believe true delicacy requires you to do as i ask indeed the suggestion is not mine but mrs manson mingotts and her sons i have seen lovell mingott and also mr welland they all named you archer felt his temper rising he had been somewhat languidly drifting with events for the last fortnight and letting mays fair looks and radiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the mingott claims but this behest of old mrs mingotts roused him to a sense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a prospective soninlaw and he chafed at the role her uncles ought to deal with this he said they have the matter has been gone into by the family they are opposed to the countesss idea but she is firm and insists on a legal opinion the young man was silent he had not opened the packet in his hand does she want to marry again i believe it is suggested but she denies it then will you oblige me mr archer by first looking through these papers afterward when we have talked the case over i will give you my opinion archer withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents since their last meeting he had halfunconsciously collaborated with events in ridding himself of the burden of madame olenska his hour alone with her by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which the duke of st austreys intrusion with mrs lemuel struthers and the countesss joyous greeting of them had rather providentially broken two days later archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement in the van der luydens favour and had said to himself with a touch of tartness that a lady who knew how to thank allpowerful elderly gentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need either the private consolations or the public championship of a young man of his small compass to look at the matter in this light simplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim domestic virtues he could not picture may welland in whatever conceivable emergency hawking about her private difficulties and lavishing her confidences on strange men and she had never seemed to him finer or fairer than in the week that followed he had even yielded to her wish for a long engagement since she had found the one disarming answer to his plea for haste you know when it comes to the point your parents have always let you have your way ever since you were a little girl he argued and she had answered with her clearest look yes and thats what makes it so hard to refuse the very last thing theyll ever ask of me as a little girl that was the old new york note that was the kind of answer he would like always to be sure of his wifes making if one had habitually breathed the new york air there were times when anything less crystalline seemed stifling the papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact but they plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered they consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between count olenskis solicitors and a french legal firm to whom the countess had applied for the settlement of her financial situation there was also a short letter from the count to his wife after reading it newland archer rose jammed the papers back into their envelope and reentered mr letterblairs office here are the letters sir if you wish ill see madame olenska he said in a constrained voice thank youthank you mr archer come and dine with me tonight if youre free and well go into the matter afterward in case you wish to call on our client tomorrow newland archer walked straight home again that afternoon it was a winter evening of transparent clearness with an innocent young moon above the housetops and he wanted to fill his souls lungs with the pure radiance and not exchange a word with any one till he and mr letterblair were closeted together after dinner it was impossible to decide otherwise than he had done he must see madame olenska himself rather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes a great wave of compassion had swept away his indifference and impatience she stood before him as an exposed and pitiful figure to be saved at all costs from farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate he remembered what she had told him of mrs wellands request to be spared whatever was unpleasant in her history and winced at the thought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the new york air so pure are we only pharisees after all he wondered puzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human vileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty for the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had always been he passed for a young man who had not been afraid of risks and he knew that his secret loveaffair with poor silly mrs thorley rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming air of adventure but mrs rushworth was that kind of woman foolish vain clandestine by nature and far more attracted by the secrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he possessed when the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart but now it seemed the redeeming feature of the case the affair in short had been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been through and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed belief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyedand pitied in this view they were sedulously abetted by their mothers aunts and other elderly female relatives who all shared mrs archers belief that when such things happened it was undoubtedly foolish of the man but somehow always criminal of the woman all the elderly ladies whom archer knew regarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous and designing and mere simpleminded man as powerless in her clutches the only thing to do was to persuade him as early as possible to marry a nice girl and then trust to her to look after him in the complicated old european communities archer began to guess loveproblems might be less simple and less easily classified rich and idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such situations and there might even be one in which a woman naturally sensitive and aloof would yet from the force of circumstances from sheer defencelessness and loneliness be drawn into a tie inexcusable by conventional standards on reaching home he wrote a line to the countess olenska asking at what hour of the next day she could receive him and despatched it by a messengerboy who returned presently with a word to the effect that she was going to skuytercliff the next morning to stay over sunday with the van der luydens but that he would find her alone that evening after dinner the note was written on a rather untidy halfsheet without date or address but her hand was firm and free he was amused at the idea of her weekending in the stately solitude of skuytercliff but immediately afterward felt that there of all places she would most feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the unpleasant he was at mr letterblairs punctually at seven glad of the pretext for excusing himself soon after dinner he had formed his own opinion from the papers entrusted to him and did not especially want to go into the matter with his senior partner mr letterblair was a widower and they dined alone copiously and slowly in a dark shabby room hung with yellowing prints of the death of chatham and the coronation of napoleon on the sideboard between fluted sheraton knifecases stood a decanter of haut brion and another of the old lanning port the gift of a client which the wastrel tom lanning had sold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in san franciscoan incident less publicly humiliating to the family than the sale of the cellar after a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers then a young broiled turkey with corn fritters followed by a canvasback with currant jelly and a celery mayonnaise mr letterblair who lunched on a sandwich and tea dined deliberately and deeply and insisted on his guests doing the same finally when the closing rites had been accomplished the cloth was removed cigars were lit and mr letterblair leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward said spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him the whole family are against a divorce and i think rightly archer instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument but why sir if there ever was a case wellwhats the use shes herehes there the atlantics between them shell never get back a dollar more of her money than what hes voluntarily returned to her their damned heathen marriage settlements take precious good care of that as things go over there olenskis acted generously he might have turned her out without a penny the young man knew this and was silent i understand though mr letterblair continued that she attaches no importance to the money therefore as the family say why not let well enough alone archer had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with mr letterblairs view but put into words by this selfish wellfed and supremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the pharisaic voice of a society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant i think thats for her to decide hmhave you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce you mean the threat in her husbands letter what weight would that carry its no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard yes but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the suit unpleasant said archer explosively mr letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows and the young man aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in his mind bowed acquiescently while his senior continued divorce is always unpleasant you agree with me mr letterblair resumed after a waiting silence naturally said archer well then i may count on you the mingotts may count on you to use your influence against the idea archer hesitated i cant pledge myself till ive seen the countess olenska he said at length mr archer i dont understand you do you want to marry into a family with a scandalous divorcesuit hanging over it i dont think that has anything to do with the case mr letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young partner a cautious and apprehensive gaze archer understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn and for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect now that the job had been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it and to guard against the possibility he saw that he must reassure the unimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the mingotts you may be sure sir that i shant commit myself till ive reported to you what i meant was that id rather not give an opinion till ive heard what madame olenska has to say mr letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of the best new york tradition and the young man glancing at his watch pleaded an engagement and took leave oldfashioned new york dined at seven and the habit of afterdinner calls though derided in archers set still generally prevailed as the young man strolled up fifth avenue from waverley place the long thoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before the reggie chiverses where there was a dinner for the duke and the occasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler ascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gaslit hall thus as archer crossed washington square he remarked that old mr du lac was calling on his cousins the dagonets and turning down the corner of west tenth street he saw mr skipworth of his own firm obviously bound on a visit to the miss lannings a little farther up fifth avenue beaufort appeared on his doorstep darkly projected against a blaze of light descended to his private brougham and rolled away to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination it was not an opera night and no one was giving a party so that beauforts outing was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature archer connected it in his mind with a little house beyond lexington avenue in which beribboned window curtains and flowerboxes had recently appeared and before whose newly painted door the canarycoloured brougham of miss fanny ring was frequently seen to wait beyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed mrs archers world lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists musicians and people who wrote these scattered fragments of humanity had never shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure in spite of odd ways they were said to be for the most part quite respectable but they preferred to keep to themselves medora manson in her prosperous days had inaugurated a literary salon but it had soon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it others had made the same attempt and there was a household of blenkersan intense and voluble mother and three blowsy daughters who imitated herwhere one met edwin booth and patti and william winter and the new shakespearian actor george rignold and some of the magazine editors and musical and literary critics mrs archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these persons they were odd they were uncertain they had things one didnt know about in the background of their lives and minds literature and art were deeply respected in the archer set and mrs archer was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable and cultivated society had been when it included such figures as washington irving fitzgreene halleck and the poet of the culprit fay the most celebrated authors of that generation had been gentlemen perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had gentlemanly sentiments but their origin their appearance their hair their intimacy with the stage and the opera made any old new york criterion inapplicable to them when i was a girl mrs archer used to say we knew everybody between the battery and canal street and only the people one knew had carriages it was perfectly easy to place any one then now one cant tell and i prefer not to try only old catherine mingott with her absence of moral prejudices and almost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions might have bridged the abyss but she had never opened a book or looked at a picture and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala nights at the italiens in the days of her triumph at the tuileries possibly beaufort who was her match in daring would have succeeded in bringing about a fusion but his grand house and silkstockinged footmen were an obstacle to informal sociability moreover he was as illiterate as old mrs mingott and considered fellows who wrote as the mere paid purveyors of rich mens pleasures and no one rich enough to influence his opinion had ever questioned it newland archer had been aware of these things ever since he could remember and had accepted them as part of the structure of his universe he knew that there were societies where painters and poets and novelists and men of science and even great actors were as sought after as dukes he had often pictured to himself what it would have been to live in the intimacy of drawingrooms dominated by the talk of merimee whose lettres a une inconnue was one of his inseparables of thackeray browning or william morris but such things were inconceivable in new york and unsettling to think of archer knew most of the fellows who wrote the musicians and the painters he met them at the century or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that were beginning to come into existence he enjoyed them there and was bored with them at the blenkers where they were mingled with fervid and dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities and even after his most exciting talks with ned winsett he always came away with the feeling that if his world was small so was theirs and that the only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where they would naturally merge he was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the countess olenska had lived and suffered and alsoperhapstasted mysterious joys he remembered with what amusement she had told him that her grandmother mingott and the wellands objected to her living in a bohemian quarter given over to people who wrote it was not the peril but the poverty that her family disliked but that shade escaped her and she supposed they considered literature compromising she herself had no fears of it and the books scattered about her drawingroom a part of the house in which books were usually supposed to be out of place though chiefly works of fiction had whetted archers interest with such new names as those of paul bourget huysmans and the goncourt brothers ruminating on these things as he approached her door he was once more conscious of the curious way in which she reversed his values and of the need of thinking himself into conditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be of use in her present difficulty nastasia opened the door smiling mysteriously on the bench in the hall lay a sablelined overcoat a folded opera hat of dull silk with a gold j b on the lining and a white silk muffler there was no mistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of julius beaufort archer was angry so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his card and going away then he remembered that in writing to madame olenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he wished to see her privately he had therefore no one but himself to blame if she had opened her doors to other visitors and he entered the drawingroom with the dogged determination to make beaufort feel himself in the way and to outstay him the banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf which was draped with an old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church candles of yellowish wax he had thrust his chest out supporting his shoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large patentleather foot as archer entered he was smiling and looking down on his hostess who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the chimney a table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it and against the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as tributes from the beaufort hothouses madame olenska sat halfreclined her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving the arm bare to the elbow it was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were called simple dinner dresses a closefitting armour of whaleboned silk slightly open in the neck with lace ruffles filling in the crack and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to show an etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band but madame olenska heedless of tradition was attired in a long robe of red velvet bordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur archer remembered on his last visit to paris seeing a portrait by the new painter carolus duran whose pictures were the sensation of the salon in which the lady wore one of these bold sheathlike robes with her chin nestling in fur there was something perverse and provocative in the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawingroom and in the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms but the effect was undeniably pleasing lord love usthree whole days at skuytercliff beaufort was saying in his loud sneering voice as archer entered youd better take all your furs and a hotwaterbottle why is the house so cold she asked holding out her left hand to archer in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss it no but the missus is said beaufort nodding carelessly to the young man but i thought her so kind she came herself to invite me granny says i must certainly go granny would of course and i say its a shame youre going to miss the little oyster supper id planned for you at delmonicos next sunday with campanini and scalchi and a lot of jolly people she looked doubtfully from the banker to archer ahthat does tempt me except the other evening at mrs strutherss ive not met a single artist since ive been here what kind of artists i know one or two painters very good fellows that i could bring to see you if youd allow me said archer boldly painters are there painters in new york asked beaufort in a tone implying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures and madame olenska said to archer with her grave smile that would be charming but i was really thinking of dramatic artists singers actors musicians my husbands house was always full of them she said the words my husband as if no sinister associations were connected with them and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the lost delights of her married life archer looked at her perplexedly wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to touch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her reputation in order to break with it i do think she went on addressing both men that the imprevu adds to ones enjoyment its perhaps a mistake to see the same people every day its confoundedly dull anyhow new york is dying of dullness beaufort grumbled and when i try to liven it up for you you go back on me comethink better of it sunday is your last chance for campanini leaves next week for baltimore and philadelphia and ive a private room and a steinway and theyll sing all night for me how delicious may i think it over and write to you tomorrow morning she spoke amiably yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice beaufort evidently felt it and being unused to dismissals stood staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes why not now its too serious a question to decide at this late hour do you call it late she returned his glance coolly yes because i have still to talk business with mr archer for a little while ah beaufort snapped there was no appeal from her tone and with a slight shrug he recovered his composure took her hand which he kissed with a practised air and calling out from the threshold i say newland if you can persuade the countess to stop in town of course youre included in the supper left the room with his heavy important step for a moment archer fancied that mr letterblair must have told her of his coming but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his mind you know painters then you live in their milieu she asked her eyes full of interest oh not exactly i dont know that the arts have a milieu here any of them theyre more like a very thinly settled outskirt but you care for such things immensely when im in paris or london i never miss an exhibition i try to keep up she looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from her long draperies i used to care immensely too my life was full of such things but now i want to try not to you want to try not to yes i want to cast off all my old life to become just like everybody else here archer reddened youll never be like everybody else he said she raised her straight eyebrows a little ah dont say that if you knew how i hate to be different her face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask she leaned forward clasping her knee in her thin hands and looking away from him into remote dark distances i want to get away from it all she insisted he waited a moment and cleared his throat i know mr letterblair has told me ah thats the reason ive come he asked me toyou see im in the firm she looked slightly surprised and then her eyes brightened you mean you can manage it for me i can talk to you instead of mr letterblair oh that will be so much easier her tone touched him and his confidence grew with his selfsatisfaction he perceived that she had spoken of business to beaufort simply to get rid of him and to have routed beaufort was something of a triumph i am here to talk about it he repeated she sat silent her head still propped by the arm that rested on the back of the sofa her face looked pale and extinguished as if dimmed by the rich red of her dress she struck archer of a sudden as a pathetic and even pitiful figure now were coming to hard facts he thought conscious in himself of the same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his mother and her contemporaries how little practice he had had in dealing with unusual situations their very vocabulary was unfamiliar to him and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage in face of what was coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy after a pause madame olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence i want to be free i want to wipe out all the past i understand that her face warmed then youll help me first he hesitatedperhaps i ought to know a little more she seemed surprised you know about my husbandmy life with him he made a sign of assent wellthenwhat more is there in this country are such things tolerated im a protestantour church does not forbid divorce in such cases certainly not they were both silent again and archer felt the spectre of count olenskis letter grimacing hideously between them the letter filled only half a page and was just what he had described it to be in speaking of it to mr letterblair the vague charge of an angry blackguard but how much truth was behind it only count olenskis wife could tell ive looked through the papers you gave to mr letterblair he said at length wellcan there be anything more abominable no she changed her position slightly screening her eyes with her lifted hand of course you know archer continued that if your husband chooses to fight the caseas he threatens to yes he can say thingsthings that might be unplmight be disagreeable to you say them publicly so that they would get about and harm you even if if i mean no matter how unfounded they were she paused for a long interval so long that not wishing to keep his eyes on her shaded face he had time to imprint on his mind the exact shape of her other hand the one on her knee and every detail of the three rings on her fourth and fifth fingers among which he noticed a wedding ring did not appear what harm could such accusations even if he made them publicly do me here it was on his lips to exclaim my poor childfar more harm than anywhere else instead he answered in a voice that sounded in his ears like mr letterblairs new york society is a very small world compared with the one youve lived in and its ruled in spite of appearances by a few people withwell rather oldfashioned ideas she said nothing and he continued our ideas about marriage and divorce are particularly oldfashioned our legislation favours divorceour social customs dont never wellnot if the woman however injured however irreproachable has appearances in the least degree against her has exposed herself by any unconventional action toto offensive insinuations she drooped her head a little lower and he waited again intensely hoping for a flash of indignation or at least a brief cry of denial none came a little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow and a log broke in two and sent up a shower of sparks the whole hushed and brooding room seemed to be waiting silently with archer yes she murmured at length thats what my family tell me he winced a little its not unnatural our family she corrected herself and archer coloured for youll be my cousin soon she continued gently i hope so and you take their view he stood up at this wandered across the room stared with void eyes at one of the pictures against the old red damask and came back irresolutely to her side how could he say yes if what your husband hints is true or if youve no way of disproving it sincerely she interjected as he was about to speak he looked down into the fire sincerely thenwhat should you gain that would compensate for the possibilitythe certaintyof a lot of beastly talk but my freedomis that nothing it flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was true and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt how was he to tell her that if she really cherished such a plan the laws of the state were inexorably opposed to it the mere suspicion that the thought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward her but arent you as free as air as it is he returned who can touch you mr letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled oh yes she said indifferently well then is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful think of the newspaperstheir vileness its all stupid and narrow and unjustbut one cant make over society no she acquiesced and her tone was so faint and desolate that he felt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts the individual in such cases is nearly always sacrificed to what is supposed to be the collective interest people cling to any convention that keeps the family togetherprotects the children if there are any he rambled on pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his lips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her silence seemed to have laid bare since she would not or could not say the one word that would have cleared the air his wish was not to let her feel that he was trying to probe into her secret better keep on the surface in the prudent old new york way than risk uncovering a wound he could not heal its my business you know he went on to help you to see these things as the people who are fondest of you see them the mingotts the wellands the van der luydens all your friends and relations if i didnt show you honestly how they judge such questions it wouldnt be fair of me would it he spoke insistently almost pleading with her in his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence she said slowly no it wouldnt be fair the fire had crumbled down to greyness and one of the lamps made a gurgling appeal for attention madame olenska rose wound it up and returned to the fire but without resuming her seat her remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more for either of them to say and archer stood up also very well i will do what you wish she said abruptly the blood rushed to his forehead and taken aback by the suddenness of her surrender he caught her two hands awkwardly in his ii do want to help you he said you do help me good night my cousin he bent and laid his lips on her hands which were cold and lifeless she drew them away and he turned to the door found his coat and hat under the faint gaslight of the hall and plunged out into the winter night bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate it was a crowded night at wallacks theatre the play was the shaughraun with dion boucicault in the title role and harry montague and ada dyas as the lovers the popularity of the admirable english company was at its height and the shaughraun always packed the house in the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved in the stalls and boxes people smiled a little at the hackneyed sentiments and claptrap situations and enjoyed the play as much as the galleries did there was one episode in particular that held the house from floor to ceiling it was that in which harry montague after a sad almost monosyllabic scene of parting with miss dyas bade her goodbye and turned to go the actress who was standing near the mantelpiece and looking down into the fire wore a gray cashmere dress without fashionable loopings or trimmings moulded to her tall figure and flowing in long lines about her feet around her neck was a narrow black velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back when her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the mantelshelf and bowed her face in her hands on the threshold he paused to look at her then he stole back lifted one of the ends of velvet ribbon kissed it and left the room without her hearing him or changing her attitude and on this silent parting the curtain fell it was always for the sake of that particular scene that newland archer went to see the shaughraun he thought the adieux of montague and ada dyas as fine as anything he had ever seen croisette and bressant do in paris or madge robertson and kendal in london in its reticence its dumb sorrow it moved him more than the most famous histrionic outpourings on the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy by reminding himhe could not have said whyof his leavetaking from madame olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier it would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the two situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned newland archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young english actors romantic good looks and miss dyas was a tall redhaired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly face was utterly unlike ellen olenskas vivid countenance nor were archer and madame olenska two lovers parting in heartbroken silence they were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the lawyer the worst possible impression of the clients case wherein then lay the resemblance that made the young mans heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement it seemed to be in madame olenskas mysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities outside the daily run of experience she had hardly ever said a word to him to produce this impression but it was a part of her either a projection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something inherently dramatic passionate and unusual in herself archer had always been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a small part in shaping peoples lots compared with their innate tendency to have things happen to them this tendency he had felt from the first in madame olenska the quiet almost passive young woman struck him as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen no matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to avoid them the exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so thick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently passed unperceived it was precisely the odd absence of surprise in her that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very maelstrom the things she took for granted gave the measure of those she had rebelled against archer had left her with the conviction that count olenskis accusation was not unfounded the mysterious person who figured in his wifes past as the secretary had probably not been unrewarded for his share in her escape the conditions from which she had fled were intolerable past speaking of past believing she was young she was frightened she was desperatewhat more natural than that she should be grateful to her rescuer the pity was that her gratitude put her in the laws eyes and the worlds on a par with her abominable husband archer had made her understand this as he was bound to do he had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly new york on whose larger charity she had apparently counted was precisely the place where she could least hope for indulgence to have to make this fact plain to herand to witness her resigned acceptance of ithad been intolerably painful to him he felt himself drawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity as if her dumblyconfessed error had put her at his mercy humbling yet endearing her he was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret rather than to the cold scrutiny of mr letterblair or the embarrassed gaze of her family he immediately took it upon himself to assure them both that she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce basing her decision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the proceeding and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes from the unpleasantness she had spared them i was sure newland would manage it mrs welland had said proudly of her future soninlaw and old mrs mingott who had summoned him for a confidential interview had congratulated him on his cleverness and added impatiently silly goose i told her myself what nonsense it was wanting to pass herself off as ellen mingott and an old maid when she has the luck to be a married woman and a countess these incidents had made the memory of his last talk with madame olenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the parting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears and he stood up to leave the theatre in doing so he turned to the side of the house behind him and saw the lady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the beauforts lawrence lefferts and one or two other men he had not spoken with her alone since their evening together and had tried to avoid being with her in company but now their eyes met and as mrs beaufort recognised him at the same time and made her languid little gesture of invitation it was impossible not to go into the box beaufort and lefferts made way for him and after a few words with mrs beaufort who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk archer seated himself behind madame olenska there was no one else in the box but mr sillerton jackson who was telling mrs beaufort in a confidential undertone about mrs lemuel strutherss last sunday reception where some people reported that there had been dancing under cover of this circumstantial narrative to which mrs beaufort listened with her perfect smile and her head at just the right angle to be seen in profile from the stalls madame olenska turned and spoke in a low voice do you think she asked glancing toward the stage he will send her a bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning archer reddened and his heart gave a leap of surprise he had called only twice on madame olenska and each time he had sent her a box of yellow roses and each time without a card she had never before made any allusion to the flowers and he supposed she had never thought of him as the sender now her sudden recognition of the gift and her associating it with the tender leavetaking on the stage filled him with an agitated pleasure i was thinking of that tooi was going to leave the theatre in order to take the picture away with me he said to his surprise her colour rose reluctantly and duskily she looked down at the motherofpearl operaglass in her smoothly gloved hands and said after a pause what do you do while may is away i stick to my work he answered faintly annoyed by the question in obedience to a longestablished habit the wellands had left the previous week for st augustine where out of regard for the supposed susceptibility of mr wellands bronchial tubes they always spent the latter part of the winter mr welland was a mild and silent man with no opinions but with many habits with these habits none might interfere and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should always go with him on his annual journey to the south to preserve an unbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind he would not have known where his hairbrushes were or how to provide stamps for his letters if mrs welland had not been there to tell him as all the members of the family adored each other and as mr welland was the central object of their idolatry it never occurred to his wife and may to let him go to st augustine alone and his sons who were both in the law and could not leave new york during the winter always joined him for easter and travelled back with him it was impossible for archer to discuss the necessity of mays accompanying her father the reputation of the mingotts family physician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which mr welland had never had and his insistence on st augustine was therefore inflexible originally it had been intended that mays engagement should not be announced till her return from florida and the fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to alter mr wellands plans archer would have liked to join the travellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his betrothed but he too was bound by custom and conventions little arduous as his professional duties were he would have been convicted of frivolity by the whole mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a holiday in midwinter and he accepted mays departure with the resignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal constituents of married life he was conscious that madame olenska was looking at him under lowered lids i have done what you wishedwhat you advised she said abruptly ahim glad he returned embarrassed by her broaching the subject at such a moment i understandthat you were right she went on a little breathlessly but sometimes life is difficult perplexing i know and i wanted to tell you that i do feel you were right and that im grateful to you she ended lifting her operaglass quickly to her eyes as the door of the box opened and beauforts resonant voice broke in on them archer stood up and left the box and the theatre only the day before he had received a letter from may welland in which with characteristic candour she had asked him to be kind to ellen in their absence she likes you and admires you so muchand you know though she doesnt show it shes still very lonely and unhappy i dont think granny understands her or uncle lovell mingott either they really think shes much worldlier and fonder of society than she is and i can quite see that new york must seem dull to her though the family wont admit it i think shes been used to lots of things we havent got wonderful music and picture shows and celebritiesartists and authors and all the clever people you admire granny cant understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and clothesbut i can see that youre almost the only person in new york who can talk to her about what she really cares for his wise mayhow he had loved her for that letter but he had not meant to act on it he was too busy to begin with and he did not care as an engaged man to play too conspicuously the part of madame olenskas champion he had an idea that she knew how to take care of herself a good deal better than the ingenuous may imagined she had beaufort at her feet mr van der luyden hovering above her like a protecting deity and any number of candidates lawrence lefferts among them waiting their opportunity in the middle distance yet he never saw her or exchanged a word with her without feeling that after all mays ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination ellen olenska was lonely and she was unhappy as he came out into the lobby archer ran across his friend ned winsett the only one among what janey called his clever people with whom he cared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of club and chophouse banter he had caught sight across the house of winsetts shabby roundshouldered back and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the beaufort box the two men shook hands and winsett proposed a bock at a little german restaurant around the corner archer who was not in the mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there declined on the plea that he had work to do at home and winsett said oh well so have i for that matter and ill be the industrious apprentice too they strolled along together and presently winsett said look here what im really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of yourswith the beauforts wasnt she the one your friend lefferts seems so smitten by archer he could not have said why was slightly annoyed what the devil did ned winsett want with ellen olenskas name and above all why did he couple it with leffertss it was unlike winsett to manifest such curiosity but after all archer remembered he was a journalist its not for an interview i hope he laughed wellnot for the press just for myself winsett rejoined the fact is shes a neighbour of minequeer quarter for such a beauty to settle inand shes been awfully kind to my little boy who fell down her area chasing his kitten and gave himself a nasty cut she rushed in bareheaded carrying him in her arms with his knee all beautifully bandaged and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too dazzled to ask her name a pleasant glow dilated archers heart there was nothing extraordinary in the tale any woman would have done as much for a neighbours child but it was just like ellen he felt to have rushed in bareheaded carrying the boy in her arms and to have dazzled poor mrs winsett into forgetting to ask who she was that is the countess olenskaa granddaughter of old mrs mingotts whewa countess whistled ned winsett well i didnt know countesses were so neighbourly mingotts aint they would be if youd let them ah well it was their old interminable argument as to the obstinate unwillingness of the clever people to frequent the fashionable and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it i wonder winsett broke off how a countess happens to live in our slum because she doesnt care a hang about where she livesor about any of our little social signposts said archer with a secret pride in his own picture of her hmbeen in bigger places i suppose the other commented well heres my corner he slouched off across broadway and archer stood looking after him and musing on his last words ned winsett had those flashes of penetration they were the most interesting thing about him and always made archer wonder why they had allowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are still struggling archer had known that winsett had a wife and child but he had never seen them the two men always met at the century or at some haunt of journalists and theatrical people such as the restaurant where winsett had proposed to go for a bock he had given archer to understand that his wife was an invalid which might be true of the poor lady or might merely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes or in both winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social observances archer who dressed in the evening because he thought it cleaner and more comfortable to do so and who had never stopped to consider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in a modest budget regarded winsetts attitude as part of the boring bohemian pose that always made fashionable people who changed their clothes without talking about it and were not forever harping on the number of servants one kept seem so much simpler and less selfconscious than the others nevertheless he was always stimulated by winsett and whenever he caught sight of the journalists lean bearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner and carry him off for a long talk winsett was not a journalist by choice he was a pure man of letters untimely born in a world that had no need of letters but after publishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations of which one hundred and twenty copies were sold thirty given away and the balance eventually destroyed by the publishers as per contract to make room for more marketable material he had abandoned his real calling and taken a subeditorial job on a womens weekly where fashionplates and paper patterns alternated with new england lovestories and advertisements of temperance drinks on the subject of hearthfires as the paper was called he was inexhaustibly entertaining but beneath his fun lurked the sterile bitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up his conversation always made archer take the measure of his own life and feel how little it contained but winsetts after all contained still less and though their common fund of intellectual interests and curiosities made their talks exhilarating their exchange of views usually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism the fact is life isnt much a fit for either of us winsett had once said im down and out nothing to be done about it ive got only one ware to produce and theres no market for it here and wont be in my time but youre free and youre welloff why dont you get into touch theres only one way to do it to go into politics archer threw his head back and laughed there one saw at a flash the unbridgeable difference between men like winsett and the othersarchers kind every one in polite circles knew that in america a gentleman couldnt go into politics but since he could hardly put it in that way to winsett he answered evasively look at the career of the honest man in american politics they dont want us whos they why dont you all get together and be they yourselves archers laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile it was useless to prolong the discussion everybody knew the melancholy fate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal or state politics in new york the day was past when that sort of thing was possible the country was in possession of the bosses and the emigrant and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture culture yesif we had it but there are just a few little local patches dying out here and there for lack ofwell hoeing and crossfertilising the last remnants of the old european tradition that your forebears brought with them but youre in a pitiful little minority youve got no centre no competition no audience youre like the pictures on the walls of a deserted house the portrait of a gentleman youll never amount to anything any of you till you roll up your sleeves and get right down into the muck that or emigrate god if i could emigrate archer mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back to books where winsett if uncertain was always interesting emigrate as if a gentleman could abandon his own country one could no more do that than one could roll up ones sleeves and go down into the muck a gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained but you couldnt make a man like winsett see that and that was why the new york of literary clubs and exotic restaurants though a first shake made it seem more of a kaleidoscope turned out in the end to be a smaller box with a more monotonous pattern than the assembled atoms of fifth avenue the next morning archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses in consequence of this search he arrived late at the office perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life why should he not be at that moment on the sands of st augustine with may welland no one was deceived by his pretense of professional activity in oldfashioned legal firms like that of which mr letterblair was the head and which were mainly engaged in the management of large estates and conservative investments there were always two or three young men fairly welloff and without professional ambition who for a certain number of hours of each day sat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks or simply reading the newspapers though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an occupation the crude fact of moneymaking was still regarded as derogatory and the law being a profession was accounted a more gentlemanly pursuit than business but none of these young men had much hope of really advancing in his profession or any earnest desire to do so and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was already perceptibly spreading it made archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too he had to be sure other tastes and interests he spent his vacations in european travel cultivated the clever people may spoke of and generally tried to keep up as he had somewhat wistfully put it to madame olenska but once he was married what would become of this narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived he had seen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream though perhaps less ardently and who had gradually sunk into the placid and luxurious routine of their elders from the office he sent a note by messenger to madame olenska asking if he might call that afternoon and begging her to let him find a reply at his club but at the club he found nothing nor did he receive any letter the following day this unexpected silence mortified him beyond reason and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of yellow roses behind a florists windowpane he left it there it was only on the third morning that he received a line by post from the countess olenska to his surprise it was dated from skuytercliff whither the van der luydens had promptly retreated after putting the duke on board his steamer i ran away the writer began abruptly without the usual preliminaries the day after i saw you at the play and these kind friends have taken me in i wanted to be quiet and think things over you were right in telling me how kind they were i feel myself so safe here i wish that you were with us she ended with a conventional yours sincerely and without any allusion to the date of her return the tone of the note surprised the young man what was madame olenska running away from and why did she feel the need to be safe his first thought was of some dark menace from abroad then he reflected that he did not know her epistolary style and that it might run to picturesque exaggeration women always exaggerated and moreover she was not wholly at her ease in english which she often spoke as if she were translating from the french je me suis evadee put in that way the opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have wanted to escape from a boring round of engagements which was very likely true for he judged her to be capricious and easily wearied of the pleasure of the moment it amused him to think of the van der luydens having carried her off to skuytercliff on a second visit and this time for an indefinite period the doors of skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to visitors and a chilly weekend was the most ever offered to the few thus privileged but archer had seen on his last visit to paris the delicious play of labiche le voyage de m perrichon and he remembered m perrichons dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the young man whom he had pulled out of the glacier the van der luydens had rescued madame olenska from a doom almost as icy and though there were many other reasons for being attracted to her archer knew that beneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on rescuing her he felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away and almost immediately remembered that only the day before he had refused an invitation to spend the following sunday with the reggie chiverses at their house on the hudson a few miles below skuytercliff he had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at highbank with coasting iceboating sleighing long tramps in the snow and a general flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes he had just received a box of new books from his london bookseller and had preferred the prospect of a quiet sunday at home with his spoils but he now went into the club writingroom wrote a hurried telegram and told the servant to send it immediately he knew that mrs reggie didnt object to her visitors suddenly changing their minds and that there was always a room to spare in her elastic house newland archer arrived at the chiverses on friday evening and on saturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a weekend at highbank in the morning he had a spin in the iceboat with his hostess and a few of the hardier guests in the afternoon he went over the farm with reggie and listened in the elaborately appointed stables to long and impressive disquisitions on the horse after tea he talked in a corner of the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself brokenhearted when his engagement was announced but was now eager to tell him of her own matrimonial hopes and finally about midnight he assisted in putting a goldfish in one visitors bed dressed up a burglar in the bathroom of a nervous aunt and saw in the small hours by joining in a pillowfight that ranged from the nurseries to the basement but on sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter and drove over to skuytercliff people had always been told that the house at skuytercliff was an italian villa those who had never been to italy believed it so did some who had the house had been built by mr van der luyden in his youth on his return from the grand tour and in anticipation of his approaching marriage with miss louisa dagonet it was a large square wooden structure with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and white a corinthian portico and fluted pilasters between the windows from the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by balustrades and urns descended in the steelengraving style to a small irregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers to the right and left the famous weedless lawns studded with specimen trees each of a different variety rolled away to long ranges of grass crested with elaborate castiron ornaments and below in a hollow lay the fourroomed stone house which the first patroon had built on the land granted him in 1612 against the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the italian villa loomed up rather grimly even in summer it kept its distance and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than thirty feet from its awful front now as archer rang the bell the long tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum and the surprise of the butler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he had been summoned from his final sleep happily archer was of the family and therefore irregular though his arrival was entitled to be informed that the countess olenska was out having driven to afternoon service with mrs van der luyden exactly three quarters of an hour earlier mr van der luyden the butler continued is in sir but my impression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading yesterdays evening post i heard him say sir on his return from church this morning that he intended to look through the evening post after luncheon if you like sir i might go to the library door and listen but archer thanking him said that he would go and meet the ladies and the butler obviously relieved closed the door on him majestically a groom took the cutter to the stables and archer struck through the park to the highroad the village of skuytercliff was only a mile and a half away but he knew that mrs van der luyden never walked and that he must keep to the road to meet the carriage presently however coming down a footpath that crossed the highway he caught sight of a slight figure in a red cloak with a big dog running ahead he hurried forward and madame olenska stopped short with a smile of welcome ah youve come she said and drew her hand from her muff the red cloak made her look gay and vivid like the ellen mingott of old days and he laughed as he took her hand and answered i came to see what you were running away from her face clouded over but she answered ah wellyou will see presently the answer puzzled him whydo you mean that youve been overtaken she shrugged her shoulders with a little movement like nastasias and rejoined in a lighter tone shall we walk on im so cold after the sermon and what does it matter now youre here to protect me the blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak ellenwhat is it you must tell me oh presentlylets run a race first my feet are freezing to the ground she cried and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the snow the dog leaping about her with challenging barks for a moment archer stood watching his gaze delighted by the flash of the red meteor against the snow then he started after her and they met panting and laughing at a wicket that led into the park she looked up at him and smiled i knew youd come that shows you wanted me to he returned with a disproportionate joy in their nonsense the white glitter of the trees filled the air with its own mysterious brightness and as they walked on over the snow the ground seemed to sing under their feet where did you come from madame olenska asked he told her and added it was because i got your note after a pause she said with a just perceptible chill in her voice may asked you to take care of me i didnt need any asking you meanim so evidently helpless and defenceless what a poor thing you must all think me but women here seem notseem never to feel the need any more than the blessed in heaven he lowered his voice to ask what sort of a need ah dont ask me i dont speak your language she retorted petulantly the answer smote him like a blow and he stood still in the path looking down at her what did i come for if i dont speak yours oh my friend she laid her hand lightly on his arm and he pleaded earnestly ellenwhy wont you tell me whats happened she shrugged again does anything ever happen in heaven he was silent and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a word finally she said i will tell youbut where where where one cant be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house with all the doors wide open and always a servant bringing tea or a log for the fire or the newspaper is there nowhere in an american house where one may be by ones self youre so shy and yet youre so public i always feel as if i were in the convent againor on the stage before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds ah you dont like us archer exclaimed they were walking past the house of the old patroon with its squat walls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central chimney the shutters stood wide and through one of the newlywashed windows archer caught the light of a fire whythe house is open he said she stood still no only for today at least i wanted to see it and mr van der luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened so that we might stop there on the way back from church this morning she ran up the steps and tried the door its still unlockedwhat luck come in and we can have a quiet talk mrs van der luyden has driven over to see her old aunts at rhinebeck and we shant be missed at the house for another hour he followed her into the narrow passage his spirits which had dropped at her last words rose with an irrational leap the homely little house stood there its panels and brasses shining in the firelight as if magically created to receive them a big bed of embers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney under an iron pot hung from an ancient crane rushbottomed armchairs faced each other across the tiled hearth and rows of delft plates stood on shelves against the walls archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers madame olenska dropping her cloak sat down in one of the chairs archer leaned against the chimney and looked at her youre laughing now but when you wrote me you were unhappy he said yes she paused but i cant feel unhappy when youre here i shant be here long he rejoined his lips stiffening with the effort to say just so much and no more no i know but im improvident i live in the moment when im happy the words stole through him like a temptation and to close his senses to it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black treeboles against the snow but it was as if she too had shifted her place and he still saw her between himself and the trees drooping over the fire with her indolent smile archers heart was beating insubordinately what if it were from him that she had been running away and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone together in this secret room ellen if im really a help to youif you really wanted me to cometell me whats wrong tell me what it is youre running away from he insisted he spoke without shifting his position without even turning to look at her if the thing was to happen it was to happen in this way with the whole width of the room between them and his eyes still fixed on the outer snow for a long moment she was silent and in that moment archer imagined her almost heard her stealing up behind him to throw her light arms about his neck while he waited soul and body throbbing with the miracle to come his eyes mechanically received the image of a heavilycoated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing along the path to the house the man was julius beaufort ah archer cried bursting into a laugh madame olenska had sprung up and moved to his side slipping her hand into his but after a glance through the window her face paled and she shrank back so that was it archer said derisively i didnt know he was here madame olenska murmured her hand still clung to archers but he drew away from her and walking out into the passage threw open the door of the house hallo beaufortthis way madame olenska was expecting you he said during his journey back to new york the next morning archer relived with a fatiguing vividness his last moments at skuytercliff beaufort though clearly annoyed at finding him with madame olenska had as usual carried off the situation highhandedly his way of ignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them if they were sensitive to it a feeling of invisibility of nonexistence archer as the three strolled back through the park was aware of this odd sense of disembodiment and humbling as it was to his vanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved beaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance but he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes it was fairly clear that madame olenska had not known that he was coming though her words to archer had hinted at the possibility at any rate she had evidently not told him where she was going when she left new york and her unexplained departure had exasperated him the ostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery the very night before of a perfect little house not in the market which was really just the thing for her but would be snapped up instantly if she didnt take it and he was loud in mockreproaches for the dance she had led him in running away just as he had found it if only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit nearer perfection i might have told you all this from town and been toasting my toes before the club fire at this minute instead of tramping after you through the snow he grumbled disguising a real irritation under the pretence of it and at this opening madame olenska twisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one day actually converse with each other from street to street or evenincredible dreamfrom one town to another this struck from all three allusions to edgar poe and jules verne and such platitudes as naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are talking against time and dealing with a new invention in which it would seem ingenuous to believe too soon and the question of the telephone carried them safely back to the big house mrs van der luyden had not yet returned and archer took his leave and walked off to fetch the cutter while beaufort followed the countess olenska indoors it was probable that little as the van der luydens encouraged unannounced visits he could count on being asked to dine and sent back to the station to catch the nine oclock train but more than that he would certainly not get for it would be inconceivable to his hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to spend the night and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with whom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as beaufort beaufort knew all this and must have foreseen it and his taking the long journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience he was undeniably in pursuit of the countess olenska and beaufort had only one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women his dull and childless home had long since palled on him and in addition to more permanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in his own set this was the man from whom madame olenska was avowedly flying the question was whether she had fled because his importunities displeased her or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist them unless indeed all her talk of flight had been a blind and her departure no more than a manoeuvre archer did not really believe this little as he had actually seen of madame olenska he was beginning to think that he could read her face and if not her face her voice and both had betrayed annoyance and even dismay at beauforts sudden appearance but after all if this were the case was it not worse than if she had left new york for the express purpose of meeting him if she had done that she ceased to be an object of interest she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of dissemblers a woman engaged in a love affair with beaufort classed herself irretrievably no it was worse a thousand times if judging beaufort and probably despising him she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her his habit of two continents and two societies his familiar association with artists and actors and people generally in the worlds eye and his careless contempt for local prejudices beaufort was vulgar he was uneducated he was purseproud but the circumstances of his life and a certain native shrewdness made him better worth talking to than many men morally and socially his betters whose horizon was bounded by the battery and the central park how should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it madame olenska in a burst of irritation had said to archer that he and she did not talk the same language and the young man knew that in some respects this was true but beaufort understood every turn of her dialect and spoke it fluently his view of life his tone his attitude were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in count olenskis letter this might seem to be to his disadvantage with count olenskis wife but archer was too intelligent to think that a young woman like ellen olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that reminded her of her past she might believe herself wholly in revolt against it but what had charmed her in it would still charm her even though it were against her will thus with a painful impartiality did the young man make out the case for beaufort and for beauforts victim a longing to enlighten her was strong in him and there were moments when he imagined that all she asked was to be enlightened that evening he unpacked his books from london the box was full of things he had been waiting for impatiently a new volume of herbert spencer another collection of the prolific alphonse daudets brilliant tales and a novel called middlemarch as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews he had declined three dinner invitations in favour of this feast but though he turned the pages with the sensuous joy of the booklover he did not know what he was reading and one book after another dropped from his hand suddenly among them he lit on a small volume of verse which he had ordered because the name had attracted him the house of life he took it up and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he had ever breathed in books so warm so rich and yet so ineffably tender that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary of human passions all through the night he pursued through those enchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of ellen olenska but when he woke the next morning and looked out at the brownstone houses across the street and thought of his desk in mr letterblairs office and the family pew in grace church his hour in the park of skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability as the visions of the night mercy how pale you look newland janey commented over the coffeecups at breakfast and his mother added newland dear ive noticed lately that youve been coughing i do hope youre not letting yourself be overworked for it was the conviction of both ladies that under the iron despotism of his senior partners the young mans life was spent in the most exhausting professional laboursand he had never thought it necessary to undeceive them the next two or three days dragged by heavily the taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth and there were moments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future he heard nothing of the countess olenska or of the perfect little house and though he met beaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the whisttables it was not till the fourth evening that he found a note awaiting him on his return home come late tomorrow i must explain to you ellen these were the only words it contained the young man who was dining out thrust the note into his pocket smiling a little at the frenchness of the to you after dinner he went to a play and it was not until his return home after midnight that he drew madame olenskas missive out again and reread it slowly a number of times there were several ways of answering it and he gave considerable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated night that on which when morning came he finally decided was to pitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was leaving that very afternoon for st augustine when archer walked down the sandy main street of st augustine to the house which had been pointed out to him as mr wellands and saw may welland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair he wondered why he had waited so long to come here was the truth here was reality here was the life that belonged to him and he who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary restraints had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what people might think of his stealing a holiday her first exclamation was newlandhas anything happened and it occurred to him that it would have been more feminine if she had instantly read in his eyes why he had come but when he answered yesi found i had to see you her happy blushes took the chill from her surprise and he saw how easily he would be forgiven and how soon even mr letterblairs mild disapproval would be smiled away by a tolerant family early as it was the main street was no place for any but formal greetings and archer longed to be alone with may and to pour out all his tenderness and his impatience it still lacked an hour to the late welland breakfasttime and instead of asking him to come in she proposed that they should walk out to an old orangegarden beyond the town she had just been for a row on the river and the sun that netted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its meshes across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered like silver wire and her eyes too looked lighter almost pale in their youthful limpidity as she walked beside archer with her long swinging gait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete to archers strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of the blue sky and the lazy river they sat down on a bench under the orangetrees and he put his arm about her and kissed her it was like drinking at a cold spring with the sun on it but his pressure may have been more vehement than he had intended for the blood rose to her face and she drew back as if he had startled her what is it he asked smiling and she looked at him with surprise and answered nothing a slight embarrassment fell on them and her hand slipped out of his it was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for their fugitive embrace in the beaufort conservatory and he saw that she was disturbed and shaken out of her cool boyish composure tell me what you do all day he said crossing his arms under his tiltedback head and pushing his hat forward to screen the sundazzle to let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of carrying on his own independent train of thought and he sat listening to her simple chronicle of swimming sailing and riding varied by an occasional dance at the primitive inn when a manofwar came in a few pleasant people from philadelphia and baltimore were picknicking at the inn and the selfridge merrys had come down for three weeks because kate merry had had bronchitis they were planning to lay out a lawn tennis court on the sands but no one but kate and may had racquets and most of the people had not even heard of the game all this kept her very busy and she had not had time to do more than look at the little vellum book that archer had sent her the week before the sonnets from the portuguese but she was learning by heart how they brought the good news from ghent to aix because it was one of the first things he had ever read to her and it amused her to be able to tell him that kate merry had never even heard of a poet called robert browning presently she started up exclaiming that they would be late for breakfast and they hurried back to the tumbledown house with its pointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where the wellands were installed for the winter mr wellands sensitive domesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel and at immense expense and in face of almost insuperable difficulties mrs welland was obliged year after year to improvise an establishment partly made up of discontented new york servants and partly drawn from the local african supply the doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home otherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any good she explained winter after winter to the sympathising philadelphians and baltimoreans and mr welland beaming across a breakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies was presently saying to archer you see my dear fellow we campwe literally camp i tell my wife and may that i want to teach them how to rough it mr and mrs welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by the young mans sudden arrival but it had occurred to him to explain that he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold and this seemed to mr welland an allsufficient reason for abandoning any duty you cant be too careful especially toward spring he said heaping his plate with strawcoloured griddlecakes and drowning them in golden syrup if id only been as prudent at your age may would have been dancing at the assemblies now instead of spending her winters in a wilderness with an old invalid oh but i love it here papa you know i do if only newland could stay i should like it a thousand times better than new york newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold said mrs welland indulgently and the young man laughed and said he supposed there was such a thing as ones profession he managed however after an exchange of telegrams with the firm to make his cold last a week and it shed an ironic light on the situation to know that mr letterblairs indulgence was partly due to the satisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had settled the troublesome matter of the olenski divorce mr letterblair had let mrs welland know that mr archer had rendered an invaluable service to the whole family and that old mrs manson mingott had been particularly pleased and one day when may had gone for a drive with her father in the only vehicle the place produced mrs welland took occasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughters presence im afraid ellens ideas are not at all like ours she was barely eighteen when medora manson took her back to europeyou remember the excitement when she appeared in black at her comingout ball another of medoras fadsreally this time it was almost prophetic that must have been at least twelve years ago and since then ellen has never been to america no wonder she is completely europeanised but european society is not given to divorce countess olenska thought she would be conforming to american ideas in asking for her freedom it was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since he had left skuytercliff and he felt the colour rise to his cheek mrs welland smiled compassionately that is just like the extraordinary things that foreigners invent about us they think we dine at two oclock and countenance divorce that is why it seems to me so foolish to entertain them when they come to new york they accept our hospitality and then they go home and repeat the same stupid stories archer made no comment on this and mrs welland continued but we do most thoroughly appreciate your persuading ellen to give up the idea her grandmother and her uncle lovell could do nothing with her both of them have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your influencein fact she said so to her grandmother she has an unbounded admiration for you poor ellenshe was always a wayward child i wonder what her fate will be what weve all contrived to make it he felt like answering if youd all of you rather she should be beauforts mistress than some decent fellows wife youve certainly gone the right way about it he wondered what mrs welland would have said if he had uttered the words instead of merely thinking them he could picture the sudden decomposure of her firm placid features to which a lifelong mastery over trifles had given an air of factitious authority traces still lingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughters and he asked himself if mays face was doomed to thicken into the same middleaged image of invincible innocence ah no he did not want may to have that kind of innocence the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience i verily believe mrs welland continued that if the horrible business had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husbands deathblow i dont know any of the details i only ask not to as i told poor ellen when she tried to talk to me about it having an invalid to care for i have to keep my mind bright and happy but mr welland was terribly upset he had a slight temperature every morning while we were waiting to hear what had been decided it was the horror of his girls learning that such things were possiblebut of course dear newland you felt that too we all knew that you were thinking of may im always thinking of may the young man rejoined rising to cut short the conversation he had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with mrs welland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage but he could think of no arguments that would move her and with a sense of relief he saw mr welland and may driving up to the door his only hope was to plead again with may and on the day before his departure he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the spanish mission the background lent itself to allusions to european scenes and may who was looking her loveliest under a widebrimmed hat that cast a shadow of mystery over her tooclear eyes kindled into eagerness as he spoke of granada and the alhambra we might be seeing it all this springeven the easter ceremonies at seville he urged exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger concession easter in seville and it will be lent next week she laughed why shouldnt we be married in lent he rejoined but she looked so shocked that he saw his mistake of course i didnt mean that dearest but soon after easterso that we could sail at the end of april i know i could arrange it at the office she smiled dreamily upon the possibility but he perceived that to dream of it sufficed her it was like hearing him read aloud out of his poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in real life oh do go on newland i do love your descriptions but why should they be only descriptions why shouldnt we make them real we shall dearest of course next year her voice lingered over it dont you want them to be real sooner cant i persuade you to break away now she bowed her head vanishing from him under her conniving hatbrim why should we dream away another year look at me dear dont you understand how i want you for my wife for a moment she remained motionless then she raised on him eyes of such despairing dearness that he halfreleased her waist from his hold but suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably im not sure if i do understand she said is itis it because youre not certain of continuing to care for me archer sprang up from his seat my godperhapsi dont know he broke out angrily may welland rose also as they faced each other she seemed to grow in womanly stature and dignity both were silent for a moment as if dismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words then she said in a low voice if that is itis there some one else some one elsebetween you and me he echoed her words slowly as though they were only halfintelligible and he wanted time to repeat the question to himself she seemed to catch the uncertainty of his voice for she went on in a deepening tone let us talk frankly newland sometimes ive felt a difference in you especially since our engagement has been announced dearwhat madness he recovered himself to exclaim she met his protest with a faint smile if it is it wont hurt us to talk about it she paused and added lifting her head with one of her noble movements or even if its true why shouldnt we speak of it you might so easily have made a mistake he lowered his head staring at the black leafpattern on the sunny path at their feet mistakes are always easy to make but if i had made one of the kind you suggest is it likely that i should be imploring you to hasten our marriage she looked downward too disturbing the pattern with the point of her sunshade while she struggled for expression yes she said at length you might wantonce for allto settle the question its one way her quiet lucidity startled him but did not mislead him into thinking her insensible under her hatbrim he saw the pallor of her profile and a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips well he questioned sitting down on the bench and looking up at her with a frown that he tried to make playful she dropped back into her seat and went on you mustnt think that a girl knows as little as her parents imagine one hears and one noticesone has ones feelings and ideas and of course long before you told me that you cared for me id known that there was some one else you were interested in every one was talking about it two years ago at newport and once i saw you sitting together on the verandah at a danceand when she came back into the house her face was sad and i felt sorry for her i remembered it afterward when we were engaged her voice had sunk almost to a whisper and she sat clasping and unclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade the young man laid his upon them with a gentle pressure his heart dilated with an inexpressible relief my dear childwas that it if you only knew the truth she raised her head quickly then there is a truth i dont know he kept his hand over hers i meant the truth about the old story you speak of but thats what i want to know newlandwhat i ought to know i couldnt have my happiness made out of a wrongan unfairnessto somebody else and i want to believe that it would be the same with you what sort of a life could we build on such foundations her face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like bowing himself down at her feet ive wanted to say this for a long time she went on ive wanted to tell you that when two people really love each other i understand that there may be situations which make it right that they shouldshould go against public opinion and if you feel yourself in any way pledged pledged to the person weve spoken of and if there is any way any way in which you can fulfill your pledge even by her getting a divorce newland dont give her up because of me his surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode so remote and so completely of the past as his loveaffair with mrs thorley rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view there was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox and if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in wonder at the prodigy of the wellands daughter urging him to marry his former mistress but he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the precipice they had skirted and full of a new awe at the mystery of younggirlhood for a moment he could not speak then he said there is no pledgeno obligation whateverof the kind you think such cases dont alwayspresent themselves quite as simply as but thats no matter i love your generosity because i feel as you do about those things i feel that each case must be judged individually on its own merits irrespective of stupid conventionalities i mean each womans right to her liberty he pulled himself up startled by the turn his thoughts had taken and went on looking at her with a smile since you understand so many things dearest cant you go a little farther and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another form of the same foolish conventionalities if theres no one and nothing between us isnt that an argument for marrying quickly rather than for more delay she flushed with joy and lifted her face to his as he bent to it he saw that her eyes were full of happy tears but in another moment she seemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and timorous girlhood and he understood that her courage and initiative were all for others and that she had none for herself it was evident that the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied composure betrayed and that at his first word of reassurance she had dropped back into the usual as a tooadventurous child takes refuge in its mothers arms archer had no heart to go on pleading with her he was too much disappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one deep look at him from her transparent eyes may seemed to be aware of his disappointment but without knowing how to alleviate it and they stood up and walked silently home your cousin the countess called on mother while you were away janey archer announced to her brother on the evening of his return the young man who was dining alone with his mother and sister glanced up in surprise and saw mrs archers gaze demurely bent on her plate mrs archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for being forgotten by it and newland guessed that she was slightly annoyed that he should be surprised by madame olenskas visit she had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons and a tiny green monkey muff i never saw her so stylishly dressed janey continued she came alone early on sunday afternoon luckily the fire was lit in the drawingroom she had one of those new cardcases she said she wanted to know us because youd been so good to her newland laughed madame olenska always takes that tone about her friends shes very happy at being among her own people again yes so she told us said mrs archer i must say she seems thankful to be here i hope you liked her mother mrs archer drew her lips together she certainly lays herself out to please even when she is calling on an old lady mother doesnt think her simple janey interjected her eyes screwed upon her brothers face its just my oldfashioned feeling dear may is my ideal said mrs archer ah said her son theyre not alike archer had left st augustine charged with many messages for old mrs mingott and a day or two after his return to town he called on her the old lady received him with unusual warmth she was grateful to him for persuading the countess olenska to give up the idea of a divorce and when he told her that he had deserted the office without leave and rushed down to st augustine simply because he wanted to see may she gave an adipose chuckle and patted his knee with her puffball hand ah ahso you kicked over the traces did you and i suppose augusta and welland pulled long faces and behaved as if the end of the world had come but little mayshe knew better ill be bound i hoped she did but after all she wouldnt agree to what id gone down to ask for wouldnt she indeed and what was that i wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in april whats the use of our wasting another year mrs manson mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic prudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids ask mamma i supposethe usual story ah these mingottsall alike born in a rut and you cant root em out of it when i built this house youd have thought i was moving to california nobody ever had built above fortieth streetno says i nor above the battery either before christopher columbus discovered america no no not one of them wants to be different theyre as scared of it as the smallpox ah my dear mr archer i thank my stars im nothing but a vulgar spicer but theres not one of my own children that takes after me but my little ellen she broke off still twinkling at him and asked with the casual irrelevance of old age now why in the world didnt you marry my little ellen archer laughed for one thing she wasnt there to be married noto be sure mores the pity and now its too late her life is finished she spoke with the coldblooded complacency of the aged throwing earth into the grave of young hopes the young mans heart grew chill and he said hurriedly cant i persuade you to use your influence with the wellands mrs mingott i wasnt made for long engagements old catherine beamed on him approvingly no i can see that youve got a quick eye when you were a little boy ive no doubt you liked to be helped first she threw back her head with a laugh that made her chins ripple like little waves ah heres my ellen now she exclaimed as the portieres parted behind her madame olenska came forward with a smile her face looked vivid and happy and she held out her hand gaily to archer while she stooped to her grandmothers kiss i was just saying to him my dear now why didnt you marry my little ellen madame olenska looked at archer still smiling and what did he answer oh my darling i leave you to find that out hes been down to florida to see his sweetheart yes i know she still looked at him i went to see your mother to ask where youd gone i sent a note that you never answered and i was afraid you were ill he muttered something about leaving unexpectedly in a great hurry and having intended to write to her from st augustine and of course once you were there you never thought of me again she continued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied assumption of indifference if she still needs me shes determined not to let me see it he thought stung by her manner he wanted to thank her for having been to see his mother but under the ancestresss malicious eye he felt himself tonguetied and constrained look at himin such hot haste to get married that he took french leave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees thats something like a loverthats the way handsome bob spicer carried off my poor mother and then got tired of her before i was weanedthough they only had to wait eight months for me but thereyoure not a spicer young man luckily for you and for may its only my poor ellen that has kept any of their wicked blood the rest of them are all model mingotts cried the old lady scornfully archer was aware that madame olenska who had seated herself at her grandmothers side was still thoughtfully scrutinising him the gaiety had faded from her eyes and she said with great gentleness surely granny we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes archer rose to go and as his hand met madame olenskas he felt that she was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter when can i see you he asked as she walked with him to the door of the room whenever you like but it must be soon if you want to see the little house again i am moving next week a pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the lowstudded drawingroom few as they had been they were thick with memories tomorrow evening she nodded tomorrow yes but early im going out the next day was a sunday and if she were going out on a sunday evening it could of course be only to mrs lemuel strutherss he felt a slight movement of annoyance not so much at her going there for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van der luydens but because it was the kind of house at which she was sure to meet beaufort where she must have known beforehand that she would meet himand where she was probably going for that purpose very well tomorrow evening he repeated inwardly resolved that he would not go early and that by reaching her door late he would either prevent her from going to mrs strutherss or else arrive after she had startedwhich all things considered would no doubt be the simplest solution it was only halfpast eight after all when he rang the bell under the wisteria not as late as he had intended by half an hourbut a singular restlessness had driven him to her door he reflected however that mrs strutherss sunday evenings were not like a ball and that her guests as if to minimise their delinquency usually went early the one thing he had not counted on in entering madame olenskas hall was to find hats and overcoats there why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine on a closer inspection of the garments besides which nastasia was laying his own his resentment gave way to curiosity the overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had ever seen under a polite roof and it took but a glance to assure himself that neither of them belonged to julius beaufort one was a shaggy yellow ulster of reachmedown cut the other a very old and rusty cloak with a capesomething like what the french called a macfarlane this garment which appeared to be made for a person of prodigious size had evidently seen long and hard wear and its greenishblack folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of prolonged sessions against barroom walls on it lay a ragged grey scarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape archer raised his eyebrows enquiringly at nastasia who raised hers in return with a fatalistic gia as she threw open the drawingroom door the young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room then with surprise he discovered another lady standing by the fire this lady who was long lean and loosely put together was clad in raiment intricately looped and fringed with plaids and stripes and bands of plain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing her hair which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading was surmounted by a spanish comb and black lace scarf and silk mittens visibly darned covered her rheumatic hands beside her in a cloud of cigarsmoke stood the owners of the two overcoats both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken off since morning in one of the two archer to his surprise recognised ned winsett the other and older who was unknown to him and whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the macfarlane had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair and moved his arms with large pawing gestures as though he were distributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude these three persons stood together on the hearthrug their eyes fixed on an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses with a knot of purple pansies at their base that lay on the sofa where madame olenska usually sat what they must have cost at this seasonthough of course its the sentiment one cares about the lady was saying in a sighing staccato as archer came in the three turned with surprise at his appearance and the lady advancing held out her hand dear mr archeralmost my cousin newland she said i am the marchioness manson archer bowed and she continued my ellen has taken me in for a few days i came from cuba where i have been spending the winter with spanish friendssuch delightful distinguished people the highest nobility of old castilehow i wish you could know them but i was called away by our dear great friend here dr carver you dont know dr agathon carver founder of the valley of love community dr carver inclined his leonine head and the marchioness continued ah new yorknew yorkhow little the life of the spirit has reached it but i see you do know mr winsett oh yesi reached him some time ago but not by that route winsett said with his dry smile the marchioness shook her head reprovingly how do you know mr winsett the spirit bloweth where it listeth listoh list interjected dr carver in a stentorian murmur but do sit down mr archer we four have been having a delightful little dinner together and my child has gone up to dress she expects you she will be down in a moment we were just admiring these marvellous flowers which will surprise her when she reappears winsett remained on his feet im afraid i must be off please tell madame olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our street this house has been an oasis ah but she wont abandon you poetry and art are the breath of life to her it is poetry you write mr winsett well no but i sometimes read it said winsett including the group in a general nod and slipping out of the room a caustic spiritun peu sauvage but so witty dr carver you do think him witty i never think of wit said dr carver severely ahahyou never think of wit how merciless he is to us weak mortals mr archer but he lives only in the life of the spirit and tonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently at mrs blenkers dr carver would there be time before you start for the blenkers to explain to mr archer your illuminating discovery of the direct contact but no i see it is nearly nine oclock and we have no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message dr carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion but having compared his ponderous gold timepiece with madame olenskas little travellingclock he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for departure i shall see you later dear friend he suggested to the marchioness who replied with a smile as soon as ellens carriage comes i will join you i do hope the lecture wont have begun dr carver looked thoughtfully at archer perhaps if this young gentleman is interested in my experiences mrs blenker might allow you to bring him with you oh dear friend if it were possiblei am sure she would be too happy but i fear my ellen counts on mr archer herself that said dr carver is unfortunatebut here is my card he handed it to archer who read on it in gothic characters agathon carver the valley of love kittasquattamy n y dr carver bowed himself out and mrs manson with a sigh that might have been either of regret or relief again waved archer to a seat ellen will be down in a moment and before she comes i am so glad of this quiet moment with you archer murmured his pleasure at their meeting and the marchioness continued in her low sighing accents i know everything dear mr archermy child has told me all you have done for her your wise advice your courageous firmnessthank heaven it was not too late the young man listened with considerable embarrassment was there any one he wondered to whom madame olenska had not proclaimed his intervention in her private affairs madame olenska exaggerates i simply gave her a legal opinion as she asked me to ah but in doing itin doing it you were the unconscious instrument ofofwhat word have we moderns for providence mr archer cried the lady tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids mysteriously little did you know that at that very moment i was being appealed to being approached in factfrom the other side of the atlantic she glanced over her shoulder as though fearful of being overheard and then drawing her chair nearer and raising a tiny ivory fan to her lips breathed behind it by the count himselfmy poor mad foolish olenski who asks only to take her back on her own terms good god archer exclaimed springing up you are horrified yes of course i understand i dont defend poor stanislas though he has always called me his best friend he does not defend himselfhe casts himself at her feet in my person she tapped her emaciated bosom i have his letter here a letterhas madame olenska seen it archer stammered his brain whirling with the shock of the announcement the marchioness manson shook her head softly timetime i must have time i know my ellenhaughty intractable shall i say just a shade unforgiving but good heavens to forgive is one thing to go back into that hell ah yes the marchioness acquiesced so she describes itmy sensitive child but on the material side mr archer if one may stoop to consider such things do you know what she is giving up those roses there on the sofaacres like them under glass and in the open in his matchless terraced gardens at nice jewelshistoric pearls the sobieski emeraldssablesbut she cares nothing for all these art and beauty those she does care for she lives for as i always have and those also surrounded her pictures priceless furniture music brilliant conversationah that my dear young man if youll excuse me is what youve no conception of here and she had it all and the homage of the greatest she tells me she is not thought handsome in new yorkgood heavens her portrait has been painted nine times the greatest artists in europe have begged for the privilege are these things nothing and the remorse of an adoring husband as the marchioness manson rose to her climax her face assumed an expression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved archers mirth had he not been numb with amazement he would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first sight of poor medora manson would have been in the guise of a messenger of satan but he was in no mood for laughing now and she seemed to him to come straight out of the hell from which ellen olenska had just escaped she knows nothing yetof all this he asked abruptly mrs manson laid a purple finger on her lips nothing directlybut does she suspect who can tell the truth is mr archer i have been waiting to see you from the moment i heard of the firm stand you had taken and of your influence over her i hoped it might be possible to count on your supportto convince you that she ought to go back i would rather see her dead cried the young man violently ah the marchioness murmured without visible resentment for a while she sat in her armchair opening and shutting the absurd ivory fan between her mittened fingers but suddenly she lifted her head and listened here she comes she said in a rapid whisper and then pointing to the bouquet on the sofa am i to understand that you prefer that mr archer after all marriage is marriage and my niece is still a wife what are you two plotting together aunt medora madame olenska cried as she came into the room she was dressed as if for a ball everything about her shimmered and glimmered softly as if her dress had been woven out of candlebeams and she carried her head high like a pretty woman challenging a roomful of rivals we were saying my dear that here was something beautiful to surprise you with mrs manson rejoined rising to her feet and pointing archly to the flowers madame olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet her colour did not change but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like summer lightning ah she exclaimed in a shrill voice that the young man had never heard who is ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet why a bouquet and why tonight of all nights i am not going to a ball i am not a girl engaged to be married but some people are always ridiculous she turned back to the door opened it and called out nastasia the ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared and archer heard madame olenska say in an italian that she seemed to pronounce with intentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it herethrow this into the dustbin and then as nastasia stared protestingly but noits not the fault of the poor flowers tell the boy to carry them to the house three doors away the house of mr winsett the dark gentleman who dined here his wife is illthey may give her pleasure the boy is out you say then my dear one run yourself here put my cloak over you and fly i want the thing out of the house immediately and as you live dont say they come from me she flung her velvet opera cloak over the maids shoulders and turned back into the drawingroom shutting the door sharply her bosom was rising high under its lace and for a moment archer thought she was about to cry but she burst into a laugh instead and looking from the marchioness to archer asked abruptly and you twohave you made friends its for mr archer to say darling he has waited patiently while you were dressing yesi gave you time enough my hair wouldnt go madame olenska said raising her hand to the heapedup curls of her chignon but that reminds me i see dr carver is gone and youll be late at the blenkers mr archer will you put my aunt in the carriage she followed the marchioness into the hall saw her fitted into a miscellaneous heap of overshoes shawls and tippets and called from the doorstep mind the carriage is to be back for me at ten then she returned to the drawingroom where archer on reentering it found her standing by the mantelpiece examining herself in the mirror it was not usual in new york society for a lady to address her parlourmaid as my dear one and send her out on an errand wrapped in her own operacloak and archer through all his deeper feelings tasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action followed on emotion with such olympian speed madame olenska did not move when he came up behind her and for a second their eyes met in the mirror then she turned threw herself into her sofacorner and sighed out theres time for a cigarette he handed her the box and lit a spill for her and as the flame flashed up into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said what do you think of me in a temper archer paused a moment then he answered with sudden resolution it makes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you i knew shed been talking about me well she said you were used to all kinds of thingssplendours and amusements and excitementsthat we could never hope to give you here madame olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips medora is incorrigibly romantic it has made up to her for so many things archer hesitated again and again took his risk is your aunts romanticism always consistent with accuracy you mean does she speak the truth her niece considered well ill tell you in almost everything she says theres something true and something untrue but why do you ask what has she been telling you he looked away into the fire and then back at her shining presence his heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening by that fireside and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry her away she saysshe pretends that count olenski has asked her to persuade you to go back to him madame olenska made no answer she sat motionless holding her cigarette in her halflifted hand the expression of her face had not changed and archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent incapacity for surprise you knew then he broke out she was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette she brushed it to the floor she has hinted about a letter poor darling medoras hints is it at your husbands request that she has arrived here suddenly madame olenska seemed to consider this question also there again one cant tell she told me she had had a spiritual summons whatever that is from dr carver im afraid shes going to marry dr carver poor medora theres always some one she wants to marry but perhaps the people in cuba just got tired of her i think she was with them as a sort of paid companion really i dont know why she came but you do believe she has a letter from your husband again madame olenska brooded silently then she said after all it was to be expected the young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace a sudden restlessness possessed him and he was tonguetied by the sense that their minutes were numbered and that at any moment he might hear the wheels of the returning carriage you know that your aunt believes you will go back madame olenska raised her head quickly a deep blush rose to her face and spread over her neck and shoulders she blushed seldom and painfully as if it hurt her like a burn many cruel things have been believed of me she said oh ellenforgive me im a fool and a brute she smiled a little you are horribly nervous you have your own troubles i know you think the wellands are unreasonable about your marriage and of course i agree with you in europe people dont understand our long american engagements i suppose they are not as calm as we are she pronounced the we with a faint emphasis that gave it an ironic sound archer felt the irony but did not dare to take it up after all she had perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs and after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that all he could do was to follow her lead but the sense of the waning hour made him desperate he could not bear the thought that a barrier of words should drop between them again yes he said abruptly i went south to ask may to marry me after easter theres no reason why we shouldnt be married then and may adores youand yet you couldnt convince her i thought her too intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions she is too intelligentshes not their slave madame olenska looked at him well theni dont understand archer reddened and hurried on with a rush we had a frank talkalmost the first she thinks my impatience a bad sign merciful heavensa bad sign she thinks it means that i cant trust myself to go on caring for her she thinks in short i want to marry her at once to get away from some one that icare for more madame olenska examined this curiously but if she thinks thatwhy isnt she in a hurry too because shes not like that shes so much nobler she insists all the more on the long engagement to give me time time to give her up for the other woman if i want to madame olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed eyes down the quiet street archer heard the approaching trot of her horses that is noble she said with a slight break in her voice yes but its ridiculous ridiculous because you dont care for any one else because i dont mean to marry any one else ah there was another long interval at length she looked up at him and asked this other womandoes she love you oh theres no other woman i mean the person that may was thinking of iswas never then why after all are you in such haste theres your carriage said archer she halfrose and looked about her with absent eyes her fan and gloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically yes i suppose i must be going youre going to mrs strutherss yes she smiled and added i must go where i am invited or i should be too lonely why not come with me archer felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him must make her give him the rest of her evening ignoring her question he continued to lean against the chimneypiece his eyes fixed on the hand in which she held her gloves and fan as if watching to see if he had the power to make her drop them may guessed the truth he said there is another womanbut not the one she thinks ellen olenska made no answer and did not move after a moment he sat down beside her and taking her hand softly unclasped it so that the gloves and fan fell on the sofa between them she started up and freeing herself from him moved away to the other side of the hearth ah dont make love to me too many people have done that she said frowning archer changing colour stood up also it was the bitterest rebuke she could have given him i have never made love to you he said and i never shall but you are the woman i would have married if it had been possible for either of us possible for either of us she looked at him with unfeigned astonishment and you say thatwhen its you whove made it impossible he stared at her groping in a blackness through which a single arrow of light tore its blinding way ive made it impossible you you you she cried her lip trembling like a childs on the verge of tears isnt it you who made me give up divorcinggive it up because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was how one must sacrifice ones self to preserve the dignity of marriage and to spare ones family the publicity the scandal and because my family was going to be your familyfor mays sake and for yoursi did what you told me what you proved to me that i ought to do ah she broke out with a sudden laugh ive made no secret of having done it for you she sank down on the sofa again crouching among the festive ripples of her dress like a stricken masquerader and the young man stood by the fireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving good god he groaned when i thought you thought ah dont ask me what i thought still looking at her he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck to her face she sat upright facing him with a rigid dignity i do ask you well then there were things in that letter you asked me to read my husbands letter yes i had nothing to fear from that letter absolutely nothing all i feared was to bring notoriety scandal on the familyon you and may good god he groaned again bowing his face in his hands the silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final and irrevocable it seemed to archer to be crushing him down like his own gravestone in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever lift that load from his heart he did not move from his place or raise his head from his hands his hidden eyeballs went on staring into utter darkness at least i loved you he brought out on the other side of the hearth from the sofacorner where he supposed that she still crouched he heard a faint stifled crying like a childs he started up and came to her side ellen what madness why are you crying nothings done that cant be undone im still free and youre going to be he had her in his arms her face like a wet flower at his lips and all their vain terrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise the one thing that astonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes arguing with her across the width of the room when just touching her made everything so simple she gave him back all his kiss but after a moment he felt her stiffening in his arms and she put him aside and stood up ah my poor newlandi suppose this had to be but it doesnt in the least alter things she said looking down at him in her turn from the hearth it alters the whole of life for me no noit mustnt it cant youre engaged to may welland and im married he stood up too flushed and resolute nonsense its too late for that sort of thing weve no right to lie to other people or to ourselves we wont talk of your marriage but do you see me marrying may after this she stood silent resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece her profile reflected in the glass behind her one of the locks of her chignon had become loosened and hung on her neck she looked haggard and almost old i dont see you she said at length putting that question to may do you he gave a reckless shrug its too late to do anything else you say that because its the easiest thing to say at this momentnot because its true in reality its too late to do anything but what wed both decided on ah i dont understand you she forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing it you dont understand because you havent yet guessed how youve changed things for me oh from the firstlong before i knew all youd done all id done yes i was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy of methat they thought i was a dreadful sort of person it seems they had even refused to meet me at dinner i found that out afterward and how youd made your mother go with you to the van der luydens and how youd insisted on announcing your engagement at the beaufort ball so that i might have two families to stand by me instead of one at that he broke into a laugh just imagine she said how stupid and unobservant i was i knew nothing of all this till granny blurted it out one day new york simply meant peace and freedom to me it was coming home and i was so happy at being among my own people that every one i met seemed kind and good and glad to see me but from the very beginning she continued i felt there was no one as kind as you no one who gave me reasons that i understood for doing what at first seemed so hard andunnecessary the very good people didnt convince me i felt theyd never been tempted but you knew you understood you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden handsand yet you hated the things it asks of one you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference that was what id never known beforeand its better than anything ive known she spoke in a low even voice without tears or visible agitation and each word as it dropped from her fell into his breast like burning lead he sat bowed over his head between his hands staring at the hearthrug and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her dress suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe she bent over him laying her hands on his shoulders and looking at him with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze ah dont let us undo what youve done she cried i cant go back now to that other way of thinking i cant love you unless i give you up his arms were yearning up to her but she drew away and they remained facing each other divided by the distance that her words had created then abruptly his anger overflowed and beaufort is he to replace me as the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of anger and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own but madame olenska only grew a shade paler and stood with her arms hanging down before her and her head slightly bent as her way was when she pondered a question hes waiting for you now at mrs strutherss why dont you go to him archer sneered she turned to ring the bell i shall not go out this evening tell the carriage to go and fetch the signora marchesa she said when the maid came after the door had closed again archer continued to look at her with bitter eyes why this sacrifice since you tell me that youre lonely ive no right to keep you from your friends she smiled a little under her wet lashes i shant be lonely now i was lonely i was afraid but the emptiness and the darkness are gone when i turn back into myself now im like a child going at night into a room where theres always a light her tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility and archer groaned out again i dont understand you yet you understand may he reddened under the retort but kept his eyes on her may is ready to give me up what three days after youve entreated her on your knees to hasten your marriage shes refused that gives me the right ah youve taught me what an ugly word that is she said he turned away with a sense of utter weariness he felt as though he had been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice and now just as he had fought his way to the top his hold had given way and he was pitching down headlong into darkness if he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her arguments but she still held him at a distance by something inscrutably aloof in her look and attitude and by his own awed sense of her sincerity at length he began to plead again if we do this now it will be worse afterwardworse for every one nonono she almost screamed as if he frightened her at that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house they had heard no carriage stopping at the door and they stood motionless looking at each other with startled eyes outside nastasias step crossed the hall the outer door opened and a moment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the countess olenska the lady was very happy at the flowers nastasia said smoothing her apron she thought it was her signor marito who had sent them and she cried a little and said it was a folly her mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope she tore it open and carried it to the lamp then when the door had closed again she handed the telegram to archer it was dated from st augustine and addressed to the countess olenska in it he read grannys telegram successful papa and mamma agree marriage after easter am telegraphing newland am too happy for words and love you dearly your grateful may half an hour later when archer unlocked his own frontdoor he found a similar envelope on the halltable on top of his pile of notes and letters the message inside the envelope was also from may welland and ran as follows parents consent wedding tuesday after easter at twelve grace church eight bridesmaids please see rector so happy love may archer crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate the news it contained then he pulled out a small pocketdiary and turned over the pages with trembling fingers but he did not find what he wanted and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the stairs a light was shining through the door of the little hallroom which served janey as a dressingroom and boudoir and her brother rapped impatiently on the panel the door opened and his sister stood before him in her immemorial purple flannel dressinggown with her hair on pins her face looked pale and apprehensive newland i hope theres no bad news in that telegram i waited on purpose in case no item of his correspondence was safe from janey he took no notice of her question look herewhat day is easter this year she looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance easter newland why of course the first week in april why the first week he turned again to the pages of his diary calculating rapidly under his breath the first week did you say he threw back his head with a long laugh for mercys sake whats the matter nothings the matter except that im going to be married in a month janey fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast oh newland how wonderful im so glad but dearest why do you keep on laughing do hush or youll wake mamma book ii the day was fresh with a lively spring wind full of dust all the old ladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing ermines and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered the faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar newland archer at a signal from the sexton had come out of the vestry and placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of grace church the signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was in sight but there was sure to be a considerable interval of adjustment and consultation in the lobby where the bridesmaids were already hovering like a cluster of easter blossoms during this unavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom in proof of his eagerness was expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled company and archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as through all the others which made of a nineteenth century new york wedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history everything was equally easyor equally painful as one chose to put itin the path he was committed to tread and he had obeyed the flurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms had obeyed his own in the days when he had guided them through the same labyrinth so far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations the bridesmaids eight bouquets of white lilac and liliesofthevalley had been sent in due time as well as the gold and sapphire sleevelinks of the eight ushers and the best mans catseye scarfpin archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording of his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and exladyloves the fees for the bishop and the rector were safely in the pocket of his best man his own luggage was already at mrs manson mingotts where the weddingbreakfast was to take place and so were the travelling clothes into which he was to change and a private compartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young couple to their unknown destinationconcealment of the spot in which the bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of the prehistoric ritual got the ring all right whispered young van der luyden newland who was inexperienced in the duties of a best man and awed by the weight of his responsibility archer made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make with his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey waistcoat and assured himself that the little gold circlet engraved inside newland to may april 187 was in its place then resuming his former attitude his tall hat and pearlgrey gloves with black stitchings grasped in his left hand he stood looking at the door of the church overhead handels march swelled pompously through the imitation stone vaulting carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at which with cheerful indifference he had stood on the same chancel step watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms how like a first night at the opera he thought recognising all the same faces in the same boxes no pews and wondering if when the last trump sounded mrs selfridge merry would be there with the same towering ostrich feathers in her bonnet and mrs beaufort with the same diamond earrings and the same smileand whether suitable proscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world after that there was still time to review one by one the familiar countenances in the first rows the womens sharp with curiosity and excitement the mens sulky with the obligation of having to put on their frockcoats before luncheon and fight for food at the weddingbreakfast too bad the breakfast is at old catherines the bridegroom could fancy reggie chivers saying but im told that lovell mingott insisted on its being cooked by his own chef so it ought to be good if one can only get at it and he could imagine sillerton jackson adding with authority my dear fellow havent you heard its to be served at small tables in the new english fashion archers eyes lingered a moment on the lefthand pew where his mother who had entered the church on mr henry van der luydens arm sat weeping softly under her chantilly veil her hands in her grandmothers ermine muff poor janey he thought looking at his sister even by screwing her head around she can see only the people in the few front pews and theyre mostly dowdy newlands and dagonets on the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved for the families he saw beaufort tall and redfaced scrutinising the women with his arrogant stare beside him sat his wife all silvery chinchilla and violets and on the far side of the ribbon lawrence leffertss sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the invisible deity of good form who presided at the ceremony archer wondered how many flaws leffertss keen eyes would discover in the ritual of his divinity then he suddenly recalled that he too had once thought such questions important the things that had filled his days seemed now like a nursery parody of life or like the wrangles of mediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever understood a stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be shown had darkened the last hours before the wedding and it seemed inconceivable to archer that grownup people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles and that the matter should have been decided in the negative by mrs wellands saying with indignant tears i should as soon turn the reporters loose in my house yet there was a time when archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with worldwide significance and all the while i suppose he thought real people were living somewhere and real things happening to them there they come breathed the best man excitedly but the bridegroom knew better the cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that mr brown the liverystable keeper gowned in black in his intermittent character of sexton was taking a preliminary survey of the scene before marshalling his forces the door was softly shut again then after another interval it swung majestically open and a murmur ran through the church the family mrs welland came first on the arm of her eldest son her large pink face was appropriately solemn and her plumcoloured satin with pale blue sidepanels and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet met with general approval but before she had settled herself with a stately rustle in the pew opposite mrs archers the spectators were craning their necks to see who was coming after her wild rumours had been abroad the day before to the effect that mrs manson mingott in spite of her physical disabilities had resolved on being present at the ceremony and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting character that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk up the nave and squeeze into a seat it was known that she had insisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of taking down the end panel of the front pew and to measure the space between the seat and the front but the result had been discouraging and for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the plan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel the idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the curbstone the idea of doing away with this awning and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas exceeded even old catherines courage though for a moment she had weighed the possibility why they might take a photograph of my child and put it in the papers mrs welland exclaimed when her mothers last plan was hinted to her and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder the ancestress had had to give in but her concession was bought only by the promise that the weddingbreakfast should take place under her roof though as the washington square connection said with the wellands house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere though all these transactions had been widely reported by the jacksons a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old catherine would appear in church and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature when she was found to have been replaced by her daughterinlaw mrs lovell mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies of her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress but once the disappointment occasioned by her motherinlaws nonappearance had subsided it was agreed that her black chantilly over lilac satin with a bonnet of parma violets formed the happiest contrast to mrs wellands blue and plumcolour far different was the impression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on mr mingotts arm in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and floating scarves and as this last apparition glided into view archers heart contracted and stopped beating he had taken it for granted that the marchioness manson was still in washington where she had gone some four weeks previously with her niece madame olenska it was generally understood that their abrupt departure was due to madame olenskas desire to remove her aunt from the baleful eloquence of dr agathon carver who had nearly succeeded in enlisting her as a recruit for the valley of love and in the circumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for the wedding for a moment archer stood with his eyes fixed on medoras fantastic figure straining to see who came behind her but the little procession was at an end for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats and the eight tall ushers gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby newlandi say shes here the best man whispered archer roused himself with a start a long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating for the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave the bishop the rector and two whitewinged assistants were hovering about the flowerbanked altar and the first chords of the spohr symphony were strewing their flowerlike notes before the bride archer opened his eyes but could they really have been shut as he imagined and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task the music the scent of the lilies on the altar the vision of the cloud of tulle and orangeblossoms floating nearer and nearer the sight of mrs archers face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs the low benedictory murmur of the rectors voice the ordered evolutions of the eight pink bridesmaids and the eight black ushers all these sights sounds and sensations so familiar in themselves so unutterably strange and meaningless in his new relation to them were confusedly mingled in his brain my god he thought have i got the ringand once more he went through the bridegrooms convulsive gesture then in a moment may was beside him such radiance streaming from her that it sent a faint warmth through his numbness and he straightened himself and smiled into her eyes dearly beloved we are gathered together here the rector began the ring was on her hand the bishops benediction had been given the bridesmaids were apoise to resume their place in the procession and the organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the mendelssohn march without which no newlywedded couple had ever emerged upon new york your armi say give her your arm young newland nervously hissed and once more archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the unknown what was it that had sent him there he wondered perhaps the glimpse among the anonymous spectators in the transept of a dark coil of hair under a hat which a moment later revealed itself as belonging to an unknown lady with a long nose so laughably unlike the person whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were becoming subject to hallucinations and now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave carried forward on the light mendelssohn ripples the spring day beckoning to them through widely opened doors and mrs wellands chestnuts with big white favours on their frontlets curvetting and showing off at the far end of the canvas tunnel the footman who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel wrapped mays white cloak about her and archer jumped into the brougham at her side she turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands clasped under her veil darling archer saidand suddenly the same black abyss yawned before him and he felt himself sinking into it deeper and deeper while his voice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully yes of course i thought id lost the ring no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a bridegroom didnt go through that but you did keep me waiting you know i had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen she surprised him by turning in full fifth avenue and flinging her arms about his neck but none ever can happen now can it newland as long as we two are together every detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the young couple after the weddingbreakfast had ample time to put on their travellingclothes descend the wide mingott stairs between laughing bridesmaids and weeping parents and get into the brougham under the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers and there was still half an hour left in which to drive to the station buy the last weeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers and settle themselves in the reserved compartment in which mays maid had already placed her dovecoloured travelling cloak and glaringly new dressingbag from london the old du lac aunts at rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal of the bridal couple with a readiness inspired by the prospect of spending a week in new york with mrs archer and archer glad to escape the usual bridal suite in a philadelphia or baltimore hotel had accepted with an equal alacrity may was enchanted at the idea of going to the country and childishly amused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where their mysterious retreat was situated it was thought very english to have a countryhouse lent to one and the fact gave a last touch of distinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant wedding of the year but where the house was no one was permitted to know except the parents of bride and groom who when taxed with the knowledge pursed their lips and said mysteriously ah they didnt tell us which was manifestly true since there was no need to once they were settled in their compartment and the train shaking off the endless wooden suburbs had pushed out into the pale landscape of spring talk became easier than archer had expected may was still in look and tone the simple girl of yesterday eager to compare notes with him as to the incidents of the wedding and discussing them as impartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher at first archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an inward tremor but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil unawareness she was alone for the first time with her husband but her husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday there was no one whom she liked as much no one whom she trusted as completely and the culminating lark of the whole delightful adventure of engagement and marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey like a grownup person like a married woman in fact it was wonderful thatas he had learned in the mission garden at st augustinesuch depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of imagination but he remembered how even then she had surprised him by dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience had been eased of its burden and he saw that she would probably go through life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as it came but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance perhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their transparency and her face the look of representing a type rather than a person as if she might have been chosen to pose for a civic virtue or a greek goddess the blood that ran so close to her fair skin might have been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element yet her look of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor dull but only primitive and pure in the thick of this meditation archer suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a stranger and plunged into a reminiscence of the weddingbreakfast and of granny mingotts immense and triumphant pervasion of it may settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject i was surprised thoughwerent youthat aunt medora came after all ellen wrote that they were neither of them well enough to take the journey i do wish it had been she who had recovered did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me he had known that the moment must come sooner or later but he had somewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay yesino yes it was beautiful he said looking at her blindly and wondering if whenever he heard those two syllables all his carefully builtup world would tumble about him like a house of cards arent you tired it will be good to have some tea when we arriveim sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready he rattled on taking her hand in his and her mind rushed away instantly to the magnificent tea and coffee service of baltimore silver which the beauforts had sent and which went so perfectly with uncle lovell mingotts trays and sidedishes in the spring twilight the train stopped at the rhinebeck station and they walked along the platform to the waiting carriage ah how awfully kind of the van der luydenstheyve sent their man over from skuytercliff to meet us archer exclaimed as a sedate person out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags im extremely sorry sir said this emissary that a little accident has occurred at the miss du lacs a leak in the watertank it happened yesterday and mr van der luyden who heard of it this morning sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the patroons house ready it will be quite comfortable i think youll find sir and the miss du lacs have sent their cook over so that it will be exactly the same as if youd been at rhinebeck archer stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more apologetic accents itll be exactly the same sir i do assure you and mays eager voice broke out covering the embarrassed silence the same as rhinebeck the patroons house but it will be a hundred thousand times betterwont it newland its too dear and kind of mr van der luyden to have thought of it and as they drove off with the maid beside the coachman and their shining bridal bags on the seat before them she went on excitedly only fancy ive never been inside ithave you the van der luydens show it to so few people but they opened it for ellen it seems and she told me what a darling little place it was she says its the only house shes seen in america that she could imagine being perfectly happy in wellthats what were going to be isnt it cried her husband gaily and she answered with her boyish smile ah its just our luck beginningthe wonderful luck were always going to have together of course we must dine with mrs carfry dearest archer said and his wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental britannia ware of their lodging house breakfasttable in all the rainy desert of autumnal london there were only two people whom the newland archers knew and these two they had sedulously avoided in conformity with the old new york tradition that it was not dignified to force ones self on the notice of ones acquaintances in foreign countries mrs archer and janey in the course of their visits to europe had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle and met the friendly advances of their fellowtravellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a foreigner other than those employed in hotels and railwaystations their own compatriotssave those previously known or properly accreditedthey treated with an even more pronounced disdain so that unless they ran across a chivers a dagonet or a mingott their months abroad were spent in an unbroken teteatete but the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing and one night at botzen one of the two english ladies in the room across the passage whose names dress and social situation were already intimately known to janey had knocked on the door and asked if mrs archer had a bottle of liniment the other ladythe intruders sister mrs carfryhad been seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis and mrs archer who never travelled without a complete family pharmacy was fortunately able to produce the required remedy mrs carfry was very ill and as she and her sister miss harle were travelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the archer ladies who supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid helped to nurse the invalid back to health when the archers left botzen they had no idea of ever seeing mrs carfry and miss harle again nothing to mrs archers mind would have been more undignified than to force ones self on the notice of a foreigner to whom one had happened to render an accidental service but mrs carfry and her sister to whom this point of view was unknown and who would have found it utterly incomprehensible felt themselves linked by an eternal gratitude to the delightful americans who had been so kind at botzen with touching fidelity they seized every chance of meeting mrs archer and janey in the course of their continental travels and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding out when they were to pass through london on their way to or from the states the intimacy became indissoluble and mrs archer and janey whenever they alighted at browns hotel found themselves awaited by two affectionate friends who like themselves cultivated ferns in wardian cases made macrame lace read the memoirs of the baroness bunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading london pulpits as mrs archer said it made another thing of london to know mrs carfry and miss harle and by the time that newland became engaged the tie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought only right to send a wedding invitation to the two english ladies who sent in return a pretty bouquet of pressed alpine flowers under glass and on the dock when newland and his wife sailed for england mrs archers last word had been you must take may to see mrs carfry newland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction but mrs carfry with her usual acuteness had run them down and sent them an invitation to dine and it was over this invitation that may archer was wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins its all very well for you newland you know them but i shall feel so shy among a lot of people ive never met and what shall i wear newland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her she looked handsomer and more dianalike than ever the moist english air seemed to have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight hardness of her virginal features or else it was simply the inner glow of happiness shining through like a light under ice wear dearest i thought a trunkful of things had come from paris last week yes of course i meant to say that i shant know which to wear she pouted a little ive never dined out in london and i dont want to be ridiculous he tried to enter into her perplexity but dont englishwomen dress just like everybody else in the evening newland how can you ask such funny questions when they go to the theatre in old balldresses and bare heads well perhaps they wear new balldresses at home but at any rate mrs carfry and miss harle wont theyll wear caps like my mothersand shawls very soft shawls yes but how will the other women be dressed not as well as you dear he rejoined wondering what had suddenly developed in her janeys morbid interest in clothes she pushed back her chair with a sigh thats dear of you newland but it doesnt help me much he had an inspiration why not wear your weddingdress that cant be wrong can it oh dearest if i only had it here but its gone to paris to be made over for next winter and worth hasnt sent it back oh well said archer getting up look herethe fogs lifting if we made a dash for the national gallery we might manage to catch a glimpse of the pictures the newland archers were on their way home after a three months weddingtour which may in writing to her girl friends vaguely summarised as blissful they had not gone to the italian lakes on reflection archer had not been able to picture his wife in that particular setting her own inclination after a month with the paris dressmakers was for mountaineering in july and swimming in august this plan they punctually fulfilled spending july at interlaken and grindelwald and august at a little place called etretat on the normandy coast which some one had recommended as quaint and quiet once or twice in the mountains archer had pointed southward and said theres italy and may her feet in a gentianbed had smiled cheerfully and replied it would be lovely to go there next winter if only you didnt have to be in new york but in reality travelling interested her even less than he had expected she regarded it once her clothes were ordered as merely an enlarged opportunity for walking riding swimming and trying her hand at the fascinating new game of lawn tennis and when they finally got back to london where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered his clothes she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she looked forward to sailing in london nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops and she found the theatres less exciting than the paris cafes chantants where under the blossoming horsechestnuts of the champs elysees she had had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant terrace on an audience of cocottes and having her husband interpret to her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears archer had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage it was less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat may exactly as all his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice the theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied there was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free and he had long since discovered that mays only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration her innate dignity would always keep her from making the gift abjectly and a day might even come as it once had when she would find strength to take it altogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good but with a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers such a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly outrageous in his own conduct and the fineness of her feeling for him made that unthinkable whatever happened he knew she would always be loyal gallant and unresentful and that pledged him to the practice of the same virtues all this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind if her simplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed and rebelled but since the lines of her character though so few were on the same fine mould as her face she became the tutelary divinity of all his old traditions and reverences such qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel though they made her so easy and pleasant a companion but he saw at once how they would fall into place in their proper setting he had no fear of being oppressed by them for his artistic and intellectual life would go on as it always had outside the domestic circle and within it there would be nothing small and stiflingcoming back to his wife would never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open and when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would be filled all these things went through his mind during their long slow drive from mayfair to south kensington where mrs carfry and her sister lived archer too would have preferred to escape their friends hospitality in conformity with the family tradition he had always travelled as a sightseer and lookeron affecting a haughty unconsciousness of the presence of his fellowbeings once only just after harvard he had spent a few gay weeks at florence with a band of queer europeanised americans dancing all night with titled ladies in palaces and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the fashionable club but it had all seemed to him though the greatest fun in the world as unreal as a carnival these queer cosmopolitan women deep in complicated loveaffairs which they appeared to feel the need of retailing to every one they met and the magnificent young officers and elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their confidences were too different from the people archer had grown up among too much like expensive and rather malodorous hothouse exotics to detain his imagination long to introduce his wife into such a society was out of the question and in the course of his travels no other had shown any marked eagerness for his company not long after their arrival in london he had run across the duke of st austrey and the duke instantly and cordially recognising him had said look me up wont youbut no properspirited american would have considered that a suggestion to be acted on and the meeting was without a sequel they had even managed to avoid mays english aunt the bankers wife who was still in yorkshire in fact they had purposely postponed going to london till the autumn in order that their arrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to these unknown relatives probably therell be nobody at mrs carfryslondons a desert at this season and youve made yourself much too beautiful archer said to may who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her skyblue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her to the london grime i dont want them to think that we dress like savages she replied with a scorn that pocahontas might have resented and he was struck again by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly american women for the social advantages of dress its their armour he thought their defence against the unknown and their defiance of it and he understood for the first time the earnestness with which may who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her hair to charm him had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and ordering her extensive wardrobe he had been right in expecting the party at mrs carfrys to be a small one besides their hostess and her sister they found in the long chilly drawingroom only another shawled lady a genial vicar who was her husband a silent lad whom mrs carfry named as her nephew and a small dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor pronouncing a french name as she did so into this dimlylit and dimfeatured group may archer floated like a swan with the sunset on her she seemed larger fairer more voluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her and he perceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an extreme and infantile shyness what on earth will they expect me to talk about her helpless eyes implored him at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was calling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms but beauty even when distrustful of itself awakens confidence in the manly heart and the vicar and the frenchnamed tutor were soon manifesting to may their desire to put her at her ease in spite of their best efforts however the dinner was a languishing affair archer noticed that his wifes way of showing herself at her ease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her references so that though her loveliness was an encouragement to admiration her conversation was a chill to repartee the vicar soon abandoned the struggle but the tutor who spoke the most fluent and accomplished english gallantly continued to pour it out to her until the ladies to the manifest relief of all concerned went up to the drawingroom the vicar after a glass of port was obliged to hurry away to a meeting and the shy nephew who appeared to be an invalid was packed off to bed but archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine and suddenly archer found himself talking as he had not done since his last symposium with ned winsett the carfry nephew it turned out had been threatened with consumption and had had to leave harrow for switzerland where he had spent two years in the milder air of lake leman being a bookish youth he had been entrusted to m riviere who had brought him back to england and was to remain with him till he went up to oxford the following spring and m riviere added with simplicity that he should then have to look out for another job it seemed impossible archer thought that he should be long without one so varied were his interests and so many his gifts he was a man of about thirty with a thin ugly face may would certainly have called him commonlooking to which the play of his ideas gave an intense expressiveness but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his animation his father who had died young had filled a small diplomatic post and it had been intended that the son should follow the same career but an insatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism then into authorship apparently unsuccessful and at lengthafter other experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listenerinto tutoring english youths in switzerland before that however he had lived much in paris frequented the goncourt grenier been advised by maupassant not to attempt to write even that seemed to archer a dazzling honour and had often talked with merimee in his mothers house he had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for and it was apparent that his literary ambitions had failed his situation in fact seemed materially speaking no more brilliant than ned winsetts but he had lived in a world in which as he said no one who loved ideas need hunger mentally as it was precisely of that love that poor winsett was starving to death archer looked with a sort of vicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so richly in his poverty you see monsieur its worth everything isnt it to keep ones intellectual liberty not to enslave ones powers of appreciation ones critical independence it was because of that that i abandoned journalism and took to so much duller work tutoring and private secretaryship there is a good deal of drudgery of course but one preserves ones moral freedom what we call in french ones quant a soi and when one hears good talk one can join in it without compromising any opinions but ones own or one can listen and answer it inwardly ah good conversationtheres nothing like it is there the air of ideas is the only air worth breathing and so i have never regretted giving up either diplomacy or journalismtwo different forms of the same selfabdication he fixed his vivid eyes on archer as he lit another cigarette voyezvous monsieur to be able to look life in the face thats worth living in a garret for isnt it but after all one must earn enough to pay for the garret and i confess that to grow old as a private tutoror a private anythingis almost as chilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at bucharest sometimes i feel i must make a plunge an immense plunge do you suppose for instance there would be any opening for me in americain new york archer looked at him with startled eyes new york for a young man who had frequented the goncourts and flaubert and who thought the life of ideas the only one worth living he continued to stare at m riviere perplexedly wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and advantages would be the surest hindrance to success new yorknew yorkbut must it be especially new york he stammered utterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could offer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only necessity a sudden flush rose under m rivieres sallow skin ii thought it your metropolis is not the intellectual life more active there he rejoined then as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of having asked a favour he went on hastily one throws out random suggestionsmore to ones self than to others in reality i see no immediate prospect and rising from his seat he added without a trace of constraint but mrs carfry will think that i ought to be taking you upstairs during the homeward drive archer pondered deeply on this episode his hour with m riviere had put new air into his lungs and his first impulse had been to invite him to dine the next day but he was beginning to understand why married men did not always immediately yield to their first impulses that young tutor is an interesting fellow we had some awfully good talk after dinner about books and things he threw out tentatively in the hansom may roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had read so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the key to them the little frenchman wasnt he dreadfully common she questioned coldly and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at having been invited out in london to meet a clergyman and a french tutor the disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment ordinarily defined as snobbishness but by old new yorks sense of what was due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands if mays parents had entertained the carfrys in fifth avenue they would have offered them something more substantial than a parson and a schoolmaster but archer was on edge and took her up commoncommon where he queried and she returned with unusual readiness why i should say anywhere but in his schoolroom those people are always awkward in society but then she added disarmingly i suppose i shouldnt have known if he was clever archer disliked her use of the word clever almost as much as her use of the word common but he was beginning to fear his tendency to dwell on the things he disliked in her after all her point of view had always been the same it was that of all the people he had grown up among and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible until a few months ago he had never known a nice woman who looked at life differently and if a man married it must necessarily be among the nice ahthen i wont ask him to dine he concluded with a laugh and may echoed bewildered goodnessask the carfrys tutor well not on the same day with the carfrys if you prefer i shouldnt but i did rather want another talk with him hes looking for a job in new york her surprise increased with her indifference he almost fancied that she suspected him of being tainted with foreignness a job in new york what sort of a job people dont have french tutors what does he want to do chiefly to enjoy good conversation i understand her husband retorted perversely and she broke into an appreciative laugh oh newland how funny isnt that french on the whole he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her refusing to take seriously his wish to invite m riviere another afterdinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of new york and the more archer considered it the less he was able to fit m riviere into any conceivable picture of new york as he knew it he perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many problems would be thus negatively solved for him but as he paid the hansom and followed his wifes long train into the house he took refuge in the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the most difficult in marriage after that i suppose we shall have pretty nearly finished rubbing off each others angles he reflected but the worst of it was that mays pressure was already bearing on the very angles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep the small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea the turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus and castiron vases painted in chocolate colour standing at intervals along the winding path that led to the sea looped their garlands of petunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel half way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house which was also chocolatecoloured but with the tin roof of the verandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning two large targets had been placed against a background of shrubbery on the other side of the lawn facing the targets was pitched a real tent with benches and gardenseats about it a number of ladies in summer dresses and gentlemen in grey frockcoats and tall hats stood on the lawn or sat upon the benches and every now and then a slender girl in starched muslin would step from the tent bow in hand and speed her shaft at one of the targets while the spectators interrupted their talk to watch the result newland archer standing on the verandah of the house looked curiously down upon this scene on each side of the shiny painted steps was a large blue china flowerpot on a bright yellow china stand a spiky green plant filled each pot and below the verandah ran a wide border of blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums behind him the french windows of the drawingrooms through which he had passed gave glimpses between swaying lace curtains of glassy parquet floors islanded with chintz poufs dwarf armchairs and velvet tables covered with trifles in silver the newport archery club always held its august meeting at the beauforts the sport which had hitherto known no rival but croquet was beginning to be discarded in favour of lawntennis but the latter game was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions and as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes the bow and arrow held their own archer looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle it surprised him that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions to it had so completely changed it was newport that had first brought home to him the extent of the change in new york during the previous winter after he and may had settled down in the new greenishyellow house with the bowwindow and the pompeian vestibule he had dropped back with relief into the old routine of the office and the renewal of this daily activity had served as a link with his former self then there had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey stepper for mays brougham the wellands had given the carriage and the abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library which in spite of family doubts and disapprovals had been carried out as he had dreamed with a dark embossed paper eastlake bookcases and sincere armchairs and tables at the century he had found winsett again and at the knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own set and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to dining out or entertaining friends at home with an occasional evening at the opera or the play the life he was living had still seemed a fairly real and inevitable sort of business but newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of unmitigated holidaymaking archer had tried to persuade may to spend the summer on a remote island off the coast of maine called appropriately enough mount desert where a few hardy bostonians and philadelphians were camping in native cottages and whence came reports of enchanting scenery and a wild almost trapperlike existence amid woods and waters but the wellands always went to newport where they owned one of the square boxes on the cliffs and their soninlaw could adduce no good reason why he and may should not join them there as mrs welland rather tartly pointed out it was hardly worth while for may to have worn herself out trying on summer clothes in paris if she was not to be allowed to wear them and this argument was of a kind to which archer had as yet found no answer may herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with so reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer she reminded him that he had always liked newport in his bachelor days and as this was indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to like it better than ever now that they were to be there together but as he stood on the beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly peopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to like it at all it was not mays fault poor dear if now and then during their travels they had fallen slightly out of step harmony had been restored by their return to the conditions she was used to he had always foreseen that she would not disappoint him and he had been right he had married as most young men did because he had met a perfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless sentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust and she had represented peace stability comradeship and the steadying sense of an unescapable duty he could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice for she had fulfilled all that he had expected it was undoubtedly gratifying to be the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married women in new york especially when she was also one of the sweetesttempered and most reasonable of wives and archer had never been insensible to such advantages as for the momentary madness which had fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage he had trained himself to regard it as the last of his discarded experiments the idea that he could ever in his senses have dreamed of marrying the countess olenska had become almost unthinkable and she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts but all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather empty and echoing place and he supposed that was one of the reasons why the busy animated people on the beaufort lawn shocked him as if they had been children playing in a graveyard he heard a murmur of skirts beside him and the marchioness manson fluttered out of the drawingroom window as usual she was extraordinarily festooned and bedizened with a limp leghorn hat anchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze and a little black velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over her much larger hatbrim my dear newland i had no idea that you and may had arrived you yourself came only yesterday you say ah businessbusinessprofessional duties i understand many husbands i know find it impossible to join their wives here except for the weekend she cocked her head on one side and languished at him through screwedup eyes but marriage is one long sacrifice as i used often to remind my ellen archers heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once before and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and the outer world but this break of continuity must have been of the briefest for he presently heard medora answering a question he had apparently found voice to put no i am not staying here but with the blenkers in their delicious solitude at portsmouth beaufort was kind enough to send his famous trotters for me this morning so that i might have at least a glimpse of one of reginas gardenparties but this evening i go back to rural life the blenkers dear original beings have hired a primitive old farmhouse at portsmouth where they gather about them representative people she drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim and added with a faint blush this week dr agathon carver is holding a series of inner thought meetings there a contrast indeed to this gay scene of worldly pleasurebut then i have always lived on contrasts to me the only death is monotony i always say to ellen beware of monotony its the mother of all the deadly sins but my poor child is going through a phase of exaltation of abhorrence of the world you know i suppose that she has declined all invitations to stay at newport even with her grandmother mingott i could hardly persuade her to come with me to the blenkers if you will believe it the life she leads is morbid unnatural ah if she had only listened to me when it was still possible when the door was still open but shall we go down and watch this absorbing match i hear your may is one of the competitors strolling toward them from the tent beaufort advanced over the lawn tall heavy too tightly buttoned into a london frockcoat with one of his own orchids in its buttonhole archer who had not seen him for two or three months was struck by the change in his appearance in the hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated and but for his erect squareshouldered walk he would have looked like an overfed and overdressed old man there were all sorts of rumours afloat about beaufort in the spring he had gone off on a long cruise to the west indies in his new steamyacht and it was reported that at various points where he had touched a lady resembling miss fanny ring had been seen in his company the steamyacht built in the clyde and fitted with tiled bathrooms and other unheardof luxuries was said to have cost him half a million and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his wife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are apt to be beauforts fortune was substantial enough to stand the strain and yet the disquieting rumours persisted not only in fifth avenue but in wall street some people said he had speculated unfortunately in railways others that he was being bled by one of the most insatiable members of her profession and to every report of threatened insolvency beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance the building of a new row of orchidhouses the purchase of a new string of racehorses or the addition of a new meissonnier or cabanel to his picturegallery he advanced toward the marchioness and newland with his usual halfsneering smile hullo medora did the trotters do their business forty minutes eh well thats not so bad considering your nerves had to be spared he shook hands with archer and then turning back with them placed himself on mrs mansons other side and said in a low voice a few words which their companion did not catch the marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks and a que voulezvous which deepened beauforts frown but he produced a good semblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at archer to say you know mays going to carry off the first prize ah then it remains in the family medora rippled and at that moment they reached the tent and mrs beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of mauve muslin and floating veils may welland was just coming out of the tent in her white dress with a pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat she had the same dianalike aloofness as when she had entered the beaufort ballroom on the night of her engagement in the interval not a thought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her heart and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both he marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from her she had her bow and arrow in her hand and placing herself on the chalkmark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and took aim the attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of appreciation followed her appearance and archer felt the glow of proprietorship that so often cheated him into momentary wellbeing her rivalsmrs reggie chivers the merry girls and divers rosy thorleys dagonets and mingotts stood behind her in a lovely anxious group brown heads and golden bent above the scores and pale muslins and flowerwreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow all were young and pretty and bathed in summer bloom but not one had the nymphlike ease of his wife when with tense muscles and happy frown she bent her soul upon some feat of strength gad archer heard lawrence lefferts say not one of the lot holds the bow as she does and beaufort retorted yes but thats the only kind of target shell ever hit archer felt irrationally angry his hosts contemptuous tribute to mays niceness was just what a husband should have wished to hear said of his wife the fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking in attraction was simply another proof of her quality yet the words sent a faint shiver through his heart what if niceness carried to that supreme degree were only a negation the curtain dropped before an emptiness as he looked at may returning flushed and calm from her final bullseye he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that curtain she took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the company with the simplicity that was her crowning grace no one could ever be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling that she would have been just as serene if she had missed them but when her eyes met her husbands her face glowed with the pleasure she saw in his mrs wellands basketwork ponycarriage was waiting for them and they drove off among the dispersing carriages may handling the reins and archer sitting at her side the afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and shrubberies and up and down bellevue avenue rolled a double line of victorias dogcarts landaus and visavis carrying welldressed ladies and gentlemen away from the beaufort gardenparty or homeward from their daily afternoon turn along the ocean drive shall we go to see granny may suddenly proposed i should like to tell her myself that ive won the prize theres lots of time before dinner archer acquiesced and she turned the ponies down narragansett avenue crossed spring street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond in this unfashionable region catherine the great always indifferent to precedent and thrifty of purse had built herself in her youth a manypeaked and crossbeamed cottageorne on a bit of cheap land overlooking the bay here in a thicket of stunted oaks her verandahs spread themselves above the islanddotted waters a winding drive led up between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of geraniums to a front door of highlyvarnished walnut under a striped verandahroof and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow starpatterned parquet floor upon which opened four small square rooms with heavy flockpapers under ceilings on which an italian housepainter had lavished all the divinities of olympus one of these rooms had been turned into a bedroom by mrs mingott when the burden of flesh descended on her and in the adjoining one she spent her days enthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window and perpetually waving a palmleaf fan which the prodigious projection of her bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set in motion stirred only the fringe of the antimacassars on the chairarms since she had been the means of hastening his marriage old catherine had shown to archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites toward the person served she was persuaded that irrepressible passion was the cause of his impatience and being an ardent admirer of impulsiveness when it did not lead to the spending of money she always received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of allusion to which may seemed fortunately impervious she examined and appraised with much interest the diamondtipped arrow which had been pinned on mays bosom at the conclusion of the match remarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought enough but that there was no denying that beaufort did things handsomely quite an heirloom in fact my dear the old lady chuckled you must leave it in fee to your eldest girl she pinched mays white arm and watched the colour flood her face well well what have i said to make you shake out the red flag aint there going to be any daughtersonly boys eh good gracious look at her blushing again all over her blushes whatcant i say that either mercy mewhen my children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out overhead i always say im too thankful to have somebody about me that nothing can shock archer burst into a laugh and may echoed it crimson to the eyes well now tell me all about the party please my dears for i shall never get a straight word about it out of that silly medora the ancestress continued and as may exclaimed cousin medora but i thought she was going back to portsmouth she answered placidly so she isbut shes got to come here first to pick up ellen ahyou didnt know ellen had come to spend the day with me such folderol her not coming for the summer but i gave up arguing with young people about fifty years ago ellenellen she cried in her shrill old voice trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn beyond the verandah there was no answer and mrs mingott rapped impatiently with her stick on the shiny floor a mulatto maidservant in a bright turban replying to the summons informed her mistress that she had seen miss ellen going down the path to the shore and mrs mingott turned to archer run down and fetch her like a good grandson this pretty lady will describe the party to me she said and archer stood up as if in a dream he had heard the countess olenskas name pronounced often enough during the year and a half since they had last met and was even familiar with the main incidents of her life in the interval he knew that she had spent the previous summer at newport where she appeared to have gone a great deal into society but that in the autumn she had suddenly sublet the perfect house which beaufort had been at such pains to find for her and decided to establish herself in washington there during the winter he had heard of her as one always heard of pretty women in washington as shining in the brilliant diplomatic society that was supposed to make up for the social shortcomings of the administration he had listened to these accounts and to various contradictory reports on her appearance her conversation her point of view and her choice of friends with the detachment with which one listens to reminiscences of some one long since dead not till medora suddenly spoke her name at the archery match had ellen olenska become a living presence to him again the marchionesss foolish lisp had called up a vision of the little firelit drawingroom and the sound of the carriagewheels returning down the deserted street he thought of a story he had read of some peasant children in tuscany lighting a bunch of straw in a wayside cavern and revealing old silent images in their painted tomb the way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was perched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows through their veil archer caught the glint of the lime rock with its whitewashed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic lighthouse keeper ida lewis was living her last venerable years beyond it lay the flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of goat island the bay spreading northward in a shimmer of gold to prudence island with its low growth of oaks and the shores of conanicut faint in the sunset haze from the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of pagodalike summerhouse and in the pagoda a lady stood leaning against the rail her back to the shore archer stopped at the sight as if he had waked from sleep that vision of the past was a dream and the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead was mrs wellands ponycarriage circling around and around the oval at the door was may sitting under the shameless olympians and glowing with secret hopes was the welland villa at the far end of bellevue avenue and mr welland already dressed for dinner and pacing the drawingroom floor watch in hand with dyspeptic impatiencefor it was one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is happening at a given hour what am i a soninlaw archer thought the figure at the end of the pier had not moved for a long moment the young man stood half way down the bank gazing at the bay furrowed with the coming and going of sailboats yachtlaunches fishingcraft and the trailing black coalbarges hauled by noisy tugs the lady in the summerhouse seemed to be held by the same sight beyond the grey bastions of fort adams a longdrawn sunset was splintering up into a thousand fires and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it beat out through the channel between the lime rock and the shore archer as he watched remembered the scene in the shaughraun and montague lifting ada dyass ribbon to his lips without her knowing that he was in the room she doesnt knowshe hasnt guessed shouldnt i know if she came up behind me i wonder he mused and suddenly he said to himself if she doesnt turn before that sail crosses the lime rock light ill go back the boat was gliding out on the receding tide it slid before the lime rock blotted out ida lewiss little house and passed across the turret in which the light was hung archer waited till a wide space of water sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the boat but still the figure in the summerhouse did not move he turned and walked up the hill im sorry you didnt find elleni should have liked to see her again may said as they drove home through the dusk but perhaps she wouldnt have caredshe seems so changed changed echoed her husband in a colourless voice his eyes fixed on the ponies twitching ears so indifferent to her friends i mean giving up new york and her house and spending her time with such queer people fancy how hideously uncomfortable she must be at the blenkers she says she does it to keep cousin medora out of mischief to prevent her marrying dreadful people but i sometimes think weve always bored her archer made no answer and she continued with a tinge of hardness that he had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice after all i wonder if she wouldnt be happier with her husband he burst into a laugh sancta simplicitas he exclaimed and as she turned a puzzled frown on him he added i dont think i ever heard you say a cruel thing before cruel wellwatching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a favourite sport of the angels but i believe even they dont think people happier in hell its a pity she ever married abroad then said may in the placid tone with which her mother met mr wellands vagaries and archer felt himself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands they drove down bellevue avenue and turned in between the chamfered wooden gateposts surmounted by castiron lamps which marked the approach to the welland villa lights were already shining through its windows and archer as the carriage stopped caught a glimpse of his fatherinlaw exactly as he had pictured him pacing the drawingroom watch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since found to be much more efficacious than anger the young man as he followed his wife into the hall was conscious of a curious reversal of mood there was something about the luxury of the welland house and the density of the welland atmosphere so charged with minute observances and exactions that always stole into his system like a narcotic the heavy carpets the watchful servants the perpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks the perpetually renewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table the whole chain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next and each member of the household to all the others made any less systematised and affluent existence seem unreal and precarious but now it was the welland house and the life he was expected to lead in it that had become unreal and irrelevant and the brief scene on the shore when he had stood irresolute halfway down the bank was as close to him as the blood in his veins all night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at mays side watching the moonlight slant along the carpet and thinking of ellen olenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind beauforts trotters a party for the blenkersthe blenkers mr welland laid down his knife and fork and looked anxiously and incredulously across the luncheontable at his wife who adjusting her gold eyeglasses read aloud in the tone of high comedy professor and mrs emerson sillerton request the pleasure of mr and mrs wellands company at the meeting of the wednesday afternoon club on august 25th at 3 oclock punctually to meet mrs and the misses blenker red gables catherine street r s v p good gracious mr welland gasped as if a second reading had been necessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him poor amy sillertonyou never can tell what her husband will do next mrs welland sighed i suppose hes just discovered the blenkers professor emerson sillerton was a thorn in the side of newport society and a thorn that could not be plucked out for it grew on a venerable and venerated family tree he was as people said a man who had had every advantage his father was sillerton jacksons uncle his mother a pennilow of boston on each side there was wealth and position and mutual suitability nothingas mrs welland had often remarkednothing on earth obliged emerson sillerton to be an archaeologist or indeed a professor of any sort or to live in newport in winter or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did but at least if he was going to break with tradition and flout society in the face he need not have married poor amy dagonet who had a right to expect something different and money enough to keep her own carriage no one in the mingott set could understand why amy sillerton had submitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the house with longhaired men and shorthaired women and when he travelled took her to explore tombs in yucatan instead of going to paris or italy but there they were set in their ways and apparently unaware that they were different from other people and when they gave one of their dreary annual gardenparties every family on the cliffs because of the sillertonpennilowdagonet connection had to draw lots and send an unwilling representative its a wonder mrs welland remarked that they didnt choose the cup race day do you remember two years ago their giving a party for a black man on the day of julia mingotts the dansant luckily this time theres nothing else going on that i know offor of course some of us will have to go mr welland sighed nervously some of us my dearmore than one three oclock is such a very awkward hour i have to be here at halfpast three to take my drops its really no use trying to follow bencombs new treatment if i dont do it systematically and if i join you later of course i shall miss my drive at the thought he laid down his knife and fork again and a flush of anxiety rose to his finelywrinkled cheek theres no reason why you should go at all my dear his wife answered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic i have some cards to leave at the other end of bellevue avenue and ill drop in at about halfpast three and stay long enough to make poor amy feel that she hasnt been slighted she glanced hesitatingly at her daughter and if newlands afternoon is provided for perhaps may can drive you out with the ponies and try their new russet harness it was a principle in the welland family that peoples days and hours should be what mrs welland called provided for the melancholy possibility of having to kill time especially for those who did not care for whist or solitaire was a vision that haunted her as the spectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist another of her principles was that parents should never at least visibly interfere with the plans of their married children and the difficulty of adjusting this respect for mays independence with the exigency of mr wellands claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity which left not a second of mrs wellands own time unprovided for of course ill drive with papaim sure newland will find something to do may said in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his lack of response it was a cause of constant distress to mrs welland that her soninlaw showed so little foresight in planning his days often already during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof when she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon he had answered paradoxically oh i think for a change ill just save it instead of spending it and once when she and may had had to go on a longpostponed round of afternoon calls he had confessed to having lain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house newland never seems to look ahead mrs welland once ventured to complain to her daughter and may answered serenely no but you see it doesnt matter because when theres nothing particular to do he reads a book ah yeslike his father mrs welland agreed as if allowing for an inherited oddity and after that the question of newlands unemployment was tacitly dropped nevertheless as the day for the sillerton reception approached may began to show a natural solicitude for his welfare and to suggest a tennis match at the chiverses or a sail on julius beauforts cutter as a means of atoning for her temporary desertion i shall be back by six you know dear papa never drives later than that and she was not reassured till archer said that he thought of hiring a runabout and driving up the island to a studfarm to look at a second horse for her brougham they had been looking for this horse for some time and the suggestion was so acceptable that may glanced at her mother as if to say you see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of us the idea of the studfarm and the brougham horse had germinated in archers mind on the very day when the emerson sillerton invitation had first been mentioned but he had kept it to himself as if there were something clandestine in the plan and discovery might prevent its execution he had however taken the precaution to engage in advance a runabout with a pair of old liverystable trotters that could still do their eighteen miles on level roads and at two oclock hastily deserting the luncheontable he sprang into the light carriage and drove off the day was perfect a breeze from the north drove little puffs of white cloud across an ultramarine sky with a bright sea running under it bellevue avenue was empty at that hour and after dropping the stablelad at the corner of mill street archer turned down the old beach road and drove across eastmans beach he had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which on halfholidays at school he used to start off into the unknown taking his pair at an easy gait he counted on reaching the studfarm which was not far beyond paradise rocks before three oclock so that after looking over the horse and trying him if he seemed promising he would still have four golden hours to dispose of as soon as he heard of the sillertons party he had said to himself that the marchioness manson would certainly come to newport with the blenkers and that madame olenska might again take the opportunity of spending the day with her grandmother at any rate the blenker habitation would probably be deserted and he would be able without indiscretion to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it he was not sure that he wanted to see the countess olenska again but ever since he had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted irrationally and indescribably to see the place she was living in and to follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the real one in the summerhouse the longing was with him day and night an incessant undefinable craving like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten he could not see beyond the craving or picture what it might lead to for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to madame olenska or to hear her voice he simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on and the way the sky and sea enclosed it the rest of the world might seem less empty when he reached the studfarm a glance showed him that the horse was not what he wanted nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to prove to himself that he was not in a hurry but at three oclock he shook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the byroads leading to portsmouth the wind had dropped and a faint haze on the horizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the saconnet on the turn of the tide but all about him fields and woods were steeped in golden light he drove past greyshingled farmhouses in orchards past hayfields and groves of oak past villages with white steeples rising sharply into the fading sky and at last after stopping to ask the way of some men at work in a field he turned down a lane between high banks of goldenrod and brambles at the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of the river to the left standing in front of a clump of oaks and maples he saw a long tumbledown house with white paint peeling from its clapboards on the roadside facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in which the new englander shelters his farming implements and visitors hitch their teams archer jumping down led his pair into the shed and after tying them to a post turned toward the house the patch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hayfield but to the left an overgrown boxgarden full of dahlias and rusty rosebushes encircled a ghostly summerhouse of trelliswork that had once been white surmounted by a wooden cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but continued to take ineffectual aim archer leaned for a while against the gate no one was in sight and not a sound came from the open windows of the house a grizzled newfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as the arrowless cupid it was strange to think that this place of silence and decay was the home of the turbulent blenkers yet archer was sure that he was not mistaken for a long time he stood there content to take in the scene and gradually falling under its drowsy spell but at length he roused himself to the sense of the passing time should he look his fill and then drive away he stood irresolute wishing suddenly to see the inside of the house so that he might picture the room that madame olenska sat in there was nothing to prevent his walking up to the door and ringing the bell if as he supposed she was away with the rest of the party he could easily give his name and ask permission to go into the sittingroom to write a message but instead he crossed the lawn and turned toward the boxgarden as he entered it he caught sight of something brightcoloured in the summerhouse and presently made it out to be a pink parasol the parasol drew him like a magnet he was sure it was hers he went into the summerhouse and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the silken thing and looked at its carved handle which was made of some rare wood that gave out an aromatic scent archer lifted the handle to his lips he heard a rustle of skirts against the box and sat motionless leaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands and letting the rustle come nearer without lifting his eyes he had always known that this must happen oh mr archer exclaimed a loud young voice and looking up he saw before him the youngest and largest of the blenker girls blonde and blowsy in bedraggled muslin a red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed to show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow and her halfawakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly graciouswhere did you drop from i must have been sound asleep in the hammock everybody else has gone to newport did you ring she incoherently enquired archers confusion was greater than hers inothat is i was just going to i had to come up the island to see about a horse and i drove over on a chance of finding mrs blenker and your visitors but the house seemed emptyso i sat down to wait miss blenker shaking off the fumes of sleep looked at him with increasing interest the house is empty mothers not here or the marchionessor anybody but me her glance became faintly reproachful didnt you know that professor and mrs sillerton are giving a gardenparty for mother and all of us this afternoon it was too unlucky that i couldnt go but ive had a sore throat and mother was afraid of the drive home this evening did you ever know anything so disappointing of course she added gaily i shouldnt have minded half as much if id known you were coming symptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her and archer found the strength to break in but madame olenskahas she gone to newport too miss blenker looked at him with surprise madame olenskadidnt you know shed been called away called away oh my best parasol i lent it to that goose of a katie because it matched her ribbons and the careless thing must have dropped it here we blenkers are all like that real bohemians recovering the sunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy dome above her head yes ellen was called away yesterday she lets us call her ellen you know a telegram came from boston she said she might be gone for two days i do love the way she does her hair dont you miss blenker rambled on archer continued to stare through her as though she had been transparent all he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its pinkness above her giggling head after a moment he ventured you dont happen to know why madame olenska went to boston i hope it was not on account of bad news miss blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity oh i dont believe so she didnt tell us what was in the telegram i think she didnt want the marchioness to know shes so romanticlooking isnt she doesnt she remind you of mrs scottsiddons when she reads lady geraldines courtship did you never hear her archer was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts his whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen he glanced about him at the unpruned garden the tumbledown house and the oakgrove under which the dusk was gathering it had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to have found madame olenska and she was far away and even the pink sunshade was not hers he frowned and hesitated you dont know i supposei shall be in boston tomorrow if i could manage to see her he felt that miss blenker was losing interest in him though her smile persisted oh of course how lovely of you shes staying at the parker house it must be horrible there in this weather after that archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they exchanged he could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that he should await the returning family and have high tea with them before he drove home at length with his hostess still at his side he passed out of range of the wooden cupid unfastened his horses and drove off at the turn of the lane he saw miss blenker standing at the gate and waving the pink parasol the next morning when archer got out of the fall river train he emerged upon a steaming midsummer boston the streets near the station were full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a shirtsleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of boarders going down the passage to the bathroom archer found a cab and drove to the somerset club for breakfast even the fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no excess of heat ever degrades the european cities caretakers in calico lounged on the doorsteps of the wealthy and the common looked like a pleasureground on the morrow of a masonic picnic if archer had tried to imagine ellen olenska in improbable scenes he could not have called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than this heatprostrated and deserted boston he breakfasted with appetite and method beginning with a slice of melon and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and scrambled eggs a new sense of energy and activity had possessed him ever since he had announced to may the night before that he had business in boston and should take the fall river boat that night and go on to new york the following evening it had always been understood that he would return to town early in the week and when he got back from his expedition to portsmouth a letter from the office which fate had conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table sufficed to justify his sudden change of plan he was even ashamed of the ease with which the whole thing had been done it reminded him for an uncomfortable moment of lawrence leffertss masterly contrivances for securing his freedom but this did not long trouble him for he was not in an analytic mood after breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the commercial advertiser while he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came in and the usual greetings were exchanged it was the same world after all though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the meshes of time and space he looked at his watch and finding that it was halfpast nine got up and went into the writingroom there he wrote a few lines and ordered a messenger to take a cab to the parker house and wait for the answer he then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to calculate how long it would take a cab to get to the parker house the lady was out sir he suddenly heard a waiters voice at his elbow and he stammered out as if it were a word in a strange language he got up and went into the hall it must be a mistake she could not be out at that hour he flushed with anger at his own stupidity why had he not sent the note as soon as he arrived he found his hat and stick and went forth into the street the city had suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a traveller from distant lands for a moment he stood on the doorstep hesitating then he decided to go to the parker house what if the messenger had been misinformed and she were still there he started to walk across the common and on the first bench under a tree he saw her sitting she had a grey silk sunshade over her headhow could he ever have imagined her with a pink one as he approached he was struck by her listless attitude she sat there as if she had nothing else to do he saw her drooping profile and the knot of hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat and the long wrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade he came a step or two nearer and she turned and looked at him ohshe said and for the first time he noticed a startled look on her face but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder and contentment ohshe murmured again on a different note as he stood looking down at her and without rising she made a place for him on the bench im here on businessjust got here archer explained and without knowing why he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her but what on earth are you doing in this wilderness he had really no idea what he was saying he felt as if he were shouting at her across endless distances and she might vanish again before he could overtake her i oh im here on business too she answered turning her head toward him so that they were face to face the words hardly reached him he was aware only of her voice and of the startling fact that not an echo of it had remained in his memory he had not even remembered that it was lowpitched with a faint roughness on the consonants you do your hair differently he said his heart beating as if he had uttered something irrevocable differently noits only that i do it as best i can when im without nastasia nastasia but isnt she with you no im alone for two days it was not worth while to bring her youre aloneat the parker house she looked at him with a flash of her old malice does it strike you as dangerous no not dangerous but unconventional i see i suppose it is she considered a moment i hadnt thought of it because ive just done something so much more unconventional the faint tinge of irony lingered in her eyes ive just refused to take back a sum of moneythat belonged to me archer sprang up and moved a step or two away she had furled her parasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel presently he came back and stood before her some onehas come here to meet you yes with this offer she nodded and you refusedbecause of the conditions i refused she said after a moment he sat down by her again what were the conditions oh they were not onerous just to sit at the head of his table now and then there was another interval of silence archers heart had slammed itself shut in the queer way it had and he sat vainly groping for a word he wants you backat any price wella considerable price at least the sum is considerable for me he paused again beating about the question he felt he must put it was to meet him here that you came she stared and then burst into a laugh meet himmy husband here at this season hes always at cowes or baden he sent some one yes with a letter she shook her head no just a message he never writes i dont think ive had more than one letter from him the allusion brought the colour to her cheek and it reflected itself in archers vivid blush why does he never write why should he what does one have secretaries for the young mans blush deepened she had pronounced the word as if it had no more significance than any other in her vocabulary for a moment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask did he send his secretary then but the remembrance of count olenskis only letter to his wife was too present to him he paused again and then took another plunge and the person the emissary the emissary madame olenska rejoined still smiling might for all i care have left already but he has insisted on waiting till this evening in case on the chance and you came out here to think the chance over i came out to get a breath of air the hotels too stifling im taking the afternoon train back to portsmouth they sat silent not looking at each other but straight ahead at the people passing along the path finally she turned her eyes again to his face and said youre not changed he felt like answering i was till i saw you again but instead he stood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park this is horrible why shouldnt we go out a little on the bay theres a breeze and it will be cooler we might take the steamboat down to point arley she glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went on on a monday morning there wont be anybody on the boat my train doesnt leave till evening im going back to new york why shouldnt we he insisted looking down at her and suddenly he broke out havent we done all we could ohshe murmured again she stood up and reopened her sunshade glancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene and assure herself of the impossibility of remaining in it then her eyes returned to his face you mustnt say things like that to me she said ill say anything you like or nothing i wont open my mouth unless you tell me to what harm can it do to anybody all i want is to listen to you he stammered she drew out a little goldfaced watch on an enamelled chain oh dont calculate he broke out give me the day i want to get you away from that man at what time was he coming her colour rose again at eleven then you must come at once you neednt be afraidif i dont come nor you eitherif you do i swear i only want to hear about you to know what youve been doing its a hundred years since weve metit may be another hundred before we meet again she still wavered her anxious eyes on his face why didnt you come down to the beach to fetch me the day i was at grannys she asked because you didnt look roundbecause you didnt know i was there i swore i wouldnt unless you looked round he laughed as the childishness of the confession struck him but i didnt look round on purpose on purpose i knew you were there when you drove in i recognised the ponies so i went down to the beach to get away from me as far as you could she repeated in a low voice to get away from you as far as i could he laughed out again this time in boyish satisfaction well you see its no use i may as well tell you he added that the business i came here for was just to find you but look here we must start or we shall miss our boat our boat she frowned perplexedly and then smiled oh but i must go back to the hotel first i must leave a note as many notes as you please you can write here he drew out a notecase and one of the new stylographic pens ive even got an envelopeyou see how everythings predestined theresteady the thing on your knee and ill get the pen going in a second they have to be humoured wait he banged the hand that held the pen against the back of the bench its like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer just a trick now try she laughed and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on his notecase began to write archer walked away a few steps staring with radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby who in their turn paused to stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionablydressed lady writing a note on her knee on a bench in the common madame olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope wrote a name on it and put it into her pocket then she too stood up they walked back toward beacon street and near the club archer caught sight of the plushlined herdic which had carried his note to the parker house and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing his brow at the corner hydrant i told you everything was predestined heres a cab for us you see they laughed astonished at the miracle of picking up a public conveyance at that hour and in that unlikely spot in a city where cabstands were still a foreign novelty archer looking at his watch saw that there was time to drive to the parker house before going to the steamboat landing they rattled through the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel archer held out his hand for the letter shall i take it in he asked but madame olenska shaking her head sprang out and disappeared through the glazed doors it was barely halfpast ten but what if the emissary impatient for her reply and not knowing how else to employ his time were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks at their elbows of whom archer had caught a glimpse as she went in he waited pacing up and down before the herdic a sicilian youth with eyes like nastasias offered to shine his boots and an irish matron to sell him peaches and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot men with straw hats tilted far back who glanced at him as they went by he marvelled that the door should open so often and that all the people it let out should look so like each other and so like all the other hot men who at that hour through the length and breadth of the land were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of hotels and then suddenly came a face that he could not relate to the other faces he caught but a flash of it for his pacings had carried him to the farthest point of his beat and it was in turning back to the hotel that he saw in a group of typical countenancesthe lank and weary the round and surprised the lanternjawed and mildthis other face that was so many more things at once and things so different it was that of a young man pale too and halfextinguished by the heat or worry or both but somehow quicker vivider more conscious or perhaps seeming so because he was so different archer hung a moment on a thin thread of memory but it snapped and floated off with the disappearing faceapparently that of some foreign business man looking doubly foreign in such a setting he vanished in the stream of passersby and archer resumed his patrol he did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel and his unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that if madame olenska was so long in reappearing it could only be because she had met the emissary and been waylaid by him at the thought archers apprehension rose to anguish if she doesnt come soon ill go in and find her he said the doors swung open again and she was at his side they got into the herdic and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had been absent just three minutes in the clatter of loose windows that made talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to the wharf seated side by side on a bench of the halfempty boat they found that they had hardly anything to say to each other or rather that what they had to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their release and their isolation as the paddlewheels began to turn and wharves and shipping to recede through the veil of heat it seemed to archer that everything in the old familiar world of habit was receding also he longed to ask madame olenska if she did not have the same feeling the feeling that they were starting on some long voyage from which they might never return but he was afraid to say it or anything else that might disturb the delicate balance of her trust in him in reality he had no wish to betray that trust there had been days and nights when the memory of their kiss had burned and burned on his lips the day before even on the drive to portsmouth the thought of her had run through him like fire but now that she was beside him and they were drifting forth into this unknown world they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper nearness that a touch may sunder as the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about them and the bay broke up into long oily undulations then into ripples tipped with spray the fog of sultriness still hung over the city but ahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters and distant promontories with lighthouses in the sun madame olenska leaning back against the boatrail drank in the coolness between parted lips she had wound a long veil about her hat but it left her face uncovered and archer was struck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression she seemed to take their adventure as a matter of course and to be neither in fear of unexpected encounters nor what was worse unduly elated by their possibility in the bare diningroom of the inn which he had hoped they would have to themselves they found a strident party of innocentlooking young men and womenschoolteachers on a holiday the landlord told themand archers heart sank at the idea of having to talk through their noise this is hopelessill ask for a private room he said and madame olenska without offering any objection waited while he went in search of it the room opened on a long wooden verandah with the sea coming in at the windows it was bare and cool with a table covered with a coarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a blueberry pie under a cage no more guilelesslooking cabinet particulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple archer fancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile with which madame olenska sat down opposite to him a woman who had run away from her husbandand reputedly with another manwas likely to have mastered the art of taking things for granted but something in the quality of her composure took the edge from his irony by being so quiet so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the conventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural thing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other they lunched slowly and meditatively with mute intervals between rushes of talk for the spell once broken they had much to say and yet moments when saying became the mere accompaniment to long duologues of silence archer kept the talk from his own affairs not with conscious intention but because he did not want to miss a word of her history and leaning on the table her chin resting on her clasped hands she talked to him of the year and a half since they had met she had grown tired of what people called society new york was kind it was almost oppressively hospitable she should never forget the way in which it had welcomed her back but after the first flush of novelty she had found herself as she phrased it too different to care for the things it cared aboutand so she had decided to try washington where one was supposed to meet more varieties of people and of opinion and on the whole she should probably settle down in washington and make a home there for poor medora who had worn out the patience of all her other relations just at the time when she most needed looking after and protecting from matrimonial perils but dr carverarent you afraid of dr carver i hear hes been staying with you at the blenkers she smiled oh the carver danger is over dr carver is a very clever man he wants a rich wife to finance his plans and medora is simply a good advertisement as a convert a convert to what to all sorts of new and crazy social schemes but do you know they interest me more than the blind conformity to traditionsomebody elses traditionthat i see among our own friends it seems stupid to have discovered america only to make it into a copy of another country she smiled across the table do you suppose christopher columbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the opera with the selfridge merrys archer changed colour and beaufortdo you say these things to beaufort he asked abruptly i havent seen him for a long time but i used to and he understands ah its what ive always told you you dont like us and you like beaufort because hes so unlike us he looked about the bare room and out at the bare beach and the row of stark white village houses strung along the shore were damnably dull weve no character no colour no varietyi wonder he broke out why you dont go back her eyes darkened and he expected an indignant rejoinder but she sat silent as if thinking over what he had said and he grew frightened lest she should answer that she wondered too at length she said i believe its because of you it was impossible to make the confession more dispassionately or in a tone less encouraging to the vanity of the person addressed archer reddened to the temples but dared not move or speak it was as if her words had been some rare butterfly that the least motion might drive off on startled wings but that might gather a flock about it if it were left undisturbed at least she continued it was you who made me understand that under the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate that even those i most cared for in my other life look cheap in comparison i dont know how to explain myselfshe drew together her troubled browsbut it seems as if id never before understood with how much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures may be paid exquisite pleasuresits something to have had them he felt like retorting but the appeal in her eyes kept him silent i want she went on to be perfectly honest with youand with myself for a long time ive hoped this chance would come that i might tell you how youve helped me what youve made of me archer sat staring beneath frowning brows he interrupted her with a laugh and what do you make out that youve made of me she paled a little of you yes for im of your making much more than you ever were of mine im the man who married one woman because another one told him to her paleness turned to a fugitive flush i thoughtyou promisedyou were not to say such things today ahhow like a woman none of you will ever see a bad business through she lowered her voice is it a bad businessfor may he stood in the window drumming against the raised sash and feeling in every fibre the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her cousins name for thats the thing weve always got to think ofhavent weby your own showing she insisted my own showing he echoed his blank eyes still on the sea or if not she continued pursuing her own thought with a painful application if its not worth while to have given up to have missed things so that others may be saved from disillusionment and miserythen everything i came home for everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of themall these things are a sham or a dream he turned around without moving from his place and in that case theres no reason on earth why you shouldnt go back he concluded for her her eyes were clinging to him desperately oh is there no reason not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage my marriage he said savagely isnt going to be a sight to keep you here she made no answer and he went on whats the use you gave me my first glimpse of a real life and at the same moment you asked me to go on with a sham one its beyond human enduringthats all oh dont say that when im enduring it she burst out her eyes filling her arms had dropped along the table and she sat with her face abandoned to his gaze as if in the recklessness of a desperate peril the face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person with the soul behind it archer stood dumb overwhelmed by what it suddenly told him you toooh all this time you too for answer she let the tears on her lids overflow and run slowly downward half the width of the room was still between them and neither made any show of moving archer was conscious of a curious indifference to her bodily presence he would hardly have been aware of it if one of the hands she had flung out on the table had not drawn his gaze as on the occasion when in the little twentythird street house he had kept his eye on it in order not to look at her face now his imagination spun about the hand as about the edge of a vortex but still he made no effort to draw nearer he had known the love that is fed on caresses and feeds them but this passion that was closer than his bones was not to be superficially satisfied his one terror was to do anything which might efface the sound and impression of her words his one thought that he should never again feel quite alone but after a moment the sense of waste and ruin overcame him there they were close together and safe and shut in yet so chained to their separate destinies that they might as well have been half the world apart whats the usewhen you will go back he broke out a great hopeless how on earth can i keep you crying out to her beneath his words she sat motionless with lowered lids ohi shant go yet not yet some time then some time that you already foresee at that she raised her clearest eyes i promise you not as long as you hold out not as long as we can look straight at each other like this he dropped into his chair what her answer really said was if you lift a finger youll drive me back back to all the abominations you know of and all the temptations you half guess he understood it as clearly as if she had uttered the words and the thought kept him anchored to his side of the table in a kind of moved and sacred submission what a life for you he groaned ohas long as its a part of yours and mine a part of yours she nodded and thats to be allfor either of us well it is all isnt it at that he sprang up forgetting everything but the sweetness of her face she rose too not as if to meet him or to flee from him but quietly as though the worst of the task were done and she had only to wait so quietly that as he came close her outstretched hands acted not as a check but as a guide to him they fell into his while her arms extended but not rigid kept him far enough off to let her surrendered face say the rest they may have stood in that way for a long time or only for a few moments but it was long enough for her silence to communicate all she had to say and for him to feel that only one thing mattered he must do nothing to make this meeting their last he must leave their future in her care asking only that she should keep fast hold of it dontdont be unhappy she said with a break in her voice as she drew her hands away and he answered you wont go backyou wont go back as if it were the one possibility he could not bear i wont go back she said and turning away she opened the door and led the way into the public diningroom the strident schoolteachers were gathering up their possessions preparatory to a straggling flight to the wharf across the beach lay the white steamboat at the pier and over the sunlit waters boston loomed in a line of haze once more on the boat and in the presence of others archer felt a tranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him the day according to any current valuation had been a rather ridiculous failure he had not so much as touched madame olenskas hand with his lips or extracted one word from her that gave promise of farther opportunities nevertheless for a man sick with unsatisfied love and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his passion he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted it was the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others and their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet tranquillized him a balance not artfully calculated as her tears and her falterings showed but resulting naturally from her unabashed sincerity it filled him with a tender awe now the danger was over and made him thank the fates that no personal vanity no sense of playing a part before sophisticated witnesses had tempted him to tempt her even after they had clasped hands for goodbye at the fall river station and he had turned away alone the conviction remained with him of having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed he wandered back to the club and went and sat alone in the deserted library turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second of their hours together it was clear to him and it grew more clear under closer scrutiny that if she should finally decide on returning to europereturning to her husbandit would not be because her old life tempted her even on the new terms offered no she would go only if she felt herself becoming a temptation to archer a temptation to fall away from the standard they had both set up her choice would be to stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer and it depended on himself to keep her just there safe but secluded in the train these thoughts were still with him they enclosed him in a kind of golden haze through which the faces about him looked remote and indistinct he had a feeling that if he spoke to his fellowtravellers they would not understand what he was saying in this state of abstraction he found himself the following morning waking to the reality of a stifling september day in new york the heatwithered faces in the long train streamed past him and he continued to stare at them through the same golden blur but suddenly as he left the station one of the faces detached itself came closer and forced itself upon his consciousness it was as he instantly recalled the face of the young man he had seen the day before passing out of the parker house and had noted as not conforming to type as not having an american hotel face the same thing struck him now and again he became aware of a dim stir of former associations the young man stood looking about him with the dazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of american travel then he advanced toward archer lifted his hat and said in english surely monsieur we met in london ah to be sure in london archer grasped his hand with curiosity and sympathy so you did get here after all he exclaimed casting a wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young carfrys french tutor oh i got hereyes m riviere smiled with drawn lips but not for long i return the day after tomorrow he stood grasping his light valise in one neatly gloved hand and gazing anxiously perplexedly almost appealingly into archers face i wonder monsieur since ive had the good luck to run across you if i might i was just going to suggest it come to luncheon wont you down town i mean if youll look me up in my office ill take you to a very decent restaurant in that quarter m riviere was visibly touched and surprised youre too kind but i was only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of conveyance there are no porters and no one here seems to listen i know our american stations must surprise you when you ask for a porter they give you chewinggum but if youll come along ill extricate you and you must really lunch with me you know the young man after a just perceptible hesitation replied with profuse thanks and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction that he was already engaged but when they had reached the comparative reassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon archer at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office fixed an hour and scribbled his address which the frenchman pocketed with reiterated thanks and a wide flourish of his hat a horsecar received him and archer walked away punctually at the hour m riviere appeared shaved smoothedout but still unmistakably drawn and serious archer was alone in his office and the young man before accepting the seat he proffered began abruptly i believe i saw you sir yesterday in boston the statement was insignificant enough and archer was about to frame an assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet illuminating in his visitors insistent gaze it is extraordinary very extraordinary m riviere continued that we should have met in the circumstances in which i find myself what circumstances archer asked wondering a little crudely if he needed money m riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes i have come not to look for employment as i spoke of doing when we last met but on a special mission ah archer exclaimed in a flash the two meetings had connected themselves in his mind he paused to take in the situation thus suddenly lighted up for him and m riviere also remained silent as if aware that what he had said was enough a special mission archer at length repeated the young frenchman opening his palms raised them slightly and the two men continued to look at each other across the officedesk till archer roused himself to say do sit down whereupon m riviere bowed took a distant chair and again waited it was about this mission that you wanted to consult me archer finally asked m riviere bent his head not in my own behalf on that score ii have fully dealt with myself i should likeif i mayto speak to you about the countess olenska archer had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming but when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he had been caught by a bentback branch in a thicket and on whose behalf he said do you wish to do this m riviere met the question sturdily welli might say hers if it did not sound like a liberty shall i say instead on behalf of abstract justice archer considered him ironically in other words you are count olenskis messenger he saw his blush more darkly reflected in m rivieres sallow countenance not to you monsieur if i come to you it is on quite other grounds what right have you in the circumstances to be on any other ground archer retorted if youre an emissary youre an emissary the young man considered my mission is over as far as the countess olenska goes it has failed i cant help that archer rejoined on the same note of irony no but you can help m riviere paused turned his hat about in his still carefully gloved hands looked into its lining and then back at archers face you can help monsieur i am convinced to make it equally a failure with her family archer pushed back his chair and stood up welland by god i will he exclaimed he stood with his hands in his pockets staring down wrathfully at the little frenchman whose face though he too had risen was still an inch or two below the line of archers eyes m riviere paled to his normal hue paler than that his complexion could hardly turn why the devil archer explosively continued should you have thoughtsince i suppose youre appealing to me on the ground of my relationship to madame olenskathat i should take a view contrary to the rest of her family the change of expression in m rivieres face was for a time his only answer his look passed from timidity to absolute distress for a young man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult to appear more disarmed and defenceless oh monsieur i cant imagine archer continued why you should have come to me when there are others so much nearer to the countess still less why you thought i should be more accessible to the arguments i suppose you were sent over with m riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility the arguments i want to present to you monsieur are my own and not those i was sent over with then i see still less reason for listening to them m riviere again looked into his hat as if considering whether these last words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone then he spoke with sudden decision monsieurwill you tell me one thing is it my right to be here that you question or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed his quiet insistence made archer feel the clumsiness of his own bluster m riviere had succeeded in imposing himself archer reddening slightly dropped into his chair again and signed to the young man to be seated i beg your pardon but why isnt the matter closed m riviere gazed back at him with anguish you do then agree with the rest of the family that in face of the new proposals i have brought it is hardly possible for madame olenska not to return to her husband good god archer exclaimed and his visitor gave out a low murmur of confirmation before seeing her i sawat count olenskis requestmr lovell mingott with whom i had several talks before going to boston i understand that he represents his mothers view and that mrs manson mingotts influence is great throughout her family archer sat silent with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding precipice the discovery that he had been excluded from a share in these negotiations and even from the knowledge that they were on foot caused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was learning he saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult him it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no longer on their side and he recalled with a start of comprehension a remark of mays during their drive home from mrs manson mingotts on the day of the archery meeting perhaps after all ellen would be happier with her husband even in the tumult of new discoveries archer remembered his indignant exclamation and the fact that since then his wife had never named madame olenska to him her careless allusion had no doubt been the straw held up to see which way the wind blew the result had been reported to the family and thereafter archer had been tacitly omitted from their counsels he admired the tribal discipline which made may bow to this decision she would not have done so he knew had her conscience protested but she probably shared the family view that madame olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a separated one and that there was no use in discussing the case with newland who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the most fundamental things for granted archer looked up and met his visitors anxious gaze dont you know monsieuris it possible you dont knowthat the family begin to doubt if they have the right to advise the countess to refuse her husbands last proposals the proposals you brought the proposals i brought it was on archers lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not know was no concern of m rivieres but something in the humble and yet courageous tenacity of m rivieres gaze made him reject this conclusion and he met the young mans question with another what is your object in speaking to me of this he had not to wait a moment for the answer to beg you monsieurto beg you with all the force im capable ofnot to let her go backoh dont let her m riviere exclaimed archer looked at him with increasing astonishment there was no mistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his determination he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the board but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record archer considered may i ask he said at length if this is the line you took with the countess olenska m riviere reddened but his eyes did not falter no monsieur i accepted my mission in good faith i really believedfor reasons i need not trouble you withthat it would be better for madame olenska to recover her situation her fortune the social consideration that her husbands standing gives her so i supposed you could hardly have accepted such a mission otherwise i should not have accepted it well then archer paused again and their eyes met in another protracted scrutiny ah monsieur after i had seen her after i had listened to her i knew she was better off here you knew monsieur i discharged my mission faithfully i put the counts arguments i stated his offers without adding any comment of my own the countess was good enough to listen patiently she carried her goodness so far as to see me twice she considered impartially all i had come to say and it was in the course of these two talks that i changed my mind that i came to see things differently may i ask what led to this change simply seeing the change in her m riviere replied the change in her then you knew her before the young mans colour again rose i used to see her in her husbands house i have known count olenski for many years you can imagine that he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission archers gaze wandering away to the blank walls of the office rested on a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the president of the united states that such a conversation should be going on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his rule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent the changewhat sort of a change ah monsieur if i could tell you m riviere paused tenezthe discovery i suppose of what id never thought of before that shes an american and that if youre an american of her kindof your kindthings that are accepted in certain other societies or at least put up with as part of a general convenient giveandtakebecome unthinkable simply unthinkable if madame olenskas relations understood what these things were their opposition to her returning would no doubt be as unconditional as her own but they seem to regard her husbands wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing for domestic life m riviere paused and then added whereas its far from being as simple as that archer looked back to the president of the united states and then down at his desk and at the papers scattered on it for a second or two he could not trust himself to speak during this interval he heard m rivieres chair pushed back and was aware that the young man had risen when he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved as himself thank you archer said simply theres nothing to thank me for monsieur it is i rather m riviere broke off as if speech for him too were difficult i should like though he continued in a firmer voice to add one thing you asked me if i was in count olenskis employ i am at this moment i returned to him a few months ago for reasons of private necessity such as may happen to any one who has persons ill and older persons dependent on him but from the moment that i have taken the step of coming here to say these things to you i consider myself discharged and i shall tell him so on my return and give him the reasons thats all monsieur m riviere bowed and drew back a step thank you archer said again as their hands met every year on the fifteenth of october fifth avenue opened its shutters unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of windowcurtains by the first of november this household ritual was over and society had begun to look about and take stock of itself by the fifteenth the season was in full blast opera and theatres were putting forth their new attractions dinnerengagements were accumulating and dates for dances being fixed and punctually at about this time mrs archer always said that new york was very much changed observing it from the lofty standpoint of a nonparticipant she was able with the help of mr sillerton jackson and miss sophy to trace each new crack in its surface and all the strange weeds pushing up between the ordered rows of social vegetables it had been one of the amusements of archers youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of his mothers and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of disintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked for new york to mrs archers mind never changed without changing for the worse and in this view miss sophy jackson heartily concurred mr sillerton jackson as became a man of the world suspended his judgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations of the ladies but even he never denied that new york had changed and newland archer in the winter of the second year of his marriage was himself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was certainly changing these points had been raised as usual at mrs archers thanksgiving dinner at the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks for the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful though not embittered stock of her world and wonder what there was to be thankful for at any rate not the state of society society if it could be said to exist was rather a spectacle on which to call down biblical imprecationsand in fact every one knew what the reverend dr ashmore meant when he chose a text from jeremiah chap ii verse 25 for his thanksgiving sermon dr ashmore the new rector of st matthews had been chosen because he was very advanced his sermons were considered bold in thought and novel in language when he fulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its trend and to mrs archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel herself part of a community that was trending theres no doubt that dr ashmore is right there is a marked trend she said as if it were something visible and measurable like a crack in a house it was odd though to preach about it on thanksgiving miss jackson opined and her hostess drily rejoined oh he means us to give thanks for whats left archer had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his mothers but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge as he listened to an enumeration of the changes that the trend was visible the extravagance in dress miss jackson began sillerton took me to the first night of the opera and i can only tell you that jane merrys dress was the only one i recognised from last year and even that had had the front panel changed yet i know she got it out from worth only two years ago because my seamstress always goes in to make over her paris dresses before she wears them ah jane merry is one of us said mrs archer sighing as if it were not such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning to flaunt abroad their paris dresses as soon as they were out of the custom house instead of letting them mellow under lock and key in the manner of mrs archers contemporaries yes shes one of the few in my youth miss jackson rejoined it was considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions and amy sillerton has always told me that in boston the rule was to put away ones paris dresses for two years old mrs baxter pennilow who did everything handsomely used to import twelve a year two velvet two satin two silk and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere it was a standing order and as she was ill for two years before she died they found fortyeight worth dresses that had never been taken out of tissue paper and when the girls left off their mourning they were able to wear the first lot at the symphony concerts without looking in advance of the fashion ah well boston is more conservative than new york but i always think its a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her french dresses for one season mrs archer conceded it was beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived i must say at times it takes all reginas distinction not to look like like miss jackson glanced around the table caught janeys bulging gaze and took refuge in an unintelligible murmur like her rivals said mr sillerton jackson with the air of producing an epigram oh the ladies murmured and mrs archer added partly to distract her daughters attention from forbidden topics poor regina her thanksgiving hasnt been a very cheerful one im afraid have you heard the rumours about beauforts speculations sillerton mr jackson nodded carelessly every one had heard the rumours in question and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common property a gloomy silence fell upon the party no one really liked beaufort and it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private life but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his wifes family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies archers new york tolerated hypocrisy in private relations but in business matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty it was a long time since any wellknown banker had failed discreditably but every one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the firm when the last event of the kind had happened it would be the same with the beauforts in spite of his power and her popularity not all the leagued strength of the dallas connection would save poor regina if there were any truth in the reports of her husbands unlawful speculations the talk took refuge in less ominous topics but everything they touched on seemed to confirm mrs archers sense of an accelerated trend of course newland i know you let dear may go to mrs strutherss sunday evenings she began and may interposed gaily oh you know everybody goes to mrs strutherss now and she was invited to grannys last reception it was thus archer reflected that new york managed its transitions conspiring to ignore them till they were well over and then in all good faith imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age there was always a traitor in the citadel and after he or generally she had surrendered the keys what was the use of pretending that it was impregnable once people had tasted of mrs strutherss easy sunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that her champagne was transmuted shoepolish i know dear i know mrs archer sighed such things have to be i suppose as long as amusement is what people go out for but ive never quite forgiven your cousin madame olenska for being the first person to countenance mrs struthers a sudden blush rose to young mrs archers face it surprised her husband as much as the other guests about the table oh ellen she murmured much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which her parents might have said oh the blenkers it was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention of the countess olenskas name since she had surprised and inconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husbands advances but on mays lips it gave food for thought and archer looked at her with the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was most in the tone of her environment his mother with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere still insisted ive always thought that people like the countess olenska who have lived in aristocratic societies ought to help us to keep up our social distinctions instead of ignoring them mays blush remained permanently vivid it seemed to have a significance beyond that implied by the recognition of madame olenskas social bad faith ive no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners said miss jackson tartly i dont think ellen cares for society but nobody knows exactly what she does care for may continued as if she had been groping for something noncommittal ah well mrs archer sighed again everybody knew that the countess olenska was no longer in the good graces of her family even her devoted champion old mrs manson mingott had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her husband the mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud their sense of solidarity was too strong they had simply as mrs welland said let poor ellen find her own leveland that mortifyingly and incomprehensibly was in the dim depths where the blenkers prevailed and people who wrote celebrated their untidy rites it was incredible but it was a fact that ellen in spite of all her opportunities and her privileges had become simply bohemian the fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in not returning to count olenski after all a young womans place was under her husbands roof especially when she had left it in circumstances that well if one had cared to look into them madame olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen said miss sophy with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when she knew that she was planting a dart ah thats the danger that a young woman like madame olenska is always exposed to mrs archer mournfully agreed and the ladies on this conclusion gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the drawingroom while archer and mr sillerton jackson withdrew to the gothic library once established before the grate and consoling himself for the inadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar mr jackson became portentous and communicable if the beaufort smash comes he announced there are going to be disclosures archer raised his head quickly he could never hear the name without the sharp vision of beauforts heavy figure opulently furred and shod advancing through the snow at skuytercliff theres bound to be mr jackson continued the nastiest kind of a cleaning up he hasnt spent all his money on regina oh wellthats discounted isnt it my belief is hell pull out yet said the young man wanting to change the subject perhapsperhaps i know he was to see some of the influential people today of course mr jackson reluctantly conceded its to be hoped they can tide him overthis time anyhow i shouldnt like to think of poor reginas spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign wateringplace for bankrupts archer said nothing it seemed to him so naturalhowever tragicthat money illgotten should be cruelly expiated that his mind hardly lingering over mrs beauforts doom wandered back to closer questions what was the meaning of mays blush when the countess olenska had been mentioned four months had passed since the midsummer day that he and madame olenska had spent together and since then he had not seen her he knew that she had returned to washington to the little house which she and medora manson had taken there he had written to her oncea few words asking when they were to meet againand she had even more briefly replied not yet since then there had been no farther communication between them and he had built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned among his secret thoughts and longings little by little it became the scene of his real life of his only rational activities thither he brought the books he read the ideas and feelings which nourished him his judgments and his visions outside it in the scene of his actual life he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency blundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absentminded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room absentthat was what he was so absent from everything most densely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him to find they still imagined he was there he became aware that mr jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to farther revelations i dont know of course how far your wifes family are aware of what people say aboutwell about madame olenskas refusal to accept her husbands latest offer archer was silent and mr jackson obliquely continued its a pityits certainly a pitythat she refused it a pity in gods name why mr jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it to a glossy pump wellto put it on the lowest groundwhats she going to live on now now if beaufort archer sprang up his fist banging down on the black walnutedge of the writingtable the wells of the brass doubleinkstand danced in their sockets what the devil do you mean sir mr jackson shifting himself slightly in his chair turned a tranquil gaze on the young mans burning face welli have it on pretty good authorityin fact on old catherines herselfthat the family reduced countess olenskas allowance considerably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband and as by this refusal she also forfeits the money settled on her when she marriedwhich olenski was ready to make over to her if she returnedwhy what the devil do you mean my dear boy by asking me what i mean mr jackson goodhumouredly retorted archer moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes into the grate i dont know anything of madame olenskas private affairs but i dont need to to be certain that what you insinuate oh i dont its lefferts for one mr jackson interposed leffertswho made love to her and got snubbed for it archer broke out contemptuously ahdid he snapped the other as if this were exactly the fact he had been laying a trap for he still sat sideways from the fire so that his hard old gaze held archers face as if in a spring of steel well well its a pity she didnt go back before beauforts cropper he repeated if she goes now and if he fails it will only confirm the general impression which isnt by any means peculiar to lefferts by the way oh she wont go back now less than ever archer had no sooner said it than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what mr jackson had been waiting for the old gentleman considered him attentively thats your opinion eh well no doubt you know but everybody will tell you that the few pennies medora manson has left are all in beauforts hands and how the two women are to keep their heads above water unless he does i cant imagine of course madame olenska may still soften old catherine whos been the most inexorably opposed to her staying and old catherine could make her any allowance she chooses but we all know that she hates parting with good money and the rest of the family have no particular interest in keeping madame olenska here archer was burning with unavailing wrath he was exactly in the state when a man is sure to do something stupid knowing all the while that he is doing it he saw that mr jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that madame olenskas differences with her grandmother and her other relations were not known to him and that the old gentleman had drawn his own conclusions as to the reasons for archers exclusion from the family councils this fact warned archer to go warily but the insinuations about beaufort made him reckless he was mindful however if not of his own danger at least of the fact that mr jackson was under his mothers roof and consequently his guest old new york scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality and no discussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a disagreement shall we go up and join my mother he suggested curtly as mr jacksons last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his elbow on the drive homeward may remained oddly silent through the darkness he still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush what its menace meant he could not guess but he was sufficiently warned by the fact that madame olenskas name had evoked it they went upstairs and he turned into the library she usually followed him but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom may he called out impatiently and she came back with a slight glance of surprise at his tone this lamp is smoking again i should think the servants might see that its kept properly trimmed he grumbled nervously im so sorry it shant happen again she answered in the firm bright tone she had learned from her mother and it exasperated archer to feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger mr welland she bent over to lower the wick and as the light struck up on her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought how young she is for what endless years this life will have to go on he felt with a kind of horror his own strong youth and the bounding blood in his veins look here he said suddenly i may have to go to washington for a few dayssoon next week perhaps her hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly the heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face but it paled as she looked up on business she asked in a tone which implied that there could be no other conceivable reason and that she had put the question automatically as if merely to finish his own sentence on business naturally theres a patent case coming up before the supreme court he gave the name of the inventor and went on furnishing details with all lawrence leffertss practised glibness while she listened attentively saying at intervals yes i see the change will do you good she said simply when he had finished and you must be sure to go and see ellen she added looking him straight in the eyes with her cloudless smile and speaking in the tone she might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome family duty it was the only word that passed between them on the subject but in the code in which they had both been trained it meant of course you understand that i know all that people have been saying about ellen and heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to return to her husband i also know that for some reason you have not chosen to tell me you have advised her against this course which all the older men of the family as well as our grandmother agree in approving and that it is owing to your encouragement that ellen defies us all and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which mr sillerton jackson probably gave you this evening the hint that has made you so irritable hints have indeed not been wanting but since you appear unwilling to take them from others i offer you this one myself in the only form in which wellbred people of our kind can communicate unpleasant things to each other by letting you understand that i know you mean to see ellen when you are in washington and are perhaps going there expressly for that purpose and that since you are sure to see her i wish you to do so with my full and explicit approvaland to take the opportunity of letting her know what the course of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to her hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this mute message reached him she turned the wick down lifted off the globe and breathed on the sulky flame they smell less if one blows them out she explained with her bright housekeeping air on the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss wall street the next day had more reassuring reports of beauforts situation they were not definite but they were hopeful it was generally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case of emergency and that he had done so with success and that evening when mrs beaufort appeared at the opera wearing her old smile and a new emerald necklace society drew a breath of relief new york was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities so far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who broke the law of probity must pay and every one was aware that even beaufort and beauforts wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this principle but to be obliged to offer them up would be not only painful but inconvenient the disappearance of the beauforts would leave a considerable void in their compact little circle and those who were too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe bewailed in advance the loss of the best ballroom in new york archer had definitely made up his mind to go to washington he was waiting only for the opening of the lawsuit of which he had spoken to may so that its date might coincide with that of his visit but on the following tuesday he learned from mr letterblair that the case might be postponed for several weeks nevertheless he went home that afternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening the chances were that may who knew nothing of his professional life and had never shown any interest in it would not learn of the postponement should it take place nor remember the names of the litigants if they were mentioned before her and at any rate he could no longer put off seeing madame olenska there were too many things that he must say to her on the wednesday morning when he reached his office mr letterblair met him with a troubled face beaufort after all had not managed to tide over but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he had reassured his depositors and heavy payments had poured into the bank till the previous evening when disturbing reports again began to predominate in consequence a run on the bank had begun and its doors were likely to close before the day was over the ugliest things were being said of beauforts dastardly manoeuvre and his failure promised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of wall street the extent of the calamity left mr letterblair white and incapacitated ive seen bad things in my time but nothing as bad as this everybody we know will be hit one way or another and what will be done about mrs beaufort what can be done about her i pity mrs manson mingott as much as anybody coming at her age theres no knowing what effect this affair may have on her she always believed in beaufortshe made a friend of him and theres the whole dallas connection poor mrs beaufort is related to every one of you her only chance would be to leave her husbandyet how can any one tell her so her duty is at his side and luckily she seems always to have been blind to his private weaknesses there was a knock and mr letterblair turned his head sharply what is it i cant be disturbed a clerk brought in a letter for archer and withdrew recognising his wifes hand the young man opened the envelope and read wont you please come up town as early as you can granny had a slight stroke last night in some mysterious way she found out before any one else this awful news about the bank uncle lovell is away shooting and the idea of the disgrace has made poor papa so nervous that he has a temperature and cant leave his room mamma needs you dreadfully and i do hope you can get away at once and go straight to grannys archer handed the note to his senior partner and a few minutes later was crawling northward in a crowded horsecar which he exchanged at fourteenth street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the fifth avenue line it was after twelve oclock when this laborious vehicle dropped him at old catherines the sittingroom window on the ground floor where she usually throned was tenanted by the inadequate figure of her daughter mrs welland who signed a haggard welcome as she caught sight of archer and at the door he was met by may the hall wore the unnatural appearance peculiar to wellkept houses suddenly invaded by illness wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs a doctors bag and overcoat were on the table and beside them letters and cards had already piled up unheeded may looked pale but smiling dr bencomb who had just come for the second time took a more hopeful view and mrs mingotts dauntless determination to live and get well was already having an effect on her family may led archer into the old ladys sittingroom where the sliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut and the heavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them and here mrs welland communicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the catastrophe it appeared that the evening before something dreadful and mysterious had happened at about eight oclock just after mrs mingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after dinner the doorbell had rung and a lady so thickly veiled that the servants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received the butler hearing a familiar voice had thrown open the sittingroom door announcing mrs julius beaufortand had then closed it again on the two ladies they must have been together he thought about an hour when mrs mingotts bell rang mrs beaufort had already slipped away unseen and the old lady white and vast and terrible sat alone in her great chair and signed to the butler to help her into her room she seemed at that time though obviously distressed in complete control of her body and brain the mulatto maid put her to bed brought her a cup of tea as usual laid everything straight in the room and went away but at three in the morning the bell rang again and the two servants hastening in at this unwonted summons for old catherine usually slept like a baby had found their mistress sitting up against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little hand hanging limp from its huge arm the stroke had clearly been a slight one for she was able to articulate and to make her wishes known and soon after the doctors first visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles but the alarm had been great and proportionately great was the indignation when it was gathered from mrs mingotts fragmentary phrases that regina beaufort had come to ask herincredible effronteryto back up her husband see them throughnot to desert them as she called itin fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their monstrous dishonour i said to her honours always been honour and honesty honesty in manson mingotts house and will be till im carried out of it feet first the old woman had stammered into her daughters ear in the thick voice of the partly paralysed and when she said but my name auntiemy names regina dallas i said it was beaufort when he covered you with jewels and its got to stay beaufort now that hes covered you with shame so much with tears and gasps of horror mrs welland imparted blanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to fix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable if only i could keep it from your fatherinlaw he always says augusta for pitys sake dont destroy my last illusionsand how am i to prevent his knowing these horrors the poor lady wailed after all mamma he wont have seen them her daughter suggested and mrs welland sighed ah no thank heaven hes safe in bed and dr bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor mamma is better and regina has been got away somewhere archer had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at the deserted thoroughfare it was evident that he had been summoned rather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any specific aid that he could render mr lovell mingott had been telegraphed for and messages were being despatched by hand to the members of the family living in new york and meanwhile there was nothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of beauforts dishonour and of his wifes unjustifiable action mrs lovell mingott who had been in another room writing notes presently reappeared and added her voice to the discussion in their day the elder ladies agreed the wife of a man who had done anything disgraceful in business had only one idea to efface herself to disappear with him there was the case of poor grandmamma spicer your greatgrandmother may of course mrs welland hastened to add your greatgrandfathers money difficulties were privatelosses at cards or signing a note for somebodyi never quite knew because mamma would never speak of it but she was brought up in the country because her mother had to leave new york after the disgrace whatever it was they lived up the hudson alone winter and summer till mamma was sixteen it would never have occurred to grandmamma spicer to ask the family to countenance her as i understand regina calls it though a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining hundreds of innocent people yes it would be more becoming in regina to hide her own countenance than to talk about other peoples mrs lovell mingott agreed i understand that the emerald necklace she wore at the opera last friday had been sent on approval from ball and blacks in the afternoon i wonder if theyll ever get it back archer listened unmoved to the relentless chorus the idea of absolute financial probity as the first law of a gentlemans code was too deeply ingrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it an adventurer like lemuel struthers might build up the millions of his shoe polish on any number of shady dealings but unblemished honesty was the noblesse oblige of old financial new york nor did mrs beauforts fate greatly move archer he felt no doubt more sorry for her than her indignant relatives but it seemed to him that the tie between husband and wife even if breakable in prosperity should be indissoluble in misfortune as mr letterblair had said a wifes place was at her husbands side when he was in trouble but societys place was not at his side and mrs beauforts cool assumption that it was seemed almost to make her his accomplice the mere idea of a womans appealing to her family to screen her husbands business dishonour was inadmissible since it was the one thing that the family as an institution could not do the mulatto maid called mrs lovell mingott into the hall and the latter came back in a moment with a frowning brow she wants me to telegraph for ellen olenska i had written to ellen of course and to medora but now it seems thats not enough im to telegraph to her immediately and to tell her that shes to come alone the announcement was received in silence mrs welland sighed resignedly and may rose from her seat and went to gather up some newspapers that had been scattered on the floor i suppose it must be done mrs lovell mingott continued as if hoping to be contradicted and may turned back toward the middle of the room of course it must be done she said granny knows what she wants and we must carry out all her wishes shall i write the telegram for you auntie if it goes at once ellen can probably catch tomorrow mornings train she pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness as if she had tapped on two silver bells well it cant go at once jasper and the pantryboy are both out with notes and telegrams may turned to her husband with a smile but heres newland ready to do anything will you take the telegram newland therell be just time before luncheon archer rose with a murmur of readiness and she seated herself at old catherines rosewood bonheur du jour and wrote out the message in her large immature hand when it was written she blotted it neatly and handed it to archer what a pity she said that you and ellen will cross each other on the waynewland she added turning to her mother and aunt is obliged to go to washington about a patent lawsuit that is coming up before the supreme court i suppose uncle lovell will be back by tomorrow night and with granny improving so much it doesnt seem right to ask newland to give up an important engagement for the firmdoes it she paused as if for an answer and mrs welland hastily declared oh of course not darling your granny would be the last person to wish it as archer left the room with the telegram he heard his motherinlaw add presumably to mrs lovell mingott but why on earth she should make you telegraph for ellen olenska and mays clear voice rejoin perhaps its to urge on her again that after all her duty is with her husband the outer door closed on archer and he walked hastily away toward the telegraph office ololhowjer spell it anyhow asked the tart young lady to whom archer had pushed his wifes telegram across the brass ledge of the western union office olenskaolenska he repeated drawing back the message in order to print out the foreign syllables above mays rambling script its an unlikely name for a new york telegraph office at least in this quarter an unexpected voice observed and turning around archer saw lawrence lefferts at his elbow pulling an imperturbable moustache and affecting not to glance at the message hallo newland thought id catch you here ive just heard of old mrs mingotts stroke and as i was on my way to the house i saw you turning down this street and nipped after you i suppose youve come from there archer nodded and pushed his telegram under the lattice very bad eh lefferts continued wiring to the family i suppose i gather it is bad if youre including countess olenska archers lips stiffened he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into the long vain handsome face at his side why he questioned lefferts who was known to shrink from discussion raised his eyebrows with an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel behind the lattice nothing could be worse form the look reminded archer than any display of temper in a public place archer had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form but his impulse to do lawrence lefferts a physical injury was only momentary the idea of bandying ellen olenskas name with him at such a time and on whatsoever provocation was unthinkable he paid for his telegram and the two young men went out together into the street there archer having regained his selfcontrol went on mrs mingott is much better the doctor feels no anxiety whatever and lefferts with profuse expressions of relief asked him if he had heard that there were beastly bad rumours again about beaufort that afternoon the announcement of the beaufort failure was in all the papers it overshadowed the report of mrs manson mingotts stroke and only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the two events thought of ascribing old catherines illness to anything but the accumulation of flesh and years the whole of new york was darkened by the tale of beauforts dishonour there had never as mr letterblair said been a worse case in his memory nor for that matter in the memory of the faroff letterblair who had given his name to the firm the bank had continued to take in money for a whole day after its failure was inevitable and as many of its clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans beauforts duplicity seemed doubly cynical if mrs beaufort had not taken the tone that such misfortunes the word was her own were the test of friendship compassion for her might have tempered the general indignation against her husband as it wasand especially after the object of her nocturnal visit to mrs manson mingott had become knownher cynicism was held to exceed his and she had not the excusenor her detractors the satisfactionof pleading that she was a foreigner it was some comfort to those whose securities were not in jeopardy to be able to remind themselves that beaufort was but after all if a dallas of south carolina took his view of the case and glibly talked of his soon being on his feet again the argument lost its edge and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence of the indissolubility of marriage society must manage to get on without the beauforts and there was an end of itexcept indeed for such hapless victims of the disaster as medora manson the poor old miss lannings and certain other misguided ladies of good family who if only they had listened to mr henry van der luyden the best thing the beauforts can do said mrs archer summing it up as if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of treatment is to go and live at reginas little place in north carolina beaufort has always kept a racing stable and he had better breed trotting horses i should say he had all the qualities of a successful horsedealer every one agreed with her but no one condescended to enquire what the beauforts really meant to do the next day mrs manson mingott was much better she recovered her voice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the beauforts to her again and askedwhen dr bencomb appearedwhat in the world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health if people of my age will eat chickensalad in the evening what are they to expect she enquired and the doctor having opportunely modified her dietary the stroke was transformed into an attack of indigestion but in spite of her firm tone old catherine did not wholly recover her former attitude toward life the growing remoteness of old age though it had not diminished her curiosity about her neighbours had blunted her never very lively compassion for their troubles and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the beaufort disaster out of her mind but for the first time she became absorbed in her own symptoms and began to take a sentimental interest in certain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been contemptuously indifferent mr welland in particular had the privilege of attracting her notice of her sonsinlaw he was the one she had most consistently ignored and all his wifes efforts to represent him as a man of forceful character and marked intellectual ability if he had only chosen had been met with a derisive chuckle but his eminence as a valetudinarian now made him an object of engrossing interest and mrs mingott issued an imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his temperature permitted for old catherine was now the first to recognise that one could not be too careful about temperatures twentyfour hours after madame olenskas summons a telegram announced that she would arrive from washington on the evening of the following day at the wellands where the newland archers chanced to be lunching the question as to who should meet her at jersey city was immediately raised and the material difficulties amid which the welland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost lent animation to the debate it was agreed that mrs welland could not possibly go to jersey city because she was to accompany her husband to old catherines that afternoon and the brougham could not be spared since if mr welland were upset by seeing his motherinlaw for the first time after her attack he might have to be taken home at a moments notice the welland sons would of course be down town mr lovell mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting and the mingott carriage engaged in meeting him and one could not ask may at the close of a winter afternoon to go alone across the ferry to jersey city even in her own carriage nevertheless it might appear inhospitableand contrary to old catherines express wishesif madame olenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the station to receive her it was just like ellen mrs wellands tired voice implied to place the family in such a dilemma its always one thing after another the poor lady grieved in one of her rare revolts against fate the only thing that makes me think mamma must be less well than dr bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have ellen come at once however inconvenient it is to meet her the words had been thoughtless as the utterances of impatience often are and mr welland was upon them with a pounce augusta he said turning pale and laying down his fork have you any other reason for thinking that bencomb is less to be relied on than he was have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than usual in following up my case or your mothers it was mrs wellands turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of her blunder unrolled themselves before her but she managed to laugh and take a second helping of scalloped oysters before she said struggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness my dear how could you imagine such a thing i only meant that after the decided stand mamma took about its being ellens duty to go back to her husband it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden whim to see her when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that she might have asked for but we must never forget that mamma in spite of her wonderful vitality is a very old woman mr wellands brow remained clouded and it was evident that his perturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark yes your mothers a very old woman and for all we know bencomb may not be as successful with very old people as you say my dear its always one thing after another and in another ten or fifteen years i suppose i shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor its always better to make such a change before its absolutely necessary and having arrived at this spartan decision mr welland firmly took up his fork but all the while mrs welland began again as she rose from the luncheontable and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and malachite known as the back drawingroom i dont see how ellens to be got here tomorrow evening and i do like to have things settled for at least twentyfour hours ahead archer turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting representing two cardinals carousing in an octagonal ebony frame set with medallions of onyx shall i fetch her he proposed i can easily get away from the office in time to meet the brougham at the ferry if may will send it there his heart was beating excitedly as he spoke mrs welland heaved a sigh of gratitude and may who had moved away to the window turned to shed on him a beam of approval so you see mamma everything will be settled twentyfour hours in advance she said stooping over to kiss her mothers troubled forehead mays brougham awaited her at the door and she was to drive archer to union square where he could pick up a broadway car to carry him to the office as she settled herself in her corner she said i didnt want to worry mamma by raising fresh obstacles but how can you meet ellen tomorrow and bring her back to new york when youre going to washington oh im not going archer answered not going why whats happened her voice was as clear as a bell and full of wifely solicitude the case is offpostponed postponed how odd i saw a note this morning from mr letterblair to mamma saying that he was going to washington tomorrow for the big patent case that he was to argue before the supreme court you said it was a patent case didnt you wellthats it the whole office cant go letterblair decided to go this morning then its not postponed she continued with an insistence so unlike her that he felt the blood rising to his face as if he were blushing for her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies no but my going is he answered cursing the unnecessary explanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of going to washington and wondering where he had read that clever liars give details but that the cleverest do not it did not hurt him half as much to tell may an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she had not detected him im not going till later on luckily for the convenience of your family he continued taking base refuge in sarcasm as he spoke he felt that she was looking at him and he turned his eyes to hers in order not to appear to be avoiding them their glances met for a second and perhaps let them into each others meanings more deeply than either cared to go yes it is awfully convenient may brightly agreed that you should be able to meet ellen after all you saw how much mamma appreciated your offering to do it oh im delighted to do it the carriage stopped and as he jumped out she leaned to him and laid her hand on his goodbye dearest she said her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone on him through tears he turned away and hurried across union square repeating to himself in a sort of inward chant its all of two hours from jersey city to old catherines its all of two hoursand it may be more his wifes dark blue brougham with the wedding varnish still on it met archer at the ferry and conveyed him luxuriously to the pennsylvania terminus in jersey city it was a sombre snowy afternoon and the gaslamps were lit in the big reverberating station as he paced the platform waiting for the washington express he remembered that there were people who thought there would one day be a tunnel under the hudson through which the trains of the pennsylvania railway would run straight into new york they were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the building of ships that would cross the atlantic in five days the invention of a flying machine lighting by electricity telephonic communication without wires and other arabian night marvels i dont care which of their visions comes true archer mused as long as the tunnel isnt built yet in his senseless schoolboy happiness he pictured madame olenskas descent from the train his discovery of her a long way off among the throngs of meaningless faces her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage their slow approach to the wharf among slipping horses laden carts vociferating teamsters and then the startling quiet of the ferryboat where they would sit side by side under the snow in the motionless carriage while the earth seemed to glide away under them rolling to the other side of the sun it was incredible the number of things he had to say to her and in what eloquent order they were forming themselves on his lips the clanging and groaning of the train came nearer and it staggered slowly into the station like a preyladen monster into its lair archer pushed forward elbowing through the crowd and staring blindly into window after window of the highhung carriages and then suddenly he saw madame olenskas pale and surprised face close at hand and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what she looked like they reached each other their hands met and he drew her arm through his this wayi have the carriage he said after that it all happened as he had dreamed he helped her into the brougham with her bags and had afterward the vague recollection of having properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a summary of the beaufort situation he was struck by the softness of her poor regina meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out of the coil about the station and they were crawling down the slippery incline to the wharf menaced by swaying coalcarts bewildered horses dishevelled expresswagons and an empty hearseah that hearse she shut her eyes as it passed and clutched at archers hand if only it doesnt meanpoor granny oh no noshes much bettershes all right really thereweve passed it he exclaimed as if that made all the difference her hand remained in his and as the carriage lurched across the gangplank onto the ferry he bent over unbuttoned her tight brown glove and kissed her palm as if he had kissed a relic she disengaged herself with a faint smile and he said you didnt expect me today oh no i meant to go to washington to see you id made all my arrangementsi very nearly crossed you in the train oh she exclaimed as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape do you knowi hardly remembered you hardly remembered me i mean how shall i explain iits always so each time you happen to me all over again oh yes i know i know does itdo i too to you he insisted she nodded looking out of the window ellenellenellen she made no answer and he sat in silence watching her profile grow indistinct against the snowstreaked dusk beyond the window what had she been doing in all those four long months he wondered how little they knew of each other after all the precious moments were slipping away but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her and could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and their proximity which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their sitting so close to each other and yet being unable to see each others faces what a pretty carriage is it mays she asked suddenly turning her face from the window yes it was may who sent you to fetch me then how kind of her he made no answer for a moment then he said explosively your husbands secretary came to see me the day after we met in boston in his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to m rivieres visit and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom but her reminder that they were in his wifes carriage provoked him to an impulse of retaliation he would see if she liked his reference to riviere any better than he liked hers to may as on certain other occasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure she betrayed no sign of surprise and at once he concluded he writes to her then m riviere went to see you yes didnt you know no she answered simply and youre not surprised she hesitated why should i be he told me in boston that he knew you that hed met you in england i think elleni must ask you one thing yes i wanted to ask it after i saw him but i couldnt put it in a letter it was riviere who helped you to get awaywhen you left your husband his heart was beating suffocatingly would she meet this question with the same composure yes i owe him a great debt she answered without the least tremor in her quiet voice her tone was so natural so almost indifferent that archers turmoil subsided once more she had managed by her sheer simplicity to make him feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging convention to the winds i think youre the most honest woman i ever met he exclaimed oh nobut probably one of the least fussy she answered a smile in her voice call it what you like you look at things as they are ahive had to ive had to look at the gorgon wellit hasnt blinded you youve seen that shes just an old bogey like all the others she doesnt blind one but she dries up ones tears the answer checked the pleading on archers lips it seemed to come from depths of experience beyond his reach the slow advance of the ferryboat had ceased and her bows bumped against the piles of the slip with a violence that made the brougham stagger and flung archer and madame olenska against each other the young man trembling felt the pressure of her shoulder and passed his arm about her if youre not blind then you must see that this cant last what cant our being togetherand not together no you ought not to have come today she said in an altered voice and suddenly she turned flung her arms about him and pressed her lips to his at the same moment the carriage began to move and a gaslamp at the head of the slip flashed its light into the window she drew away and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled through the congestion of carriages about the ferrylanding as they gained the street archer began to speak hurriedly dont be afraid of me you neednt squeeze yourself back into your corner like that a stolen kiss isnt what i want look im not even trying to touch the sleeve of your jacket dont suppose that i dont understand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us dwindle into an ordinary holeandcorner loveaffair i couldnt have spoken like this yesterday because when weve been apart and im looking forward to seeing you every thought is burnt up in a great flame but then you come and youre so much more than i remembered and what i want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then with wastes of thirsty waiting between that i can sit perfectly still beside you like this with that other vision in my mind just quietly trusting to it to come true for a moment she made no reply then she asked hardly above a whisper what do you mean by trusting to it to come true whyyou know it will dont you your vision of you and me together she burst into a sudden hard laugh you choose your place well to put it to me do you mean because were in my wifes brougham shall we get out and walk then i dont suppose you mind a little snow she laughed again more gently no i shant get out and walk because my business is to get to grannys as quickly as i can and youll sit beside me and well look not at visions but at realities i dont know what you mean by realities the only reality to me is this she met the words with a long silence during which the carriage rolled down an obscure sidestreet and then turned into the searching illumination of fifth avenue is it your idea then that i should live with you as your mistresssince i cant be your wife she asked the crudeness of the question startled him the word was one that women of his class fought shy of even when their talk flitted closest about the topic he noticed that madame olenska pronounced it as if it had a recognised place in her vocabulary and he wondered if it had been used familiarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from her question pulled him up with a jerk and he floundered i wanti want somehow to get away with you into a world where words like thatcategories like thatwont exist where we shall be simply two human beings who love each other who are the whole of life to each other and nothing else on earth will matter she drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh oh my dearwhere is that country have you ever been there she asked and as he remained sullenly dumb she went on i know so many whove tried to find it and believe me they all got out by mistake at wayside stations at places like boulogne or pisa or monte carloand it wasnt at all different from the old world theyd left but only rather smaller and dingier and more promiscuous he had never heard her speak in such a tone and he remembered the phrase she had used a little while before yes the gorgon has dried your tears he said well she opened my eyes too its a delusion to say that she blinds people what she does is just the contraryshe fastens their eyelids open so that theyre never again in the blessed darkness isnt there a chinese torture like that there ought to be ah believe me its a miserable little country the carriage had crossed fortysecond street mays sturdy broughamhorse was carrying them northward as if he had been a kentucky trotter archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words then what exactly is your plan for us he asked for us but theres no us in that sense were near each other only if we stay far from each other then we can be ourselves otherwise were only newland archer the husband of ellen olenskas cousin and ellen olenska the cousin of newland archers wife trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them ah im beyond that he groaned no youre not youve never been beyond and i have she said in a strange voice and i know what it looks like there he sat silent dazed with inarticulate pain then he groped in the darkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to the coachman he remembered that may rang twice when she wished to stop he pressed the bell and the carriage drew up beside the curbstone why are we stopping this is not grannys madame olenska exclaimed no i shall get out here he stammered opening the door and jumping to the pavement by the light of a streetlamp he saw her startled face and the instinctive motion she made to detain him he closed the door and leaned for a moment in the window youre right i ought not to have come today he said lowering his voice so that the coachman should not hear she bent forward and seemed about to speak but he had already called out the order to drive on and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner the snow was over and a tingling wind had sprung up that lashed his face as he stood gazing suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his lashes and perceived that he had been crying and that the wind had frozen his tears he thrust his hands in his pockets and walked at a sharp pace down fifth avenue to his own house that evening when archer came down before dinner he found the drawingroom empty he and may were dining alone all the family engagements having been postponed since mrs manson mingotts illness and as may was the more punctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him he knew that she was at home for while he dressed he had heard her moving about in her room and he wondered what had delayed her he had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means of tying his thoughts fast to reality sometimes he felt as if he had found the clue to his fatherinlaws absorption in trifles perhaps even mr welland long ago had had escapes and visions and had conjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them when may appeared he thought she looked tired she had put on the lownecked and tightlylaced dinnerdress which the mingott ceremonial exacted on the most informal occasions and had built her fair hair into its usual accumulated coils and her face in contrast was wan and almost faded but she shone on him with her usual tenderness and her eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before what became of you dear she asked i was waiting at grannys and ellen came alone and said she had dropped you on the way because you had to rush off on business theres nothing wrong only some letters id forgotten and wanted to get off before dinner ah she said and a moment afterward im sorry you didnt come to grannysunless the letters were urgent they were he rejoined surprised at her insistence besides i dont see why i should have gone to your grandmothers i didnt know you were there she turned and moved to the lookingglass above the mantelpiece as she stood there lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped from its place in her intricate hair archer was struck by something languid and inelastic in her attitude and wondered if the deadly monotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also then he remembered that as he had left the house that morning she had called over the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmothers so that they might drive home together he had called back a cheery yes and then absorbed in other visions had forgotten his promise now he was smitten with compunction yet irritated that so trifling an omission should be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage he was weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon without the temperature of passion yet with all its exactions if may had spoken out her grievances he suspected her of many he might have laughed them away but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a spartan smile to disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was and she answered that mrs mingott was still improving but had been rather disturbed by the last news about the beauforts what news it seems theyre going to stay in new york i believe hes going into an insurance business or something theyre looking about for a small house the preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion and they went in to dinner during dinner their talk moved in its usual limited circle but archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to madame olenska nor to old catherines reception of her he was thankful for the fact yet felt it to be vaguely ominous they went up to the library for coffee and archer lit a cigar and took down a volume of michelet he had taken to history in the evenings since may had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she saw him with a volume of poetry not that he disliked the sound of his own voice but because he could always foresee her comments on what he read in the days of their engagement she had simply as he now perceived echoed what he told her but since he had ceased to provide her with opinions she had begun to hazard her own with results destructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on seeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket drew up an armchair to the greenshaded student lamp and uncovered a cushion she was embroidering for his sofa she was not a clever needlewoman her large capable hands were made for riding rowing and openair activities but since other wives embroidered cushions for their husbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion she was so placed that archer by merely raising his eyes could see her bent above her workframe her ruffled elbowsleeves slipping back from her firm round arms the betrothal sapphire shining on her left hand above her broad gold weddingring and the right hand slowly and laboriously stabbing the canvas as she sat thus the lamplight full on her clear brow he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it that never in all the years to come would she surprise him by an unexpected mood by a new idea a weakness a cruelty or an emotion she had spent her poetry and romance on their short courting the function was exhausted because the need was past now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother and mysteriously by the very process trying to turn him into a mr welland he laid down his book and stood up impatiently and at once she raised her head whats the matter the room is stifling i want a little air he had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and forward on a rod so that they might be closed in the evening instead of remaining nailed to a gilt cornice and immovably looped up over layers of lace as in the drawingroom and he pulled them back and pushed up the sash leaning out into the icy night the mere fact of not looking at may seated beside his table under his lamp the fact of seeing other houses roofs chimneys of getting the sense of other lives outside his own other cities beyond new york and a whole world beyond his world cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe after he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard her say newland do shut the window youll catch your death he pulled the sash down and turned back catch my death he echoed and he felt like adding but ive caught it already i am deadive been dead for months and months and suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion what if it were she who was dead if she were going to dieto die soonand leave him free the sensation of standing there in that warm familiar room and looking at her and wishing her dead was so strange so fascinating and overmastering that its enormity did not immediately strike him he simply felt that chance had given him a new possibility to which his sick soul might cling yes may might diepeople did young people healthy people like herself she might die and set him suddenly free she glanced up and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be something strange in his own newland are you ill he shook his head and turned toward his armchair she bent over her workframe and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair poor may he said poor why poor she echoed with a strained laugh because i shall never be able to open a window without worrying you he rejoined laughing also for a moment she was silent then she said very low her head bowed over her work i shall never worry if youre happy ah my dear and i shall never be happy unless i can open the windows in this weather she remonstrated and with a sigh he buried his head in his book six or seven days passed archer heard nothing from madame olenska and became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence by any member of the family he did not try to see her to do so while she was at old catherines guarded bedside would have been almost impossible in the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift conscious somewhere below the surface of his thoughts of a resolve which had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window into the icy night the strength of that resolve made it easy to wait and make no sign then one day may told him that mrs manson mingott had asked to see him there was nothing surprising in the request for the old lady was steadily recovering and she had always openly declared that she preferred archer to any of her other grandsonsinlaw may gave the message with evident pleasure she was proud of old catherines appreciation of her husband there was a moments pause and then archer felt it incumbent on him to say all right shall we go together this afternoon his wifes face brightened but she instantly answered oh youd much better go alone it bores granny to see the same people too often archers heart was beating violently when he rang old mrs mingotts bell he had wanted above all things to go alone for he felt sure the visit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the countess olenska he had determined to wait till the chance presented itself naturally and here it was and here he was on the doorstep behind the door behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to the hall she was surely awaiting him in another moment he should see her and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sickroom he wanted only to put one question after that his course would be clear what he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to washington and that question she could hardly refuse to answer but in the yellow sittingroom it was the mulatto maid who waited her white teeth shining like a keyboard she pushed back the sliding doors and ushered him into old catherines presence the old woman sat in a vast thronelike armchair near her bed beside her was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved globe over which a green paper shade had been balanced there was not a book or a newspaper in reach nor any evidence of feminine employment conversation had always been mrs mingotts sole pursuit and she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork archer saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke she merely looked paler with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of her obesity and in the fluted mobcap tied by a starched bow between her first two chins and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing purple dressinggown she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress of her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the table she held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her huge lap like pet animals and called to the maid dont let in any one else if my daughters call say im asleep the maid disappeared and the old lady turned to her grandson my dear am i perfectly hideous she asked gaily launching out one hand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom my daughters tell me it doesnt matter at my ageas if hideousness didnt matter all the more the harder it gets to conceal my dear youre handsomer than ever archer rejoined in the same tone and she threw back her head and laughed ah but not as handsome as ellen she jerked out twinkling at him maliciously and before he could answer she added was she so awfully handsome the day you drove her up from the ferry he laughed and she continued was it because you told her so that she had to put you out on the way in my youth young men didnt desert pretty women unless they were made to she gave another chuckle and interrupted it to say almost querulously its a pity she didnt marry you i always told her so it would have spared me all this worry but who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry archer wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties but suddenly she broke out well its settled anyhow shes going to stay with me whatever the rest of the family say she hadnt been here five minutes before id have gone down on my knees to keep herif only for the last twenty years id been able to see where the floor was archer listened in silence and she went on theyd talked me over as no doubt you know persuaded me lovell and letterblair and augusta welland and all the rest of them that i must hold out and cut off her allowance till she was made to see that it was her duty to go back to olenski they thought theyd convinced me when the secretary or whatever he was came out with the last proposals handsome proposals i confess they were after all marriage is marriage and moneys moneyboth useful things in their way and i didnt know what to answer she broke off and drew a long breath as if speaking had become an effort but the minute i laid eyes on her i said you sweet bird you shut you up in that cage again never and now its settled that shes to stay here and nurse her granny as long as theres a granny to nurse its not a gay prospect but she doesnt mind and of course ive told letterblair that shes to be given her proper allowance the young man heard her with veins aglow but in his confusion of mind he hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain he had so definitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment he could not readjust his thoughts but gradually there stole over him the delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities miraculously provided if ellen had consented to come and live with her grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the impossibility of giving him up this was her answer to his final appeal of the other day if she would not take the extreme step he had urged she had at last yielded to halfmeasures he sank back into the thought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk everything and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security she couldnt have gone backit was impossible he exclaimed ah my dear i always knew you were on her side and thats why i sent for you today and why i said to your pretty wife when she proposed to come with you no my dear im pining to see newland and i dont want anybody to share our transports for you see my dear she drew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted and looked him full in the eyesyou see we shall have a fight yet the family dont want her here and theyll say its because ive been ill because im a weak old woman that shes persuaded me im not well enough yet to fight them one by one and youve got to do it for me i he stammered you why not she jerked back at him her round eyes suddenly as sharp as penknives her hand fluttered from its chairarm and lit on his with a clutch of little pale nails like birdclaws why not she searchingly repeated archer under the exposure of her gaze had recovered his selfpossession oh i dont countim too insignificant well youre letterblairs partner aint you youve got to get at them through letterblair unless youve got a reason she insisted oh my dear i back you to hold your own against them all without my help but you shall have it if you need it he reassured her then were safe she sighed and smiling on him with all her ancient cunning she added as she settled her head among the cushions i always knew youd back us up because they never quote you when they talk about its being her duty to go home he winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity and longed to ask and maydo they quote her but he judged it safer to turn the question and madame olenska when am i to see her he said the old lady chuckled crumpled her lids and went through the pantomime of archness not today one at a time please madame olenskas gone out he flushed with disappointment and she went on shes gone out my child gone in my carriage to see regina beaufort she paused for this announcement to produce its effect thats what shes reduced me to already the day after she got here she put on her best bonnet and told me as cool as a cucumber that she was going to call on regina beaufort i dont know her who is she says i shes your grandniece and a most unhappy woman she says shes the wife of a scoundrel i answered well she says and so am i and yet all my family want me to go back to him well that floored me and i let her go and finally one day she said it was raining too hard to go out on foot and she wanted me to lend her my carriage what for i asked her and she said to go and see cousin reginacousin now my dear i looked out of the window and saw it wasnt raining a drop but i understood her and i let her have the carriage after all reginas a brave woman and so is she and ive always liked courage above everything archer bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay on his eheheh whose hand did you think you were kissing young manyour wifes i hope the old lady snapped out with her mocking cackle and as he rose to go she called out after him give her her grannys love but youd better not say anything about our talk archer had been stunned by old catherines news it was only natural that madame olenska should have hastened from washington in response to her grandmothers summons but that she should have decided to remain under her roofespecially now that mrs mingott had almost regained her healthwas less easy to explain archer was sure that madame olenskas decision had not been influenced by the change in her financial situation he knew the exact figure of the small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation without the addition of her grandmothers allowance it was hardly enough to live on in any sense known to the mingott vocabulary and now that medora manson who shared her life had been ruined such a pittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed yet archer was convinced that madame olenska had not accepted her grandmothers offer from interested motives she had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of persons used to large fortunes and indifferent to money but she could go without many things which her relations considered indispensable and mrs lovell mingott and mrs welland had often been heard to deplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of count olenskis establishments should care so little about how things were done moreover as archer knew several months had passed since her allowance had been cut off yet in the interval she had made no effort to regain her grandmothers favour therefore if she had changed her course it must be for a different reason he did not have far to seek for that reason on the way from the ferry she had told him that he and she must remain apart but she had said it with her head on his breast he knew that there was no calculated coquetry in her words she was fighting her fate as he had fought his and clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break faith with the people who trusted them but during the ten days which had elapsed since her return to new york she had perhaps guessed from his silence and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her that he was meditating a decisive step a step from which there was no turning back at the thought a sudden fear of her own weakness might have seized her and she might have felt that after all it was better to accept the compromise usual in such cases and follow the line of least resistance an hour earlier when he had rung mrs mingotts bell archer had fancied that his path was clear before him he had meant to have a word alone with madame olenska and failing that to learn from her grandmother on what day and by which train she was returning to washington in that train he intended to join her and travel with her to washington or as much farther as she was willing to go his own fancy inclined to japan at any rate she would understand at once that wherever she went he was going he meant to leave a note for may that should cut off any other alternative he had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to take it yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was changed had been one of relief now however as he walked home from mrs mingotts he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay before him there was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was presumably to tread but when he had trodden it before it was as a free man who was accountable to no one for his actions and could lend himself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and prevarications concealments and compliances that the part required this procedure was called protecting a womans honour and the best fiction combined with the afterdinner talk of his elders had long since initiated him into every detail of its code now he saw the matter in a new light and his part in it seemed singularly diminished it was in fact that which with a secret fatuity he had watched mrs thorley rushworth play toward a fond and unperceiving husband a smiling bantering humouring watchful and incessant lie a lie by day a lie by night a lie in every touch and every look a lie in every caress and every quarrel a lie in every word and in every silence it was easier and less dastardly on the whole for a wife to play such a part toward her husband a womans standard of truthfulness was tacitly held to be lower she was the subject creature and versed in the arts of the enslaved then she could always plead moods and nerves and the right not to be held too strictly to account and even in the most straitlaced societies the laugh was always against the husband but in archers little world no one laughed at a wife deceived and a certain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their philandering after marriage in the rotation of crops there was a recognised season for wild oats but they were not to be sown more than once archer had always shared this view in his heart he thought lefferts despicable but to love ellen olenska was not to become a man like lefferts for the first time archer found himself face to face with the dread argument of the individual case ellen olenska was like no other woman he was like no other man their situation therefore resembled no one elses and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of their own judgment yes but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep and there were may and habit and honour and all the old decencies that he and his people had always believed in at his corner he hesitated and then walked on down fifth avenue ahead of him in the winter night loomed a big unlit house as he drew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights its steps awninged and carpeted and carriages waiting in double line to draw up at the curbstone it was in the conservatory that stretched its deadblack bulk down the side street that he had taken his first kiss from may it was under the myriad candles of the ballroom that he had seen her appear tall and silvershining as a young diana now the house was as dark as the grave except for a faint flare of gas in the basement and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had not been lowered as archer reached the corner he saw that the carriage standing at the door was mrs manson mingotts what an opportunity for sillerton jackson if he should chance to pass archer had been greatly moved by old catherines account of madame olenskas attitude toward mrs beaufort it made the righteous reprobation of new york seem like a passing by on the other side but he knew well enough what construction the clubs and drawingrooms would put on ellen olenskas visits to her cousin he paused and looked up at the lighted window no doubt the two women were sitting together in that room beaufort had probably sought consolation elsewhere there were even rumours that he had left new york with fanny ring but mrs beauforts attitude made the report seem improbable archer had the nocturnal perspective of fifth avenue almost to himself at that hour most people were indoors dressing for dinner and he was secretly glad that ellens exit was likely to be unobserved as the thought passed through his mind the door opened and she came out behind her was a faint light such as might have been carried down the stairs to show her the way she turned to say a word to some one then the door closed and she came down the steps ellen he said in a low voice as she reached the pavement she stopped with a slight start and just then he saw two young men of fashionable cut approaching there was a familiar air about their overcoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their white ties and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be dining out so early then he remembered that the reggie chiverses whose house was a few doors above were taking a large party that evening to see adelaide neilson in romeo and juliet and guessed that the two were of the number they passed under a lamp and he recognised lawrence lefferts and a young chivers a mean desire not to have madame olenska seen at the beauforts door vanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand i shall see you nowwe shall be together he broke out hardly knowing what he said ah she answered granny has told you while he watched her he was aware that lefferts and chivers on reaching the farther side of the street corner had discreetly struck away across fifth avenue it was the kind of masculine solidarity that he himself often practised now he sickened at their connivance did she really imagine that he and she could live like this and if not what else did she imagine tomorrow i must see yousomewhere where we can be alone he said in a voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears she wavered and moved toward the carriage but i shall be at grannysfor the present that is she added as if conscious that her change of plans required some explanation somewhere where we can be alone he insisted she gave a faint laugh that grated on him in new york but there are no churches no monuments theres the art museumin the park he explained as she looked puzzled at halfpast two i shall be at the door she turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage as it drove off she leaned forward and he thought she waved her hand in the obscurity he stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory feelings it seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman he loved but to another a woman he was indebted to for pleasures already wearied of it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this hackneyed vocabulary shell come he said to himself almost contemptuously avoiding the popular wolfe collection whose anecdotic canvases filled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of castiron and encaustic tiles known as the metropolitan museum they had wandered down a passage to the room where the cesnola antiquities mouldered in unvisited loneliness they had this melancholy retreat to themselves and seated on the divan enclosing the central steamradiator they were staring silently at the glass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered fragments of ilium its odd madame olenska said i never came here before ah well some day i suppose it will be a great museum yes she assented absently she stood up and wandered across the room archer remaining seated watched the light movements of her figure so girlish even under its heavy furs the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap and the way a dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the ear his mind as always when they first met was wholly absorbed in the delicious details that made her herself and no other presently he rose and approached the case before which she stood its glass shelves were crowded with small broken objectshardly recognisable domestic utensils ornaments and personal triflesmade of glass of clay of discoloured bronze and other timeblurred substances it seems cruel she said that after a while nothing matters any more than these little things that used to be necessary and important to forgotten people and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying glass and labelled use unknown yes but meanwhile ah meanwhile as she stood there in her long sealskin coat her hands thrust in a small round muff her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the tip of her nose and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring with her quicklytaken breath it seemed incredible that this pure harmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change meanwhile everything mattersthat concerns you he said she looked at him thoughtfully and turned back to the divan he sat down beside her and waited but suddenly he heard a step echoing far off down the empty rooms and felt the pressure of the minutes what is it you wanted to tell me she asked as if she had received the same warning what i wanted to tell you he rejoined why that i believe you came to new york because you were afraid afraid of my coming to washington she looked down at her muff and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily well wellyes she said you were afraid you knew yes i knew well then he insisted well then this is better isnt it she returned with a long questioning sigh better we shall hurt others less isnt it after all what you always wanted to have you here you meanin reach and yet out of reach to meet you in this way on the sly its the very reverse of what i want i told you the other day what i wanted she hesitated and you still think thisworse a thousand times he paused it would be easy to lie to you but the truth is i think it detestable oh so do i she cried with a deep breath of relief he sprang up impatiently well thenits my turn to ask what is it in gods name that you think better she hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her muff the step drew nearer and a guardian in a braided cap walked listlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis they fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them and when the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and sarcophagi archer spoke again what do you think better instead of answering she murmured i promised granny to stay with her because it seemed to me that here i should be safer from me she bent her head slightly without looking at him safer from loving me her profile did not stir but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and hang in a mesh of her veil safer from doing irreparable harm dont let us be like all the others she protested what others i dont profess to be different from my kind im consumed by the same wants and the same longings she glanced at him with a kind of terror and he saw a faint colour steal into her cheeks shall ionce come to you and then go home she suddenly hazarded in a low clear voice the blood rushed to the young mans forehead dearest he said without moving it seemed as if he held his heart in his hands like a full cup that the least motion might overbrim then her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded go home what do you mean by going home home to my husband and you expect me to say yes to that she raised her troubled eyes to his what else is there i cant stay here and lie to the people whove been good to me but thats the very reason why i ask you to come away and destroy their lives when theyve helped me to remake mine archer sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate despair it would have been easy to say yes come come once he knew the power she would put in his hands if she consented there would be no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband but something silenced the word on his lips a sort of passionate honesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her into that familiar trap if i were to let her come he said to himself i should have to let her go again and that was not to be imagined but he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek and wavered after all he began again we have lives of our own theres no use attempting the impossible youre so unprejudiced about some things so used as you say to looking at the gorgon that i dont know why youre afraid to face our case and see it as it really isunless you think the sacrifice is not worth making she stood up also her lips tightening under a rapid frown call it that theni must go she said drawing her little watch from her bosom she turned away and he followed and caught her by the wrist well then come to me once he said his head turning suddenly at the thought of losing her and for a second or two they looked at each other almost like enemies when he insisted tomorrow she hesitated the day after dearest he said again she had disengaged her wrist but for a moment they continued to hold each others eyes and he saw that her face which had grown very pale was flooded with a deep inner radiance his heart beat with awe he felt that he had never before beheld love visible oh i shall be lategoodbye no dont come any farther than this she cried walking hurriedly away down the long room as if the reflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her when she reached the door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell archer walked home alone darkness was falling when he let himself into his house and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall as if he viewed them from the other side of the grave the parlourmaid hearing his step ran up the stairs to light the gas on the upper landing is mrs archer in no sir mrs archer went out in the carriage after luncheon and hasnt come back with a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in his armchair the parlourmaid followed bringing the student lamp and shaking some coals onto the dying fire when she left he continued to sit motionless his elbows on his knees his chin on his clasped hands his eyes fixed on the red grate he sat there without conscious thoughts without sense of the lapse of time in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather than quicken it this was what had to be then this was what had to be he kept repeating to himself as if he hung in the clutch of doom what he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a mortal chill in his rapture the door opened and may came in im dreadfully lateyou werent worried were you she asked laying her hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses he looked up astonished is it late after seven i believe youve been asleep she laughed and drawing out her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa she looked paler than usual but sparkling with an unwonted animation i went to see granny and just as i was going away ellen came in from a walk so i stayed and had a long talk with her it was ages since wed had a real talk she had dropped into her usual armchair facing his and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair he fancied she expected him to speak a really good talk she went on smiling with what seemed to archer an unnatural vividness she was so dearjust like the old ellen im afraid i havent been fair to her lately ive sometimes thought archer stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece out of the radius of the lamp yes youve thought he echoed as she paused well perhaps i havent judged her fairly shes so differentat least on the surface she takes up such odd peopleshe seems to like to make herself conspicuous i suppose its the life shes led in that fast european society no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her but i dont want to judge her unfairly she paused again a little breathless with the unwonted length of her speech and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her cheeks archer as he looked at her was reminded of the glow which had suffused her face in the mission garden at st augustine he became aware of the same obscure effort in her the same reaching out toward something beyond the usual range of her vision she hates ellen he thought and shes trying to overcome the feeling and to get me to help her to overcome it the thought moved him and for a moment he was on the point of breaking the silence between them and throwing himself on her mercy you understand dont you she went on why the family have sometimes been annoyed we all did what we could for her at first but she never seemed to understand and now this idea of going to see mrs beaufort of going there in grannys carriage im afraid shes quite alienated the van der luydens ah said archer with an impatient laugh the open door had closed between them again its time to dress were dining out arent we he asked moving from the fire she rose also but lingered near the hearth as he walked past her she moved forward impulsively as though to detain him their eyes met and he saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her to drive to jersey city she flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his you havent kissed me today she said in a whisper and he felt her tremble in his arms at the court of the tuileries said mr sillerton jackson with his reminiscent smile such things were pretty openly tolerated the scene was the van der luydens black walnut diningroom in madison avenue and the time the evening after newland archers visit to the museum of art mr and mrs van der luyden had come to town for a few days from skuytercliff whither they had precipitately fled at the announcement of beauforts failure it had been represented to them that the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable affair made their presence in town more necessary than ever it was one of the occasions when as mrs archer put it they owed it to society to show themselves at the opera and even to open their own doors it will never do my dear louisa to let people like mrs lemuel struthers think they can step into reginas shoes it is just at such times that new people push in and get a footing it was owing to the epidemic of chickenpox in new york the winter mrs struthers first appeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their wives were in the nursery you and dear henry louisa must stand in the breach as you always have mr and mrs van der luyden could not remain deaf to such a call and reluctantly but heroically they had come to town unmuffled the house and sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception on this particular evening they had invited sillerton jackson mrs archer and newland and his wife to go with them to the opera where faust was being sung for the first time that winter nothing was done without ceremony under the van der luyden roof and though there were but four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually so that the proper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the gentlemen settled down to their cigars archer had not seen his wife since the evening before he had left early for the office where he had plunged into an accumulation of unimportant business in the afternoon one of the senior partners had made an unexpected call on his time and he had reached home so late that may had preceded him to the van der luydens and sent back the carriage now across the skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate she struck him as pale and languid but her eyes shone and she talked with exaggerated animation the subject which had called forth mr sillerton jacksons favourite allusion had been brought up archer fancied not without intention by their hostess the beaufort failure or rather the beaufort attitude since the failure was still a fruitful theme for the drawingroom moralist and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned mrs van der luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on may archer is it possible dear that what i hear is true i was told your grandmother mingotts carriage was seen standing at mrs beauforts door it was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady by her christian name mays colour rose and mrs archer put in hastily if it was im convinced it was there without mrs mingotts knowledge ah you think mrs van der luyden paused sighed and glanced at her husband im afraid mr van der luyden said that madame olenskas kind heart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on mrs beaufort or her taste for peculiar people put in mrs archer in a dry tone while her eyes dwelt innocently on her sons im sorry to think it of madame olenska said mrs van der luyden and mrs archer murmured ah my dearand after youd had her twice at skuytercliff it was at this point that mr jackson seized the chance to place his favourite allusion at the tuileries he repeated seeing the eyes of the company expectantly turned on him the standard was excessively lax in some respects and if youd asked where mornys money came from or who paid the debts of some of the court beauties i hope dear sillerton said mrs archer you are not suggesting that we should adopt such standards i never suggest returned mr jackson imperturbably but madame olenskas foreign bringingup may make her less particular ah the two elder ladies sighed still to have kept her grandmothers carriage at a defaulters door mr van der luyden protested and archer guessed that he was remembering and resenting the hampers of carnations he had sent to the little house in twentythird street of course ive always said that she looks at things quite differently mrs archer summed up a flush rose to mays forehead she looked across the table at her husband and said precipitately im sure ellen meant it kindly imprudent people are often kind said mrs archer as if the fact were scarcely an extenuation and mrs van der luyden murmured if only she had consulted some one ah that she never did mrs archer rejoined at this point mr van der luyden glanced at his wife who bent her head slightly in the direction of mrs archer and the glimmering trains of the three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down to their cigars mr van der luyden supplied short ones on opera nights but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his inexorable punctuality archer after the first act had detached himself from the party and made his way to the back of the club box from there he watched over various chivers mingott and rushworth shoulders the same scene that he had looked at two years previously on the night of his first meeting with ellen olenska he had halfexpected her to appear again in old mrs mingotts box but it remained empty and he sat motionless his eyes fastened on it till suddenly madame nilssons pure soprano broke out into mama non mama archer turned to the stage where in the familiar setting of giant roses and penwiper pansies the same large blonde victim was succumbing to the same small brown seducer from the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where may sat between two older ladies just as on that former evening she had sat between mrs lovell mingott and her newlyarrived foreign cousin as on that evening she was all in white and archer who had not noticed what she wore recognised the bluewhite satin and old lace of her wedding dress it was the custom in old new york for brides to appear in this costly garment during the first year or two of marriage his mother he knew kept hers in tissue paper in the hope that janey might some day wear it though poor janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and no bridesmaids would be thought more appropriate it struck archer that may since their return from europe had seldom worn her bridal satin and the surprise of seeing her in it made him compare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with such blissful anticipations two years earlier though mays outline was slightly heavier as her goddesslike build had foretold her athletic erectness of carriage and the girlish transparency of her expression remained unchanged but for the slight languor that archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the exact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of liliesofthevalley on her betrothal evening the fact seemed an additional appeal to his pity such innocence was as moving as the trustful clasp of a child then he remembered the passionate generosity latent under that incurious calm he recalled her glance of understanding when he had urged that their engagement should be announced at the beaufort ball he heard the voice in which she had said in the mission garden i couldnt have my happiness made out of a wronga wrong to some one else and an uncontrollable longing seized him to tell her the truth to throw himself on her generosity and ask for the freedom he had once refused newland archer was a quiet and selfcontrolled young man conformity to the discipline of a small society had become almost his second nature it was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic and conspicuous anything mr van der luyden would have deprecated and the club box condemned as bad form but he had become suddenly unconscious of the club box of mr van der luyden of all that had so long enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit he walked along the semicircular passage at the back of the house and opened the door of mrs van der luydens box as if it had been a gate into the unknown mama thrilled out the triumphant marguerite and the occupants of the box looked up in surprise at archers entrance he had already broken one of the rules of his world which forbade the entering of a box during a solo slipping between mr van der luyden and sillerton jackson he leaned over his wife ive got a beastly headache dont tell any one but come home wont you he whispered may gave him a glance of comprehension and he saw her whisper to his mother who nodded sympathetically then she murmured an excuse to mrs van der luyden and rose from her seat just as marguerite fell into fausts arms archer while he helped her on with her opera cloak noticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies as they drove away may laid her hand shyly on his im so sorry you dont feel well im afraid theyve been overworking you again at the office noits not that do you mind if i open the window he returned confusedly letting down the pane on his side he sat staring out into the street feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful interrogation and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing houses at their door she caught her skirt in the step of the carriage and fell against him did you hurt yourself he asked steadying her with his arm no but my poor dresssee how ive torn it she exclaimed she bent to gather up a mudstained breadth and followed him up the steps into the hall the servants had not expected them so early and there was only a glimmer of gas on the upper landing archer mounted the stairs turned up the light and put a match to the brackets on each side of the library mantelpiece the curtains were drawn and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of a familiar face met during an unavowable errand he noticed that his wife was very pale and asked if he should get her some brandy oh no she exclaimed with a momentary flush as she took off her cloak but hadnt you better go to bed at once she added as he opened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette archer threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the fire no my head is not as bad as that he paused and theres something i want to say something importantthat i must tell you at once she had dropped into an armchair and raised her head as he spoke yes dear she rejoined so gently that he wondered at the lack of wonder with which she received this preamble may he began standing a few feet from her chair and looking over at her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable abyss the sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike hush and he repeated there is something ive got to tell you about myself she sat silent without a movement or a tremor of her lashes she was still extremely pale but her face had a curious tranquillity of expression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source archer checked the conventional phrases of selfaccusal that were crowding to his lips he was determined to put the case baldly without vain recrimination or excuse madame olenska he said but at the name his wife raised her hand as if to silence him as she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of her weddingring oh why should we talk about ellen tonight she asked with a slight pout of impatience because i ought to have spoken before her face remained calm is it really worth while dear i know ive been unfair to her at timesperhaps we all have youve understood her no doubt better than we did youve always been kind to her but what does it matter now its all over archer looked at her blankly could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife all overwhat do you mean he asked in an indistinct stammer may still looked at him with transparent eyes whysince shes going back to europe so soon since granny approves and understands and has arranged to make her independent of her husband she broke off and archer grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in one convulsed hand and steadying himself against it made a vain effort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts i supposed he heard his wifes even voice go on that you had been kept at the office this evening about the business arrangements it was settled this morning i believe she lowered her eyes under his unseeing stare and another fugitive flush passed over her face he understood that his own eyes must be unbearable and turning away rested his elbows on the mantelshelf and covered his face something drummed and clanged furiously in his ears he could not tell if it were the blood in his veins or the tick of the clock on the mantel may sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out five minutes a lump of coal fell forward in the grate and hearing her rise to push it back archer at length turned and faced her its impossible he exclaimed impossible how do you knowwhat youve just told me i saw ellen yesterdayi told you id seen her at grannys it wasnt then that she told you no i had a note from her this afternoondo you want to see it he could not find his voice and she went out of the room and came back almost immediately i thought you knew she said simply she laid a sheet of paper on the table and archer put out his hand and took it up the letter contained only a few lines may dear i have at last made granny understand that my visit to her could be no more than a visit and she has been as kind and generous as ever she sees now that if i return to europe i must live by myself or rather with poor aunt medora who is coming with me i am hurrying back to washington to pack up and we sail next week you must be very good to granny when im goneas good as youve always been to me ellen if any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind please tell them it would be utterly useless archer read the letter over two or three times then he flung it down and burst out laughing the sound of his laugh startled him it recalled janeys midnight fright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over mays telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been advanced why did she write this he asked checking his laugh with a supreme effort may met the question with her unshaken candour i suppose because we talked things over yesterday what things i told her i was afraid i hadnt been fair to herhadnt always understood how hard it must have been for her here alone among so many people who were relations and yet strangers who felt the right to criticise and yet didnt always know the circumstances she paused i knew youd been the one friend she could always count on and i wanted her to know that you and i were the samein all our feelings she hesitated as if waiting for him to speak and then added slowly she understood my wishing to tell her this i think she understands everything she went up to archer and taking one of his cold hands pressed it quickly against her cheek my head aches too goodnight dear she said and turned to the door her torn and muddy weddingdress dragging after her across the room it was as mrs archer smilingly said to mrs welland a great event for a young couple to give their first big dinner the newland archers since they had set up their household had received a good deal of company in an informal way archer was fond of having three or four friends to dine and may welcomed them with the beaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in conjugal affairs her husband questioned whether if left to herself she would ever have asked any one to the house but he had long given up trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which tradition and training had moulded her it was expected that welloff young couples in new york should do a good deal of informal entertaining and a welland married to an archer was doubly pledged to the tradition but a big dinner with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen with roman punch roses from hendersons and menus on giltedged cards was a different affair and not to be lightly undertaken as mrs archer remarked the roman punch made all the difference not in itself but by its manifold implicationssince it signified either canvasbacks or terrapin two soups a hot and a cold sweet full decolletage with short sleeves and guests of a proportionate importance it was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their first invitations in the third person and their summons was seldom refused even by the seasoned and soughtafter still it was admittedly a triumph that the van der luydens at mays request should have stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the countess olenska the two mothersinlaw sat in mays drawingroom on the afternoon of the great day mrs archer writing out the menus on tiffanys thickest giltedged bristol while mrs welland superintended the placing of the palms and standard lamps archer arriving late from his office found them still there mrs archer had turned her attention to the namecards for the table and mrs welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large gilt sofa so that another corner might be created between the piano and the window may they told him was in the diningroom inspecting the mound of jacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table and the placing of the maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between the candelabra on the piano stood a large basket of orchids which mr van der luyden had had sent from skuytercliff everything was in short as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event mrs archer ran thoughtfully over the list checking off each name with her sharp gold pen henry van der luydenlouisathe lovell mingottsthe reggie chiverseslawrence lefferts and gertrudeyes i suppose may was right to have themthe selfridge merrys sillerton jackson van newland and his wife how time passes it seems only yesterday that he was your best man newlandand countess olenskayes i think thats all mrs welland surveyed her soninlaw affectionately no one can say newland that you and may are not giving ellen a handsome sendoff ah well said mrs archer i understand mays wanting her cousin to tell people abroad that were not quite barbarians im sure ellen will appreciate it she was to arrive this morning i believe it will make a most charming last impression the evening before sailing is usually so dreary mrs welland cheerfully continued archer turned toward the door and his motherinlaw called to him do go in and have a peep at the table and dont let may tire herself too much but he affected not to hear and sprang up the stairs to his library the room looked at him like an alien countenance composed into a polite grimace and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly tidied and prepared by a judicious distribution of ashtrays and cedarwood boxes for the gentlemen to smoke in ah well he thought its not for long and he went on to his dressingroom ten days had passed since madame olenskas departure from new york during those ten days archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed by the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper and sent to his office in a sealed envelope addressed in her hand this retort to his last appeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar game but the young man chose to give it a different meaning she was still fighting against her fate but she was going to europe and she was not returning to her husband nothing therefore was to prevent his following her and once he had taken the irrevocable step and had proved to her that it was irrevocable he believed she would not send him away this confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the present it had kept him from writing to her or betraying by any sign or act his misery and mortification it seemed to him that in the deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands and he waited there had been nevertheless moments sufficiently difficult to pass as when mr letterblair the day after madame olenskas departure had sent for him to go over the details of the trust which mrs manson mingott wished to create for her granddaughter for a couple of hours archer had examined the terms of the deed with his senior all the while obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some reason other than the obvious one of his cousinship and that the close of the conference would reveal it well the lady cant deny that its a handsome arrangement mr letterblair had summed up after mumbling over a summary of the settlement in fact im bound to say shes been treated pretty handsomely all round all round archer echoed with a touch of derision do you refer to her husbands proposal to give her back her own money mr letterblairs bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch my dear sir the laws the law and your wifes cousin was married under the french law its to be presumed she knew what that meant even if she did what happened subsequently but archer paused mr letterblair had laid his penhandle against his big corrugated nose and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous elderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that virtue is not synonymous with ignorance my dear sir ive no wish to extenuate the counts transgressions butbut on the other side i wouldnt put my hand in the fire well that there hadnt been tit for tat with the young champion mr letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded paper toward archer this report the result of discreet enquiries and then as archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to repudiate the suggestion the lawyer somewhat flatly continued i dont say its conclusive you observe far from it but straws show and on the whole its eminently satisfactory for all parties that this dignified solution has been reached oh eminently archer assented pushing back the paper a day or two later on responding to a summons from mrs manson mingott his soul had been more deeply tried he had found the old lady depressed and querulous you know shes deserted me she began at once and without waiting for his reply oh dont ask me why she gave so many reasons that ive forgotten them all my private belief is that she couldnt face the boredom at any rate thats what augusta and my daughtersinlaw think and i dont know that i altogether blame her olenskis a finished scoundrel but life with him must have been a good deal gayer than it is in fifth avenue not that the family would admit that they think fifth avenue is heaven with the rue de la paix thrown in and poor ellen of course has no idea of going back to her husband she held out as firmly as ever against that so shes to settle down in paris with that fool medora well paris is paris and you can keep a carriage there on next to nothing but she was as gay as a bird and i shall miss her two tears the parched tears of the old rolled down her puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom all i ask is she concluded that they shouldnt bother me any more i must really be allowed to digest my gruel and she twinkled a little wistfully at archer it was that evening on his return home that may announced her intention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin madame olenskas name had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight to washington and archer looked at his wife with surprise a dinnerwhy he interrogated her colour rose but you like elleni thought youd be pleased its awfully niceyour putting it in that way but i really dont see i mean to do it newland she said quietly rising and going to her desk here are the invitations all written mother helped meshe agrees that we ought to she paused embarrassed and yet smiling and archer suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the family oh all right he said staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand when he entered the drawingroom before dinner may was stooping over the fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed setting of immaculate tiles the tall lamps were all lit and mr van der luydens orchids had been conspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and knobby silver mrs newland archers drawingroom was generally thought a great success a gilt bamboo jardiniere in which the primulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed blocked the access to the bay window where the oldfashioned would have preferred a bronze reduction of the venus of milo the sofas and armchairs of pale brocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered with silver toys porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames and tall rosyshaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the palms i dont think ellen has ever seen this room lighted up said may rising flushed from her struggle and sending about her a glance of pardonable pride the brass tongs which she had propped against the side of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husbands answer and before he could restore them mr and mrs van der luyden were announced the other guests quickly followed for it was known that the van der luydens liked to dine punctually the room was nearly full and archer was engaged in showing to mrs selfridge merry a small highlyvarnished verbeckhoven study of sheep which mr welland had given may for christmas when he found madame olenska at his side she was excessively pale and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser and heavier than ever perhaps that or the fact that she had wound several rows of amber beads about her neck reminded him suddenly of the little ellen mingott he had danced with at childrens parties when medora manson had first brought her to new york the amber beads were trying to her complexion or her dress was perhaps unbecoming her face looked lustreless and almost ugly and he had never loved it as he did at that minute their hands met and he thought he heard her say yes were sailing tomorrow in the russia then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors and after an interval mays voice newland dinners been announced wont you please take ellen in madame olenska put her hand on his arm and he noticed that the hand was ungloved and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the evening that he had sat with her in the little twentythird street drawingroom all the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have taken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on his sleeve and he said to himself if it were only to see her hand again i should have to follow her it was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a foreign visitor that mrs van der luyden could suffer the diminution of being placed on her hosts left the fact of madame olenskas foreignness could hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell tribute and mrs van der luyden accepted her displacement with an affability which left no doubt as to her approval there were certain things that had to be done and if done at all done handsomely and thoroughly and one of these in the old new york code was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe there was nothing on earth that the wellands and mingotts would not have done to proclaim their unalterable affection for the countess olenska now that her passage for europe was engaged and archer at the head of his table sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her popularity had been retrieved grievances against her silenced her past countenanced and her present irradiated by the family approval mrs van der luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her nearest approach to cordiality and mr van der luyden from his seat at mays right cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify all the carnations he had sent from skuytercliff archer who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd imponderability as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and ceiling wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the proceedings as his glance travelled from one placid wellfed face to another he saw all the harmlesslooking people engaged upon mays canvasbacks as a band of dumb conspirators and himself and the pale woman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy and then it came over him in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams that to all of them he and madame olenska were lovers lovers in the extreme sense peculiar to foreign vocabularies he guessed himself to have been for months the centre of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears he understood that by means as yet unknown to him the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything or had ever imagined anything and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply may archers natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and cousin it was the old new york way of taking life without effusion of blood the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease who placed decency above courage and who considered that nothing was more illbred than scenes except the behaviour of those who gave rise to them as these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind archer felt like a prisoner in the centre of an armed camp he looked about the table and guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in which over the asparagus from florida they were dealing with beaufort and his wife its to show me he thought what would happen to me and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy over direct action and of silence over rash words closed in on him like the doors of the family vault he laughed and met mrs van der luydens startled eyes you think it laughable she said with a pinched smile of course poor reginas idea of remaining in new york has its ridiculous side i suppose and archer muttered of course at this point he became conscious that madame olenskas other neighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right at the same moment he saw that may serenely enthroned between mr van der luyden and mr selfridge merry had cast a quick glance down the table it was evident that the host and the lady on his right could not sit through the whole meal in silence he turned to madame olenska and her pale smile met him oh do lets see it through it seemed to say did you find the journey tiring he asked in a voice that surprised him by its naturalness and she answered that on the contrary she had seldom travelled with fewer discomforts except you know the dreadful heat in the train she added and he remarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the country she was going to i never he declared with intensity was more nearly frozen than once in april in the train between calais and paris she said she did not wonder but remarked that after all one could always carry an extra rug and that every form of travel had its hardships to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no account compared with the blessedness of getting away she changed colour and he added his voice suddenly rising in pitch i mean to do a lot of travelling myself before long a tremor crossed her face and leaning over to reggie chivers he cried out i say reggie what do you say to a trip round the world now next month i mean im game if you are at which mrs reggie piped up that she could not think of letting reggie go till after the martha washington ball she was getting up for the blind asylum in easter week and her husband placidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for the international polo match but mr selfridge merry had caught the phrase round the world and having once circled the globe in his steamyacht he seized the opportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning the shallowness of the mediterranean ports though after all he added it didnt matter for when youd seen athens and smyrna and constantinople what else was there and mrs merry said she could never be too grateful to dr bencomb for having made them promise not to go to naples on account of the fever but you must have three weeks to do india properly her husband conceded anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous globetrotter and at this point the ladies went up to the drawingroom in the library in spite of weightier presences lawrence lefferts predominated the talk as usual had veered around to the beauforts and even mr van der luyden and mr selfridge merry installed in the honorary armchairs tacitly reserved for them paused to listen to the younger mans philippic never had lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn christian manhood and exalt the sanctity of the home indignation lent him a scathing eloquence and it was clear that if others had followed his example and acted as he talked society would never have been weak enough to receive a foreign upstart like beaufortno sir not even if hed married a van der luyden or a lanning instead of a dallas and what chance would there have been lefferts wrathfully questioned of his marrying into such a family as the dallases if he had not already wormed his way into certain houses as people like mrs lemuel struthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake if society chose to open its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great though the gain was doubtful but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure origin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegrationand at no distant date if things go on at this pace lefferts thundered looking like a young prophet dressed by poole and who had not yet been stoned we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers houses and marrying beauforts bastards oh i saydraw it mild reggie chivers and young newland protested while mr selfridge merry looked genuinely alarmed and an expression of pain and disgust settled on mr van der luydens sensitive face has he got any cried mr sillerton jackson pricking up his ears and while lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh the old gentleman twittered into archers ear queer those fellows who are always wanting to set things right the people who have the worst cooks are always telling you theyre poisoned when they dine out but i hear there are pressing reasons for our friend lawrences diatribetypewriter this time i understand the talk swept past archer like some senseless river running and running because it did not know enough to stop he saw on the faces about him expressions of interest amusement and even mirth he listened to the younger mens laughter and to the praise of the archer madeira which mr van der luyden and mr merry were thoughtfully celebrating through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude of friendliness toward himself as if the guard of the prisoner he felt himself to be were trying to soften his captivity and the perception increased his passionate determination to be free in the drawingroom where they presently joined the ladies he met mays triumphant eyes and read in them the conviction that everything had gone off beautifully she rose from madame olenskas side and immediately mrs van der luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the gilt sofa where she throned mrs selfridge merry bore across the room to join them and it became clear to archer that here also a conspiracy of rehabilitation and obliteration was going on the silent organisation which held his little world together was determined to put itself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety of madame olenskas conduct or the completeness of archers domestic felicity all these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely engaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of suspected or even conceived possible the least hint to the contrary and from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation archer once more disengaged the fact that new york believed him to be madame olenskas lover he caught the glitter of victory in his wifes eyes and for the first time understood that she shared the belief the discovery roused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his efforts to discuss the martha washington ball with mrs reggie chivers and little mrs newland and so the evening swept on running and running like a senseless river that did not know how to stop at length he saw that madame olenska had risen and was saying goodbye he understood that in a moment she would be gone and tried to remember what he had said to her at dinner but he could not recall a single word they had exchanged she went up to may the rest of the company making a circle about her as she advanced the two young women clasped hands then may bent forward and kissed her cousin certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two archer heard reggie chivers say in an undertone to young mrs newland and he remembered beauforts coarse sneer at mays ineffectual beauty a moment later he was in the hall putting madame olenskas cloak about her shoulders through all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to say nothing that might startle or disturb her convinced that no power could now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events shape themselves as they would but as he followed madame olenska into the hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone with her at the door of her carriage is your carriage here he asked and at that moment mrs van der luyden who was being majestically inserted into her sables said gently we are driving dear ellen home archers heart gave a jerk and madame olenska clasping her cloak and fan with one hand held out the other to him goodbye she said goodbyebut i shall see you soon in paris he answered aloudit seemed to him that he had shouted it oh she murmured if you and may could come mr van der luyden advanced to give her his arm and archer turned to mrs van der luyden for a moment in the billowy darkness inside the big landau he caught the dim oval of a face eyes shining steadilyand she was gone as he went up the steps he crossed lawrence lefferts coming down with his wife lefferts caught his host by the sleeve drawing back to let gertrude pass i say old chap do you mind just letting it be understood that im dining with you at the club tomorrow night thanks so much you old brick goodnight it did go off beautifully didnt it may questioned from the threshold of the library archer roused himself with a start as soon as the last carriage had driven away he had come up to the library and shut himself in with the hope that his wife who still lingered below would go straight to her room but there she stood pale and drawn yet radiating the factitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue may i come and talk it over she asked of course if you like but you must be awfully sleepy no im not sleepy i should like to sit with you a little very well he said pushing her chair near the fire she sat down and he resumed his seat but neither spoke for a long time at length archer began abruptly since youre not tired and want to talk theres something i must tell you i tried to the other night she looked at him quickly yes dear something about yourself about myself you say youre not tired well i am horribly tired in an instant she was all tender anxiety oh ive seen it coming on newland youve been so wickedly overworked perhaps its that anyhow i want to make a break a break to give up the law to go away at any rateat once on a long trip ever so far offaway from everything he paused conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with the indifference of a man who longs for a change and is yet too weary to welcome it do what he would the chord of eagerness vibrated away from everything he repeated ever so far where for instance she asked oh i dont know indiaor japan she stood up and as he sat with bent head his chin propped on his hands he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him as far as that but im afraid you cant dear she said in an unsteady voice not unless youll take me with you and then as he was silent she went on in tones so clear and evenlypitched that each separate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain that is if the doctors will let me go but im afraid they wont for you see newland ive been sure since this morning of something ive been so longing and hoping for he looked up at her with a sick stare and she sank down all dew and roses and hid her face against his knee oh my dear he said holding her to him while his cold hand stroked her hair there was a long pause which the inner devils filled with strident laughter then may freed herself from his arms and stood up you didnt guess yesi no that is of course i hoped they looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent then turning his eyes from hers he asked abruptly have you told any one else only mamma and your mother she paused and then added hurriedly the blood flushing up to her forehead that isand ellen you know i told you wed had a long talk one afternoonand how dear she was to me ah said archer his heart stopping he felt that his wife was watching him intently did you mind my telling her first newland mind why should i he made a last effort to collect himself but that was a fortnight ago wasnt it i thought you said you werent sure till today her colour burned deeper but she held his gaze no i wasnt sure thenbut i told her i was and you see i was right she exclaimed her blue eyes wet with victory newland archer sat at the writingtable in his library in east thirtyninth street he had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration of the new galleries at the metropolitan museum and the spectacle of those great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages where the throng of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically catalogued treasures had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory why this used to be one of the old cesnola rooms he heard some one say and instantly everything about him vanished and he was sitting alone on a hard leather divan against a radiator while a slight figure in a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrelyfitted vista of the old museum the vision had roused a host of other associations and he sat looking with new eyes at the library which for over thirty years had been the scene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations it was the room in which most of the real things of his life had happened there his wife nearly twentysix years ago had broken to him with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young women of the new generation to smile the news that she was to have a child and there their eldest boy dallas too delicate to be taken to church in midwinter had been christened by their old friend the bishop of new york the ample magnificent irreplaceable bishop so long the pride and ornament of his diocese there dallas had first staggered across the floor shouting dad while may and the nurse laughed behind the door there their second child mary who was so like her mother had announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of reggie chiverss many sons and there archer had kissed her through her wedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them to grace churchfor in a world where all else had reeled on its foundations the grace church wedding remained an unchanged institution it was in the library that he and may had always discussed the future of the children the studies of dallas and his young brother bill marys incurable indifference to accomplishments and passion for sport and philanthropy and the vague leanings toward art which had finally landed the restless and curious dallas in the office of a rising new york architect the young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and business and taking up all sorts of new things if they were not absorbed in state politics or municipal reform the chances were that they were going in for central american archaeology for architecture or landscapeengineering taking a keen and learned interest in the prerevolutionary buildings of their own country studying and adapting georgian types and protesting at the meaningless use of the word colonial nobody nowadays had colonial houses except the millionaire grocers of the suburbs but above allsometimes archer put it above allit was in that library that the governor of new york coming down from albany one evening to dine and spend the night had turned to his host and said banging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eyeglasses hang the professional politician youre the kind of man the country wants archer if the stables ever to be cleaned out men like you have got to lend a hand in the cleaning men like you how archer had glowed at the phrase how eagerly he had risen up at the call it was an echo of ned winsetts old appeal to roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck but spoken by a man who set the example of the gesture and whose summons to follow him was irresistible archer as he looked back was not sure that men like himself were what his country needed at least in the active service to which theodore roosevelt had pointed in fact there was reason to think it did not for after a year in the state assembly he had not been reelected and had dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work and from that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the reforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its apathy it was little enough to look back on but when he remembered to what the young men of his generation and his set had looked forwardthe narrow groove of moneymaking sport and society to which their vision had been limitedeven his small contribution to the new state of things seemed to count as each brick counts in a wellbuilt wall he had done little in public life he would always be by nature a contemplative and a dilettante but he had had high things to contemplate great things to delight in and one great mans friendship to be his strength and pride he had been in short what people were beginning to call a good citizen in new york for many years past every new movement philanthropic municipal or artistic had taken account of his opinion and wanted his name people said ask archer when there was a question of starting the first school for crippled children reorganising the museum of art founding the grolier club inaugurating the new library or getting up a new society of chamber music his days were full and they were filled decently he supposed it was all a man ought to ask something he knew he had missed the flower of life but he thought of it now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined would have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first prize in a lottery there were a hundred million tickets in his lottery and there was only one prize the chances had been too decidedly against him when he thought of ellen olenska it was abstractly serenely as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed that vision faint and tenuous as it was had kept him from thinking of other women he had been what was called a faithful husband and when may had suddenly diedcarried off by the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest childhe had honestly mourned her their long years together had shown him that it did not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty as long as it kept the dignity of a duty lapsing from that it became a mere battle of ugly appetites looking about him he honoured his own past and mourned for it after all there was good in the old ways his eyes making the round of the roomdone over by dallas with english mezzotints chippendale cabinets bits of chosen blueandwhite and pleasantly shaded electric lampscame back to the old eastlake writingtable that he had never been willing to banish and to his first photograph of may which still kept its place beside his inkstand there she was tall roundbosomed and willowy in her starched muslin and flapping leghorn as he had seen her under the orangetrees in the mission garden and as he had seen her that day so she had remained never quite at the same height yet never far below it generous faithful unwearied but so lacking in imagination so incapable of growth that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change this hard bright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered her incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their views from her as archer concealed his there had been from the first a joint pretence of sameness a kind of innocent family hypocrisy in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated and she had died thinking the world a good place full of loving and harmonious households like her own and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that whatever happened newland would continue to inculcate in dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents lives and that dallas in turn when newland followed her would transmit the sacred trust to little bill and of mary she was sure as of her own self so having snatched little bill from the grave and given her life in the effort she went contentedly to her place in the archer vault in st marks where mrs archer already lay safe from the terrifying trend which her daughterinlaw had never even become aware of opposite mays portrait stood one of her daughter mary chivers was as tall and fair as her mother but largewaisted flatchested and slightly slouching as the altered fashion required mary chiverss mighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the twentyinch waist that may archers azure sash so easily spanned and the difference seemed symbolic the mothers life had been as closely girt as her figure mary who was no less conventional and no more intelligent yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views there was good in the new order too the telephone clicked and archer turning from the photographs unhooked the transmitter at his elbow how far they were from the days when the legs of the brassbuttoned messenger boy had been new yorks only means of quick communication chicago wants you ahit must be a longdistance from dallas who had been sent to chicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the lakeside palace they were to build for a young millionaire with ideas the firm always sent dallas on such errands hallo dadyes dallas i sayhow do you feel about sailing on wednesday mauretania yes next wednesday as ever is our client wants me to look at some italian gardens before we settle anything and has asked me to nip over on the next boat ive got to be back on the first of june the voice broke into a joyful conscious laughso we must look alive i say dad i want your help do come dallas seemed to be speaking in the room the voice was as near by and natural as if he had been lounging in his favourite armchair by the fire the fact would not ordinarily have surprised archer for longdistance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as electric lighting and fiveday atlantic voyages but the laugh did startle him it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and miles of countryforest river mountain prairie roaring cities and busy indifferent millionsdallass laugh should be able to say of course whatever happens i must get back on the first because fanny beaufort and i are to be married on the fifth the voice began again think it over no sir not a minute youve got to say yes now why not id like to know if you can allege a single reasonno i knew it then its a go eh because i count on you to ring up the cunard office first thing tomorrow and youd better book a return on a boat from marseilles i say dad itll be our last time together in this kind of way oh good i knew you would chicago rang off and archer rose and began to pace up and down the room it would be their last time together in this kind of way the boy was right they would have lots of other times after dallass marriage his father was sure for the two were born comrades and fanny beaufort whatever one might think of her did not seem likely to interfere with their intimacy on the contrary from what he had seen of her he thought she would be naturally included in it still change was change and differences were differences and much as he felt himself drawn toward his future daughterinlaw it was tempting to seize this last chance of being alone with his boy there was no reason why he should not seize it except the profound one that he had lost the habit of travel may had disliked to move except for valid reasons such as taking the children to the sea or in the mountains she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in thirtyninth street or their comfortable quarters at the wellands in newport after dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty to travel for six months and the whole family had made the oldfashioned tour through england switzerland and italy their time being limited no one knew why they had omitted france archer remembered dallass wrath at being asked to contemplate mont blanc instead of rheims and chartres but mary and bill wanted mountainclimbing and had already yawned their way in dallass wake through the english cathedrals and may always fair to her children had insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and artistic proclivities she had indeed proposed that her husband should go to paris for a fortnight and join them on the italian lakes after they had done switzerland but archer had declined well stick together he said and mays face had brightened at his setting such a good example to dallas since her death nearly two years before there had been no reason for his continuing in the same routine his children had urged him to travel mary chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad and see the galleries the very mysteriousness of such a cure made her the more confident of its efficacy but archer had found himself held fast by habit by memories by a sudden startled shrinking from new things now as he reviewed his past he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk the worst of doing ones duty was that it apparently unfitted one for doing anything else at least that was the view that the men of his generation had taken the trenchant divisions between right and wrong honest and dishonest respectable and the reverse had left so little scope for the unforeseen there are moments when a mans imagination so easily subdued to what it lives in suddenly rises above its daily level and surveys the long windings of destiny archer hung there and wondered what was left of the little world he had grown up in and whose standards had bent and bound him he remembered a sneering prophecy of poor lawrence leffertss uttered years ago in that very room if things go on at this rate our children will be marrying beauforts bastards it was just what archers eldest son the pride of his life was doing and nobody wondered or reproved even the boys aunt janey who still looked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth had taken her mothers emeralds and seedpearls out of their pink cottonwool and carried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride and fanny beaufort instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a set from a paris jeweller had exclaimed at their oldfashioned beauty and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an isabey miniature fanny beaufort who had appeared in new york at eighteen after the death of her parents had won its heart much as madame olenska had won it thirty years earlier only instead of being distrustful and afraid of her society took her joyfully for granted she was pretty amusing and accomplished what more did any one want nobody was narrowminded enough to rake up against her the halfforgotten facts of her fathers past and her own origin only the older people remembered so obscure an incident in the business life of new york as beauforts failure or the fact that after his wifes death he had been quietly married to the notorious fanny ring and had left the country with his new wife and a little girl who inherited her beauty he was subsequently heard of in constantinople then in russia and a dozen years later american travellers were handsomely entertained by him in buenos ayres where he represented a large insurance agency he and his wife died there in the odour of prosperity and one day their orphaned daughter had appeared in new york in charge of may archers sisterinlaw mrs jack welland whose husband had been appointed the girls guardian the fact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with newland archers children and nobody was surprised when dallass engagement was announced nothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the world had travelled people nowadays were too busybusy with reforms and movements with fads and fetishes and frivolitiesto bother much about their neighbours and of what account was anybodys past in the huge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same plane newland archer looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety of the paris streets felt his heart beating with the confusion and eagerness of youth it was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening waistcoat leaving him the next minute with an empty breast and hot temples he wondered if it was thus that his sons conducted itself in the presence of miss fanny beaufortand decided that it was not it functions as actively no doubt but the rhythm is different he reflected recalling the cool composure with which the young man had announced his engagement and taken for granted that his family would approve the difference is that these young people take it for granted that theyre going to get whatever they want and that we almost always took it for granted that we shouldnt only i wonderthe thing ones so certain of in advance can it ever make ones heart beat as wildly it was the day after their arrival in paris and the spring sunshine held archer in his open window above the wide silvery prospect of the place vendome one of the things he had stipulatedalmost the only onewhen he had agreed to come abroad with dallas was that in paris he shouldnt be made to go to one of the newfangled palaces oh all rightof course dallas goodnaturedly agreed ill take you to some jolly oldfashioned placethe bristol say leaving his father speechless at hearing that the centurylong home of kings and emperors was now spoken of as an oldfashioned inn where one went for its quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour archer had pictured often enough in the first impatient years the scene of his return to paris then the personal vision had faded and he had simply tried to see the city as the setting of madame olenskas life sitting alone at night in his library after the household had gone to bed he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the avenues of horsechestnuts the flowers and statues in the public gardens the whiff of lilacs from the flowercarts the majestic roll of the river under the great bridges and the life of art and study and pleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting now the spectacle was before him in its glory and as he looked out on it he felt shy oldfashioned inadequate a mere grey speck of a man compared with the ruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being dallass hand came down cheerily on his shoulder hullo father this is something like isnt it they stood for a while looking out in silence and then the young man continued by the way ive got a message for you the countess olenska expects us both at halfpast five he said it lightly carelessly as he might have imparted any casual item of information such as the hour at which their train was to leave for florence the next evening archer looked at him and thought he saw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his greatgrandmother mingotts malice oh didnt i tell you dallas pursued fanny made me swear to do three things while i was in paris get her the score of the last debussy songs go to the grandguignol and see madame olenska you know she was awfully good to fanny when mr beaufort sent her over from buenos ayres to the assomption fanny hadnt any friends in paris and madame olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays i believe she was a great friend of the first mrs beauforts and shes our cousin of course so i rang her up this morning before i went out and told her you and i were here for two days and wanted to see her archer continued to stare at him you told her i was here of coursewhy not dallass eye brows went up whimsically then getting no answer he slipped his arm through his fathers with a confidential pressure i say father what was she like archer felt his colour rise under his sons unabashed gaze come own up you and she were great pals werent you wasnt she most awfully lovely lovely i dont know she was different ahthere you have it thats what it always comes to doesnt it when she comes shes differentand one doesnt know why its exactly what i feel about fanny his father drew back a step releasing his arm about fanny but my dear fellowi should hope so only i dont see dash it dad dont be prehistoric wasnt sheonceyour fanny dallas belonged body and soul to the new generation he was the firstborn of newland and may archer yet it had never been possible to inculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve whats the use of making mysteries it only makes people want to nose em out he always objected when enjoined to discretion but archer meeting his eyes saw the filial light under their banter my fanny well the woman youd have chucked everything for only you didnt continued his surprising son i didnt echoed archer with a kind of solemnity no you date you see dear old boy but mother said your mother yes the day before she died it was when she sent for me aloneyou remember she said she knew we were safe with you and always would be because once when she asked you to youd given up the thing you most wanted archer received this strange communication in silence his eyes remained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the window at length he said in a low voice she never asked me no i forgot you never did ask each other anything did you and you never told each other anything you just sat and watched each other and guessed at what was going on underneath a deafanddumb asylum in fact well i back your generation for knowing more about each others private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about our owni say dad dallas broke off youre not angry with me if you are lets make it up and go and lunch at henris ive got to rush out to versailles afterward archer did not accompany his son to versailles he preferred to spend the afternoon in solitary roamings through paris he had to deal all at once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate lifetime after a little while he did not regret dallass indiscretion it seemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that after all some one had guessed and pitied and that it should have been his wife moved him indescribably dallas for all his affectionate insight would not have understood that to the boy no doubt the episode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration of wasted forces but was it really no more for a long time archer sat on a bench in the champs elysees and wondered while the stream of life rolled by a few streets away a few hours away ellen olenska waited she had never gone back to her husband and when he had died some years before she had made no change in her way of living there was nothing now to keep her and archer apartand that afternoon he was to see her he got up and walked across the place de la concorde and the tuileries gardens to the louvre she had once told him that she often went there and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place where he could think of her as perhaps having lately been for an hour or more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of afternoon light and one by one the pictures burst on him in their halfforgotten splendour filling his soul with the long echoes of beauty after all his life had been too starved suddenly before an effulgent titian he found himself saying but im only fiftyseven and then he turned away for such summer dreams it was too late but surely not for a quiet harvest of friendship of comradeship in the blessed hush of her nearness he went back to the hotel where he and dallas were to meet and together they walked again across the place de la concorde and over the bridge that leads to the chamber of deputies dallas unconscious of what was going on in his fathers mind was talking excitedly and abundantly of versailles he had had but one previous glimpse of it during a holiday trip in which he had tried to pack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with the family to switzerland and tumultuous enthusiasm and cocksure criticism tripped each other up on his lips as archer listened his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness increased the boy was not insensitive he knew but he had the facility and selfconfidence that came of looking at fate not as a master but as an equal thats it they feel equal to thingsthey know their way about he mused thinking of his son as the spokesman of the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks and with them the signposts and the dangersignal suddenly dallas stopped short grasping his fathers arm oh by jove he exclaimed they had come out into the great treeplanted space before the invalides the dome of mansart floated ethereally above the budding trees and the long grey front of the building drawing up into itself all the rays of afternoon light it hung there like the visible symbol of the races glory archer knew that madame olenska lived in a square near one of the avenues radiating from the invalides and he had pictured the quarter as quiet and almost obscure forgetting the central splendour that lit it up now by some queer process of association that golden light became for him the pervading illumination in which she lived for nearly thirty years her lifeof which he knew so strangely littlehad been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to be too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs he thought of the theatres she must have been to the pictures she must have looked at the sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented the people she must have talked with the incessant stir of ideas curiosities images and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a setting of immemorial manners and suddenly he remembered the young frenchman who had once said to him ah good conversationthere is nothing like it is there archer had not seen m riviere or heard of him for nearly thirty years and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of madame olenskas existence more than half a lifetime divided them and she had spent the long interval among people he did not know in a society he but faintly guessed at in conditions he would never wholly understand during that time he had been living with his youthful memory of her but she had doubtless had other and more tangible companionship perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something apart but if she had it must have been like a relic in a small dim chapel where there was not time to pray every day they had crossed the place des invalides and were walking down one of the thoroughfares flanking the building it was a quiet quarter after all in spite of its splendour and its history and the fact gave one an idea of the riches paris had to draw on since such scenes as this were left to the few and the indifferent the day was fading into a soft sunshot haze pricked here and there by a yellow electric light and passers were rare in the little square into which they had turned dallas stopped again and looked up it must be here he said slipping his arm through his fathers with a movement from which archers shyness did not shrink and they stood together looking up at the house it was a modern building without distinctive character but manywindowed and pleasantly balconied up its wide creamcoloured front on one of the upper balconies which hung well above the rounded tops of the horsechestnuts in the square the awnings were still lowered as though the sun had just left it i wonder which floor dallas conjectured and moving toward the portecochere he put his head into the porters lodge and came back to say the fifth it must be the one with the awnings archer remained motionless gazing at the upper windows as if the end of their pilgrimage had been attained i say you know its nearly six his son at length reminded him the father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees i believe ill sit there a moment he said whyarent you well his son exclaimed oh perfectly but i should like you please to go up without me dallas paused before him visibly bewildered but i say dad do you mean you wont come up at all i dont know said archer slowly if you dont she wont understand go my boy perhaps i shall follow you dallas gave him a long look through the twilight but what on earth shall i say my dear fellow dont you always know what to say his father rejoined with a smile very well i shall say youre oldfashioned and prefer walking up the five flights because you dont like lifts his father smiled again say im oldfashioned thats enough dallas looked at him again and then with an incredulous gesture passed out of sight under the vaulted doorway archer sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony he calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor to ring the bell and be admitted to the hall and then ushered into the drawingroom he pictured dallas entering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful smile and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy took after him then he tried to see the persons already in the roomfor probably at that sociable hour there would be more than oneand among them a dark lady pale and dark who would look up quickly half rise and hold out a long thin hand with three rings on it he thought she would be sitting in a sofacorner near the fire with azaleas banked behind her on a table its more real to me here than if i went up he suddenly heard himself say and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other he sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk his eyes never turning from the balcony at length a light shone through the windows and a moment later a manservant came out on the balcony drew up the awnings and closed the shutters at that as if it had been the signal he waited for newland archer got up slowly and walked back alone to his hotel a note on the text the age of innocence first appeared in four large installments in the pictorial review from july to october 1920 it was published that same year in book form by d

catherine and raina that escaped serbs fleeing the battlefield might be in the area seeking refuge in the houses of bulgarian families raina is not worried and chooses to keep her window unlocked in the night a man enters the room through the unlocked window and says he will kill raina if she makes a noise the man is swiss and an escaped soldier fighting as a mercenary for the serbians raina is shocked to see that the man is tired and hungry that he does not glorify battle and that he is merely happy to have escaped the carnage alive raina helps him hide behind a curtain just as catherine louka and a bulgarian officer enter to search the room for any serbs who might be hiding in the area raina convinces them that no one is in her room and they leave raina gives the man chocolate creams which she keeps in a box in her room and is shocked to hear that the man has no ammunition for his pistol as he normally only keeps candies in his pockets the man argues that sergiuss cavalry charge against the serbs was foolish and succeeded only by sheer luck the serbs had machine guns but were given the wrong ammunition by accident and therefore could not mow down sergius and his men raina agrees to help the man escape later that night though she rebukes him for making fun of her fianc\\u00e9 sergius the man sleeps as raina enlists catherines help and when raina and catherine return

faithful to sergius and sergius is taken aback they exit a man named bluntschli enters the family garden and louka brings him to catherine catherine realizes that he is the man that hid in rainas room the same man that she and raina helped escape catherine worries that sergius and petkoff who are conferring over military plans in the library might encounter the soldier sergius and petkoff have no idea that the story they heard about a soldier being helped by two bulgarian women involves the petkoffs bluntschli has come to return major petkoffs coat that catherine and raina lent him to escape

night a comedy by oliver goldsmith is a comedic play written during the late 18th century the plot revolves around a series of misunderstandings and mistaken identities particularly focusing on the interactions between the characters young marlow who is shy around respectable women and miss hardcastle who finds herself in the midst of a confusing courtship this comedy of errors also features a variety of humorous and eccentric characters including the mischievous tony lumpkin who complicates matters with his pranks at the start of the play we are introduced to mr and mrs hardcastle who

            "{'input': 'a shifting reef the year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon which doubtless no one has yet forgotten not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind even in the interior of continents seafaring men were particularly excited merchants common sailors captains of vessels skippers both of europe and america naval officers of all countries and the governments of several states on the two continents were deeply interested in the matter for some time past vessels had been met by an enormous thing a long object spindleshaped occasionally phosphorescent and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale the facts relating to this apparition entered in various logbooks agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question the untiring rapidity of its movements its surprising power of locomotion and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed if it was a whale it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers timesrejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in lengthwe might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day if it existed at all and that it did exist was an undeniable fact and with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition as to classing it in the list of fables the idea was out of the question on the 20th of july 1866 the steamer governor higginson of the calcutta and burnach steam navigation company had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of australia captain baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water projected by the mysterious object shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air now unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser the governor higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal unknown till then which threw up from its blowholes columns of water mixed with air and vapour similar facts were observed on the 23rd of july in the same year in the pacific ocean by the columbus of the west india and pacific steam navigation company but this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity as in an interval of three days the governor higginson and the columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues fifteen days later two thousand miles farther off the helvetia of the compagnienationale and the shannon of the royal mail steamship company sailing to windward in that portion of the atlantic lying between the united states and europe respectively signalled the monster to each other in 42 deg 15 n lat and 60 deg 35 w long in these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred and fifty feet as the shannon and helvetia were of smaller dimensions than it though they measured three hundred feet over all now the largest whales those which frequent those parts of the sea round the aleutian kulammak and umgullich islands have never exceeded the length of sixty yards if they attain that in every place of great resort the monster was the fashion they sang of it in the cafes ridiculed it in the papers and represented it on the stage all kinds of stories were circulated regarding it there appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary creature from the white whale the terrible moby dick of subarctic regions to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle a ship of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean the legends of ancient times were even revived then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals the question of the monster inflamed all minds editors of scientific journals quarrelling with believers in the supernatural spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign some even drawing blood for from the seaserpent they came to direct personalities during the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried never to revive when new facts were brought before the public it was then no longer a scientific problem to be solved but a real danger seriously to be avoided the question took quite another shape the monster became a small island a rock a reef but a reef of indefinite and shifting proportions on the 5th of march 1867 the moravian of the montreal ocean company finding herself during the night in 27 deg 30 lat and 72 deg 15 long struck on her starboard quarter a rock marked in no chart for that part of the sea under the combined efforts of the wind and its four hundred horse power it was going at the rate of thirteen knots had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the moravian she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the 237 passengers she was bringing home from canada the accident happened about five oclock in the morning as the day was breaking the officers of the quarterdeck hurried to the afterpart of the vessel they examined the sea with the most careful attention they saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables length distant as if the surface had been violently agitated the bearings of the place were taken exactly and the moravian continued its route without apparent damage had it struck on a submerged rock or on an enormous wreck they could not tell but on examination of the ships bottom when undergoing repairs it was found that part of her keel was broken this fact so grave in itself might perhaps have been forgotten like many others if three weeks after it had not been reenacted under similar circumstances but thanks to the nationality of the victim of the shock thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel belonged the circumstance became extensively circulated the 13th of april 1867 the sea being beautiful the breeze favourable the scotia of the cunard companys line found herself in 15 deg 12 long and 45 deg 37 lat she was going at the speed of thirteen knots and a half at seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon whilst the passengers were assembled at lunch in the great saloon a slight shock was felt on the hull of the scotia on her quarter a little aft of the portpaddle the scotia had not struck but she had been struck and seemingly by something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt the shock had been so slight that no one had been alarmed had it not been for the shouts of the carpenters watch who rushed on to the bridge exclaiming we are sinking we are sinking at first the passengers were much frightened but captain anderson hastened to reassure them the danger could not be imminent the scotia divided into seven compartments by strong partitions could brave with impunity any leak captain anderson went down immediately into the hold he found that the sea was pouring into the fifth compartment and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of the water was considerable fortunately this compartment did not hold the boilers or the fires would have been immediately extinguished captain anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at once and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the injury some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a large hole two yards in diameter in the ships bottom such a leak could not be stopped and the scotia her paddles half submerged was obliged to continue her course she was then three hundred miles from cape clear and after three days delay which caused great uneasiness in liverpool she entered the basin of the company the engineers visited the scotia which was put in dry dock they could scarcely believe it possible at two yards and a half below watermark was a regular rent in the form of an isosceles triangle the broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch it was clear then that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp and after having been driven with prodigious strength and piercing an iron plate 1 38 inches thick had withdrawn itself by a backward motion such was the last fact which resulted in exciting once more the torrent of public opinion from this moment all unlucky casualties which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these shipwrecks which unfortunately were considerable for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at lloyds the number of sailing and steamships supposed to be totally lost from the absence of all news amounted to not less than two hundred now it was the monster who justly or unjustly was accused of their disappearance and thanks to it communication between the different continents became more and more dangerous the public demanded sharply that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable cetacean1 1 member of the whale family pro and con at the period when these events took place i had just returned from a scientific research in the disagreeable territory of nebraska in the united states in virtue of my office as assistant professor in the museum of natural history in paris the french government had attached me to that expedition after six months in nebraska i arrived in new york towards the end of march laden with a precious collection my departure for france was fixed for the first days in may meanwhile i was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical botanical and zoological riches when the accident happened to the scotia i was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day how could i be otherwise i had read and reread all the american and european papers without being any nearer a conclusion this mystery puzzled me under the impossibility of forming an opinion i jumped from one extreme to the other that there really was something could not be doubted and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on the wound of the scotia on my arrival at new york the question was at its height the theory of the floating island and the unapproachable sandbank supported by minds little competent to form a judgment was abandoned and indeed unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity from the same cause the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given up there remained then only two possible solutions of the question which created two distinct parties on one side those who were for a monster of colossal strength on the other those who were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power but this last theory plausible as it was could not stand against inquiries made in both worlds that a private gentleman should have such a machine at his command was not likely where when and how was it built and how could its construction have been kept secret certainly a government might possess such a destructive machine and in these disastrous times when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the power of weapons of war it was possible that without the knowledge of others a state might try to work such a formidable engine but the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of governments as public interest was in question and transatlantic communications suffered their veracity could not be doubted but how admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the public eye for a private gentleman to keep the secret under such circumstances would be very difficult and for a state whose every act is persistently watched by powerful rivals certainly impossible upon my arrival in new york several persons did me the honour of consulting me on the phenomenon in question i had published in france a work in quarto in two volumes entitled mysteries of the great submarine grounds this book highly approved of in the learned world gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of natural history my advice was asked as long as i could deny the reality of the fact i confined myself to a decided negative but soon finding myself driven into a corner i was obliged to explain myself point by point i discussed the question in all its forms politically and scientifically and i give here an extract from a carefullystudied article which i published in the number of the 30th of april it ran as follows after examining one by one the different theories rejecting all other suggestions it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power the great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us soundings cannot reach them what passes in those remote depthswhat beings live or can live twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waterswhat is the organisation of these animals we can scarcely conjecture however the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma either we do know all the varieties of beings which people our planet or we do not if we do not know them allif nature has still secrets in the deeps for us nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes or cetaceans of other kinds or even of new species of an organisation formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings and which an accident of some sort has brought at long intervals to the upper level of the ocean if on the contrary we do know all living kinds we must necessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already classed and in that case i should be disposed to admit the existence of a gigantic narwhal the common narwhal or unicorn of the sea often attains a length of sixty feet increase its size fivefold or tenfold give it strength proportionate to its size lengthen its destructive weapons and you obtain the animal required it will have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon the instrument required by the perforation of the scotia and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the steamer indeed the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword a halberd according to the expression of certain naturalists the principal tusk has the hardness of steel some of these tusks have been found buried in the bodies of whales which the unicorn always attacks with success others have been drawn out not without trouble from the bottoms of ships which they had pierced through and through as a gimlet pierces a barrel the museum of the faculty of medicine of paris possesses one of these defensive weapons two yards and a quarter in length and fifteen inches in diameter at the base very well suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required until further information therefore i shall maintain it to be a seaunicorn of colossal dimensions armed not with a halberd but with a real spur as the armoured frigates or the rams of war whose massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time thus may this puzzling phenomenon be explained unless there be something over and above all that one has ever conjectured seen perceived or experienced which is just within the bounds of possibility these last words were cowardly on my part but up to a certain point i wished to shelter my dignity as professor and not give too much cause for laughter to the americans who laugh well when they do laugh i reserved for myself a way of escape in effect however i admitted the existence of the monster my article was warmly discussed which procured it a high reputation it rallied round it a certain number of partisans the solution it proposed gave at least full liberty to the imagination the human mind delights in grand conceptions of supernatural beings and the sea is precisely their best vehicle the only medium through which these giants against which terrestrial animals such as elephants or rhinoceroses are as nothing can be produced or developed the industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from this point of view the shipping and mercantile gazette the lloyds list the packetboat and the maritime and colonial review all papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of premium were unanimous on this point public opinion had been pronounced the united states were the first in the field and in new york they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this narwhal a frigate of great speed the abraham lincoln was put in commission as soon as possible the arsenals were opened to commander farragut who hastened the arming of his frigate but as it always happens the moment it was decided to pursue the monster the monster did not appear for two months no one heard it spoken of no ship met with it it seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around it it had been so much talked of even through the atlantic cable that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on its passage and was making the most of it so when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign and provided with formidable fishing apparatus no one could tell what course to pursue impatience grew apace when on the 2nd of july they learned that a steamer of the line of san francisco from california to shanghai had seen the animal three weeks before in the north pacific ocean the excitement caused by this news was extreme the ship was revictualled and well stocked with coal three hours before the abraham lincoln left brooklyn pier i received a letter worded as follows to m aronnax professor in the museum of paris fifth avenue hotel new york sirif you will consent to join the abraham lincoln in this expedition the government of the united states will with pleasure see france represented in the enterprise commander farragut has a cabin at your disposal very cordially yours jb hobson secretary of marine i form my resolution three seconds before the arrival of j b hobsons letter i no more thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the north sea three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable secretary of marine i felt that my true vocation the sole end of my life was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world but i had just returned from a fatiguing journey weary and longing for repose i aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country my friends my little lodging by the jardin des plantes my dear and precious collectionsbut nothing could keep me back i forgot allfatigue friends and collectionsand accepted without hesitation the offer of the american government besides thought i all roads lead back to europe and the unicorn may be amiable enough to hurry me towards the coast of france this worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of europe for my particular benefit and i will not bring back less than half a yard of his ivory halberd to the museum of natural history but in the meanwhile i must seek this narwhal in the north pacific ocean which to return to france was taking the road to the antipodes conseil i called in an impatient voice conseil was my servant a true devoted flemish boy who had accompanied me in all my travels i liked him and he returned the liking well he was quiet by nature regular from principle zealous from habit evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of life very quick with his hands and apt at any service required of him and despite his name never giving adviceeven when asked for it conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey never make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might be or however far away whether china or congo besides all this he had good health which defied all sickness and solid muscles but no nerves good morals are understood this boy was thirty years old and his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty may i be excused for saying that i was forty years old but conseil had one fault he was ceremonious to a degree and would never speak to me but in the third person which was sometimes provoking conseil said i again beginning with feverish hands to make preparations for my departure certainly i was sure of this devoted boy as a rule i never asked him if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels but this time the expedition in question might be prolonged and the enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell here there was matter for reflection even to the most impassive man in the world what would conseil say conseil i called a third time conseil appeared did you call sir said he entering yes my boy make preparations for me and yourself too we leave in two hours as you please sir replied conseil quietly not an instant to lose lock in my trunk all travelling utensils coats shirts and stockingswithout counting as many as you can and make haste and your collections sir observed conseil they will keep them at the hotel we are not returning to paris then said conseil oh certainly i answered evasively by making a curve will the curve please you sir oh it will be nothing not quite so direct a road that is all we take our passage in the abraham lincoln as you think proper sir coolly replied conseil you see my friend it has to do with the monsterthe famous narwhal we are going to purge it from the seas a glorious mission but a dangerous one we cannot tell where we may go these animals can be very capricious but we will go whether or no we have got a captain who is pretty wideawake our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately i hastened on board and asked for commander farragut one of the sailors conducted me to the poop where i found myself in the presence of a goodlooking officer who held out his hand to me monsieur pierre aronnax said he himself replied i commander farragut you are welcome professor your cabin is ready for you i bowed and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me the abraham lincoln had been well chosen and equipped for her new destination she was a frigate of great speed fitted with highpressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres under this the abraham lincoln attained the mean speed of nearly eighteen knots and a third an houra considerable speed but nevertheless insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean the interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical qualities i was well satisfied with my cabin which was in the after part opening upon the gunroom we shall be well off here said i to conseil as well by your honours leave as a hermitcrab in the shell of a whelk said conseil i left conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away and remounted the poop in order to survey the preparations for departure at that moment commander farragut was ordering the last moorings to be cast loose which held the abraham lincoln to the pier of brooklyn so in a quarter of an hour perhaps less the frigate would have sailed without me i should have missed this extraordinary supernatural and incredible expedition the recital of which may well meet with some suspicion but commander farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted he sent for the engineer is the steam full on asked he yes sir replied the engineer go ahead cried commander farragut ned land captain farragut was a good seaman worthy of the frigate he commanded his vessel and he were one he was the soul of it on the question of the monster there was no doubt in his mind and he would not allow the existence of the animal to be disputed on board he believed in it as certain good women believe in the leviathanby faith not by reason the monster did exist and he had sworn to rid the seas of it either captain farragut would kill the narwhal or the narwhal would kill the captain there was no third course the officers on board shared the opinion of their chief they were ever chatting discussing and calculating the various chances of a meeting watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean more than one took up his quarters voluntarily in the crosstrees who would have cursed such a berth under any other circumstances as long as the sun described its daily course the rigging was crowded with sailors whose feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it unbearable still the abraham lincoln had not yet breasted the suspected waters of the pacific as to the ships company they desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn to harpoon it hoist it on board and despatch it they watched the sea with eager attention besides captain farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand dollars set apart for whoever should first sight the monster were he cabinboy common seaman or officer i leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the abraham lincoln for my own part i was not behind the others and left to no one my share of daily observations the frigate might have been called the argus for a hundred reasons only one amongst us conseil seemed to protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us all and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on board i have said that captain farragut had carefully provided his ship with every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean no whaler had ever been better armed we possessed every known engine from the harpoon thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss and the explosive balls of the duckgun on the forecastle lay the perfection of a breechloading gun very thick at the breech and very narrow in the bore the model of which had been in the exhibition of 1867 this precious weapon of american origin could throw with ease a conical projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles thus the abraham lincoln wanted for no means of destruction and what was better still she had on board ned land the prince of harpooners ned land was a canadian with an uncommon quickness of hand and who knew no equal in his dangerous occupation skill coolness audacity and cunning he possessed in a superior degree and it must be a cunning whale to escape the stroke of his harpoon ned land was about forty years of age he was a tall man more than six feet high strongly built grave and taciturn occasionally violent and very passionate when contradicted his person attracted attention but above all the boldness of his look which gave a singular expression to his face who calls himself canadian calls himself french and little communicative as ned land was i must admit that he took a certain liking for me my nationality drew him to me no doubt it was an opportunity for him to talk and for me to hear that old language of rabelais which is still in use in some canadian provinces the harpooners family was originally from quebec and was already a tribe of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to france little by little ned land acquired a taste for chatting and i loved to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas he related his fishing and his combats with natural poetry of expression his recital took the form of an epic poem and i seemed to be listening to a canadian homer singing the iliad of the regions of the north i am portraying this hardy companion as i really knew him we are old friends now united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and cemented amidst extreme dangers ah brave ned i ask no more than to live a hundred years longer that i may have more time to dwell the longer on your memory now what was ned lands opinion upon the question of the marine monster i must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn and was the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction he even avoided the subject which i one day thought it my duty to press upon him one magnificent evening the 30th july that is to say three weeks after our departure the frigate was abreast of cape blanc thirty miles to leeward of the coast of patagonia we had crossed the tropic of capricorn and the straits of magellan opened less than seven hundred miles to the south before eight days were over the abraham lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the pacific seated on the poop ned land and i were chatting of one thing and another as we looked at this mysterious sea whose great depths had up to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man i naturally led up the conversation to the giant unicorn and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition but seeing that ned land let me speak without saying too much himself i pressed him more closely well ned said i is it possible that you are not convinced of the existence of this cetacean that we are following have you any particular reason for being so incredulous the harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering struck his broad forehead with his hand a habit of his as if to collect himself and said at last perhaps i have mr aronnax but ned you a whaler by profession familiarised with all the great marine mammaliayou ought to be the last to doubt under such circumstances that is just what deceives you professor replied ned as a whaler i have followed many a cetacean harpooned a great number and killed several but however strong or wellarmed they may have been neither their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer but ned they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have pierced through and through wooden shipsthat is possible replied the canadian but i have never seen it done and until further proof i deny that whales cetaceans or seaunicorns could ever produce the effect you describe well ned i repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of facts i believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised belonging to the branch of vertebrata like the whales the cachalots or the dolphins and furnished with a horn of defence of great penetrating power hum said the harpooner shaking his head with the air of a man who would not be convinced notice one thing my worthy canadian i resumed if such an animal is in existence if it inhabits the depths of the ocean if it frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water it must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would defy all comparison and why this powerful organisation demanded ned because it requires incalculable strength to keep ones self in these strata and resist their pressure listen to me let us admit that the pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of water thirtytwo feet high in reality the column of water would be shorter as we are speaking of sea water the density of which is greater than that of fresh water very well when you dive ned as many times 32 feet of water as there are above you so many times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere that is to say 15 lb for each square inch of its surface it follows then that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres of 100 atmospheres at 3200 feet and of 1000 atmospheres at 32000 feet that is about 6 miles which is equivalent to saying that if you could attain this depth in the ocean each square threeeighths of an inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5600 lb ah my brave ned do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface of your body i have no idea mr aronnax about 6500 and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15 lb to the square inch your 6500 square inches bear at this moment a pressure of 97500 lb without my perceiving it without your perceiving it and if you are not crushed by such a pressure it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and exterior pressure which thus neutralise each other and which allows you to bear it without inconvenience but in the water it is another thing yes i understand replied ned becoming more attentive because the water surrounds me but does not penetrate precisely ned so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you would undergo a pressure of 97500 lb at 320 feet ten times that pressure at 3200 feet a hundred times that pressure lastly at 32000 feet a thousand times that pressure would be 97500000 lbthat is to say that you would be flattened as if you had been drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine the devil exclaimed ned very well my worthy harpooner if some vertebrate several hundred yards long and large in proportion can maintain itself in such depthsof those whose surface is represented by millions of square inches that is by tens of millions of pounds we must estimate the pressure they undergo consider then what must be the resistance of their bony structure and the strength of their organisation to withstand such pressure why exclaimed ned land they must be made of iron plates eight inches thick like the armoured frigates as you say ned and think what destruction such a mass would cause if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a vessel yescertainlyperhaps replied the canadian shaken by these figures but not yet willing to give in well have i convinced you you have convinced me of one thing sir which is that if such animals do exist at the bottom of the seas they must necessarily be as strong as you say but if they do not exist mine obstinate harpooner how explain the accident to the scotia at a venture the voyage of the abraham lincoln was for a long time marked by no special incident but one circumstance happened which showed the wonderful dexterity of ned land and proved what confidence we might place in him the 30th of june the frigate spoke some american whalers from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal but one of them the captain of the monroe knowing that ned land had shipped on board the abraham lincoln begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in sight commander farragut desirous of seeing ned land at work gave him permission to go on board the monroe and fate served our canadian so well that instead of one whale he harpooned two with a double blow striking one straight to the heart and catching the other after some minutes pursuit decidedly if the monster ever had to do with ned lands harpoon i would not bet in its favour the frigate skirted the southeast coast of america with great rapidity the 3rd of july we were at the opening of the straits of magellan level with cape vierges but commander farragut would not take a tortuous passage but doubled cape horn the ships crew agreed with him and certainly it was possible that they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass many of the sailors affirmed that the monster could not pass there that he was too big for that the 6th of july about three oclock in the afternoon the abraham lincoln at fifteen miles to the south doubled the solitary island this lost rock at the extremity of the american continent to which some dutch sailors gave the name of their native town cape horn the course was taken towards the northwest and the next day the screw of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the pacific keep your eyes open called out the sailors and they were opened widely both eyes and glasses a little dazzled it is true by the prospect of two thousand dollars had not an instants repose i myself for whom money had no charms was not the least attentive on board giving but few minutes to my meals but a few hours to sleep indifferent to either rain or sunshine i did not leave the poop of the vessel now leaning on the netting of the forecastle now on the taffrail i devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as the eye could reach and how often have i shared the emotion of the majority of the crew when some capricious whale raised its black back above the waves the poop of the vessel was crowded on a moment the cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the cetacean i looked and looked till i was nearly blind whilst conseil kept repeating in a calm voice if sir you would not squint so much you would see better but vain excitement the abraham lincoln checked its speed and made for the animal signalled a simple whale or common cachalot which soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse but the weather was good the voyage was being accomplished under the most favourable auspices it was then the bad season in australia the july of that zone corresponding to our january in europe but the sea was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference the 20th of july the tropic of capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude and the 27th of the same month we crossed the equator on the 110th meridian this passed the frigate took a more decided westerly direction and scoured the central waters of the pacific commander farragut thought and with reason that it was better to remain in deep water and keep clear of continents or islands which the beast itself seemed to shun perhaps because there was not enough water for him suggested the greater part of the crew the frigate passed at some distance from the marquesas and the sandwich islands crossed the tropic of cancer and made for the china seas we were on the theatre of the last diversions of the monster and to say truth we no longer lived on board the entire ships crew were undergoing a nervous excitement of which i can give no idea they could not eat they could not sleeptwenty times a day a misconception or an optical illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail would cause dreadful perspirations and these emotions twenty times repeated kept us in a state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable and truly reaction soon showed itself for three months during which a day seemed an age the abraham lincoln furrowed all the waters of the northern pacific running at whales making sharp deviations from her course veering suddenly from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery and not one point of the japanese or american coast was left unexplored the warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent detractors reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself and certainly had it not been for the resolute determination on the part of captain farragut the frigate would have headed due southward this useless search could not last much longer the abraham lincoln had nothing to reproach herself with she had done her best to succeed never had an american ships crew shown more zeal or patience its failure could not be placed to their chargethere remained nothing but to return this was represented to the commander the sailors could not hide their discontent and the service suffered i will not say there was a mutiny on board but after a reasonable period of obstinacy captain farragut as columbus did asked for three days patience if in three days the monster did not appear the man at the helm should give three turns of the wheel and the abraham lincoln would make for the european seas this promise was made on the 2nd of november it had the effect of rallying the ships crew the ocean was watched with renewed attention each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance glasses were used with feverish activity it was a grand defiance given to the giant narwhal and he could scarcely fail to answer the summons and appear two days passed the steam was at half pressure a thousand schemes were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the animal in case it should be met in those parts large quantities of bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship to the great satisfaction i must say of the sharks small craft radiated in all directions round the abraham lincoln as she lay to and did not leave a spot of the sea unexplored but the night of the 4th of november arrived without the unveiling of this submarine mystery the next day the 5th of november at twelve the delay would morally speaking expire after that time commander farragut faithful to his promise was to turn the course to the southeast and abandon for ever the northern regions of the pacific the frigate was then in 31 deg 15 n lat and 136 deg 42 e long the coast of japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward night was approaching they had just struck eight bells large clouds veiled the face of the moon then in its first quarter the sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel at that moment i was leaning forward on the starboard netting conseil standing near me was looking straight before him the crew perched in the ratlines examined the horizon which contracted and darkened by degrees officers with their night glasses scoured the growing darkness sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon which darted between two clouds then all trace of light was lost in the darkness in looking at conseil i could see he was undergoing a little of the general influence at least i thought so perhaps for the first time his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity come conseil said i this is the last chance of pocketing the two thousand dollars may i be permitted to say sir replied conseil that i never reckoned on getting the prize and had the government of the union offered a hundred thousand dollars it would have been none the poorer you are right conseil it is a foolish affair after all and one upon which we entered too lightly what time lost what useless emotions we should have been back in france six months ago in your little room sir replied conseil and in your museum sir and i should have already classed all your fossils sir and the babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the jardin des plantes and have drawn all the curious people of the capital as you say conseil i fancy we shall run a fair chance of being laughed at for our pains thats tolerably certain replied conseil quietly i think they will make fun of you sir and must i say it go on my good friend well sir you will only get your deserts indeed when one has the honour of being a _savant_ as you are sir one should not expose ones self to conseil had not time to finish his compliment in the midst of general silence a voice had just been heard it was the voice of ned land shouting look out there the very thing we are looking foron our weather beam at full steam at this cry the whole ships crew hurried towards the harpoonercommander officers masters sailors cabin boys even the engineers left their engines and the stokers their furnaces the order to stop her had been given and the frigate now simply went on by her own momentum the darkness was then profound and however good the canadians eyes were i asked myself how he had managed to see and what he had been able to see my heart beat as if it would break but ned land was not mistaken and we all perceived the object he pointed to at two cables length from the abraham lincoln on the starboard quarter the sea seemed to be illuminated all over it was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon the monster emerged some fathoms from the water and then threw out that very intense but mysterious light mentioned in the report of several captains this magnificent irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great shining power the luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval much elongated the centre of which condensed a burning heat whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations it is only a massing of phosphoric particles cried one of the officers no sir certainly not i replied that brightness is of an essentially electrical nature besides see see it moves it is moving forwards backwards it is darting towards us a general cry arose from the frigate silence said the captain up with the helm reverse the engines the steam was shut off and the abraham lincoln beating to port described a semicircle right the helm go ahead cried the captain these orders were executed and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light i was mistaken she tried to sheer off but the supernatural animal approached with a velocity double her own we gasped for breath stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and motionless the animal gained on us sporting with the waves it made the round of the frigate which was then making fourteen knots and enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust then it moved away two or three miles leaving a phosphorescent track like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind all at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain its momentum the monster rushed suddenly towards the abraham lincoln with alarming rapidity stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull and died outnot diving under the water for its brilliancy did not abatebut suddenly and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel as if it had turned and slid under the hull any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us however i was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate she fled and did not attack on the captains face generally so impassive was an expression of unaccountable astonishment mr aronnax he said i do not know with what formidable being i have to deal and i will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst of this darkness besides how attack this unknown thing how defend ones self from it wait for daylight and the scene will change you have no further doubt captain of the nature of the animal no sir it is evidently a gigantic narwhal and an electric one perhaps added i one can only approach it with a torpedo undoubtedly replied the captain if it possesses such dreadful power it is the most terrible animal that ever was created that is why sir i must be on my guard the crew were on their feet all night no one thought of sleep the abraham lincoln not being able to struggle with such velocity had moderated its pace and sailed at half speed for its part the narwhal imitating the frigate let the waves rock it at will and seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle towards midnight however it disappeared or to use a more appropriate term it died out like a large glowworm had it fled one could only fear not hope it but at seven minutes to one oclock in the morning a deafening whistling was heard like that produced by a body of water rushing with great violence the captain ned land and i were then on the poop eagerly peering through the profound darkness ned land asked the commander you have often heard the roaring of whales often sir but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars if i can only approach within four harpoons length of it but to approach it said the commander i ought to put a whaler at your disposal certainly sir that will be trifling with the lives of my men and mine too simply said the harpooner towards two oclock in the morning the burning light reappeared not less intense about five miles to windward of the abraham lincoln notwithstanding the distance and the noise of the wind and sea one heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animals tail and even its panting breath it seemed that at the moment that the enormous narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water the air was engulfed in its lungs like the steam in the vast cylinders of a machine of two thousand horsepower hum thought i a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment would be a pretty whale we were on the qui vive till daylight and prepared for the combat the fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings the second lieutenant loaded the blunder busses which could throw harpoons to the distance of a mile and long duckguns with explosive bullets which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals ned land contented himself with sharpening his harpoona terrible weapon in his hands at six oclock day began to break and with the first glimmer of light the electric light of the narwhal disappeared at seven oclock the day was sufficiently advanced but a very thick sea fog obscured our view and the best spy glasses could not pierce it that caused disappointment and anger i climbed the mizzenmast some officers were already perched on the mastheads at eight oclock the fog lay heavily on the waves and its thick scrolls rose little by little the horizon grew wider and clearer at the same time suddenly just as on the day before ned lands voice was heard the thing itself on the port quarter cried the harpooner every eye was turned towards the point indicated there a mile and a half from the frigate a long blackish body emerged a yard above the waves its tail violently agitated produced a considerable eddy never did a tail beat the sea with such violence an immense track of dazzling whiteness marked the passage of the animal and described a long curve the frigate approached the cetacean i examined it thoroughly the reports of the shannon and of the helvetia had rather exaggerated its size and i estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty feet as to its dimensions i could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned while i watched this phenomenon two jets of steam and water were ejected from its vents and rose to the height of 120 feet thus i ascertained its way of breathing i concluded definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch class mammalia the crew waited impatiently for their chiefs orders the latter after having observed the animal attentively called the engineer the engineer ran to him sir said the commander you have steam up yes sir answered the engineer well make up your fires and put on all steam three hurrahs greeted this order the time for the struggle had arrived some moments after the two funnels of the frigate vomited torrents of black smoke and the bridge quaked under the trembling of the boilers the abraham lincoln propelled by her wonderful screw went straight at the animal the latter allowed it to come within half a cables length then as if disdaining to dive it took a little turn and stopped a short distance off this pursuit lasted nearly threequarters of an hour without the frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean it was quite evident that at that rate we should never come up with it well mr land asked the captain do you advise me to put the boats out to sea no sir replied ned land because we shall not take that beast easily what shall we do then put on more steam if you can sir with your leave i mean to post myself under the bowsprit and if we get within harpooning distance i shall throw my harpoon go ned said the captain engineer put on more pressure ned land went to his post the fires were increased the screw revolved fortythree times a minute and the steam poured out of the valves we heaved the log and calculated that the abraham lincoln was going at the rate of 18 12 miles an hour but the accursed animal swam at the same speed for a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace without gaining six feet it was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the american navy a stubborn anger seized the crew the sailors abused the monster who as before disdained to answer them the captain no longer contented himself with twisting his beardhe gnawed it the engineer was called again you have turned full steam on yes sir replied the engineer the speed of the abraham lincoln increased its masts trembled down to their stepping holes and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out of the narrow funnels they heaved the log a second time well asked the captain of the man at the wheel nineteen miles and threetenths sir clap on more steam the engineer obeyed the manometer showed ten degrees but the cetacean grew warm itself no doubt for without straining itself it made 19 310 miles what a pursuit no i cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through me ned land kept his post harpoon in hand several times the animal let us gain upon itwe shall catch it we shall catch it cried the canadian but just as he was going to strike the cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour and even during our maximum of speed it bullied the frigate going round and round it a cry of fury broke from everyone at noon we were no further advanced than at eight oclock in the morning the captain then decided to take more direct means ah said he that animal goes quicker than the abraham lincoln very well we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets send your men to the forecastle sir the forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round but the shot passed some feet above the cetacean which was half a mile off another more to the right cried the commander and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast an old gunner with a grey beardthat i can see nowwith steady eye and grave face went up to the gun and took a long aim a loud report was heard with which were mingled the cheers of the crew the bullet did its work it hit the animal and sliding off the rounded surface was lost in two miles depth of sea the chase began again and the captain leaning towards me said i will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up yes answered i and you will be quite right to do it i wished the beast would exhaust itself and not be insensible to fatigue like a steam engine but it was of no use hours passed without its showing any signs of exhaustion however it must be said in praise of the abraham lincoln that she struggled on indefatigably i cannot reckon the distance she made under three hundred miles during this unlucky day november the 6th but night came on and overshadowed the rough ocean now i thought our expedition was at an end and that we should never again see the extraordinary animal i was mistaken at ten minutes to eleven in the evening the electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate as pure as intense as during the preceding night the narwhal seemed motionless perhaps tired with its days work it slept letting itself float with the undulation of the waves now was a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage he gave his orders the abraham lincoln kept up half steam and advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary it is no rare thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that they can be successfully attacked and ned land had harpooned more than one during its sleep the canadian went to take his place again under the bowsprit the frigate approached noiselessly stopped at two cables lengths from the animal and following its track no one breathed a deep silence reigned on the bridge we were not a hundred feet from the burning focus the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes at this moment leaning on the forecastle bulwark i saw below me ned land grappling the martingale in one hand brandishing his terrible harpoon in the other scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal suddenly his arm straightened and the harpoon was thrown i heard the sonorous stroke of the weapon which seemed to have struck a hard body the electric light went out suddenly and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of the frigate rushing like a torrent from stem to stern overthrowing men and breaking the lashings of the spars a fearful shock followed and thrown over the rail without having time to stop myself i fell into the sea an unknown species of whale this unexpected fall so stunned me that i have no clear recollection of my sensations at the time i was at first drawn down to a depth of about twenty feet i am a good swimmer though without pretending to rival byron or edgar poe who were masters of the art and in that plunge i did not lose my presence of mind two vigorous strokes brought me to the surface of the water my first care was to look for the frigate had the crew seen me disappear had the abraham lincoln veered round would the captain put out a boat might i hope to be saved the darkness was intense i caught a glimpse of a black mass disappearing in the east its beacon lights dying out in the distance it was the frigate i was lost help help i shouted swimming towards the abraham lincoln in desperation my clothes encumbered me they seemed glued to my body and paralysed my movements i was sinking i was suffocating help this was my last cry my mouth filled with water i struggled against being drawn down the abyss suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong hand and i felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea and i heard yes i heard these words pronounced in my ear if master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder master would swim with much greater ease i seized with one hand my faithful conseils arm is it you said i you myself answered conseil and waiting masters orders that shock threw you as well as me into the sea no but being in my masters service i followed him the worthy fellow thought that was but natural and the frigate i asked the frigate replied conseil turning on his back i think that master had better not count too much on her you think so i say that at the time i threw myself into the sea i heard the men at the wheel say the screw and the rudder are broken broken yes broken by the monsters teeth it is the only injury the abraham lincoln has sustained but it is a bad lookout for usshe no longer answers her helm then we are lost perhaps so calmly answered conseil however we have still several hours before us and one can do a good deal in some hours conseils imperturbable coolness set me up again i swam more vigorously but cramped by my clothes which stuck to me like a leaden weight i felt great difficulty in bearing up conseil saw this will master let me make a slit said he and slipping an open knife under my clothes he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly then he cleverly slipped them off me while i swam for both of us then i did the same for conseil and we continued to swim near to each other nevertheless our situation was no less terrible perhaps our disappearance had not been noticed and if it had been the frigate could not tack being without its helm conseil argued on this supposition and laid his plans accordingly this quiet boy was perfectly selfpossessed we then decided that as our only chance of safety was being picked up by the abraham lincolns boats we ought to manage so as to wait for them as long as possible i resolved then to husband our strength so that both should not be exhausted at the same time and this is how we managed while one of us lay on our back quite still with arms crossed and legs stretched out the other would swim and push the other on in front this towing business did not last more than ten minutes each and relieving each other thus we could swim on for some hours perhaps till daybreak poor chance but hope is so firmly rooted in the heart of man moreover there were two of us indeed i declare though it may seem improbable if i sought to destroy all hopeif i wished to despair i could not the collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about eleven oclock in the evening before i reckoned then we should have eight hours to swim before sunrise an operation quite practicable if we relieved each other the sea very calm was in our favour sometimes i tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by our movements i watched the luminous waves that broke over my hand whose mirrorlike surface was spotted with silvery rings one might have said that we were in a bath of quicksilver near one oclock in the morning i was seized with dreadful fatigue my limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp conseil was obliged to keep me up and our preservation devolved on him alone i heard the poor boy pant his breathing became short and hurried i found that he could not keep up much longer leave me leave me i said to him leave my master never replied he i would drown first just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that the wind was driving to the east the surface of the sea glittered with its rays this kindly light reanimated us my head got better again i looked at all points of the horizon i saw the frigate she was five miles from us and looked like a dark mass hardly discernible but no boats i would have cried out but what good would it have been at such a distance my swollen lips could utter no sounds conseil could articulate some words and i heard him repeat at intervals help help our movements were suspended for an instant we listened it might be only a singing in the ear but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the cry from conseil did you hear i murmured yes yes and conseil gave one more despairing cry this time there was no mistake a human voice responded to ours was it the voice of another unfortunate creature abandoned in the middle of the ocean some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel or rather was it a boat from the frigate that was hailing us in the darkness conseil made a last effort and leaning on my shoulder while i struck out in a desperate effort he raised himself half out of the water then fell back exhausted what did you see i saw murmured he i sawbut do not talkreserve all your strength what had he seen then i know not why the thought of the monster came into my head for the first time but that voice the time is past for jonahs to take refuge in whales bellies however conseil was towing me again he raised his head sometimes looked before us and uttered a cry of recognition which was responded to by a voice that came nearer and nearer i scarcely heard it my strength was exhausted my fingers stiffened my hand afforded me support no longer my mouth convulsively opening filled with salt water cold crept over me i raised my head for the last time then i sank at this moment a hard body struck me i clung to it then i felt that i was being drawn up that i was brought to the surface of the water that my chest collapsedi fainted it is certain that i soon came to thanks to the vigorous rubbings that i received i half opened my eyes conseil i murmured does master call me asked conseil just then by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to the horizon i saw a face which was not conseils and which i immediately recognised ned i cried the same sir who is seeking his prize replied the canadian were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate yes professor but more fortunate than you i was able to find a footing almost directly upon a floating island an island or more correctly speaking on our gigantic narwhal explain yourself ned only i soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was blunted why ned why because professor that beast is made of sheet iron the canadians last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain i wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being or object half out of the water which served us for a refuge i kicked it it was evidently a hard impenetrable body and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia but this hard body might be a bony covering like that of the antediluvian animals and i should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles such as tortoises or alligators well no the blackish back that supported me was smooth polished without scales the blow produced a metallic sound and incredible though it may be it seemed i might say as if it was made of riveted plates there was no doubt about it this monster this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world and over thrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres it must be owned was a still more astonishing phenomenon inasmuch as it was a simply human construction we had no time to lose however we were lying upon the back of a sort of submarine boat which appeared as far as i could judge like a huge fish of steel ned lands mind was made up on this point conseil and i could only agree with him just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing which was evidently propelled by a screw and it began to move we had only just time to seize hold of the upper part which rose about seven feet out of the water and happily its speed was not great as long as it sails horizontally muttered ned land i do not mind but if it takes a fancy to dive i would not give two straws for my life the canadian might have said still less it became really necessary to communicate with the beings whatever they were shut up inside the machine i searched all over the outside for an aperture a panel or a manhole to use a technical expression but the lines of the iron rivets solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates were clear and uniform besides the moon disappeared then and left us in total darkness at last this long night passed my indistinct remembrance prevents my describing all the impressions it made i can only recall one circumstance during some lulls of the wind and sea i fancied i heard several times vague sounds a sort of fugitive harmony produced by words of command what was then the mystery of this submarine craft of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation what kind of beings existed in this strange boat what mechanical agent caused its prodigious speed daybreak appeared the morning mists surrounded us but they soon cleared off i was about to examine the hull which formed on deck a kind of horizontal platform when i felt it gradually sinking oh confound it cried ned land kicking the resounding plate open you inhospitable rascals happily the sinking movement ceased suddenly a noise like iron works violently pushed aside came from the interior of the boat one iron plate was moved a man appeared uttered an odd cry and disappeared immediately some moments after eight strong men with masked faces appeared noiselessly and drew us down into their formidable machine mobilis in mobili this forcible abduction so roughly carried out was accomplished with the rapidity of lightning i shivered all over whom had we to deal with no doubt some new sort of pirates who explored the sea in their own way hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me when i was enveloped in darkness my eyes dazzled with the outer light could distinguish nothing i felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an iron ladder ned land and conseil firmly seized followed me at the bottom of the ladder a door opened and shut after us immediately with a bang we were alone where i could not say hardly imagine all was black and such a dense black that after some minutes my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer meanwhile ned land furious at these proceedings gave free vent to his indignation confound it cried he here are people who come up to the scotch for hospitality they only just miss being cannibals i should not be surprised at it but i declare that they shall not eat me without my protesting calm yourself friend ned calm yourself replied conseil quietly do not cry out before you are hurt we are not quite done for yet not quite sharply replied the canadian but pretty near at all events things look black happily my bowie knife i have still and i can always see well enough to use it the first of these pirates who lays a hand on me do not excite yourself ned i said to the harpooner and do not compromise us by useless violence who knows that they will not listen to us let us rather try to find out where we are i groped about in five steps i came to an iron wall made of plates bolted together then turning back i struck against a wooden table near which were ranged several stools the boards of this prison were concealed under a thick mat which deadened the noise of the feet the bare walls revealed no trace of window or door conseil going round the reverse way met me and we went back to the middle of the cabin which measured about twenty feet by ten as to its height ned land in spite of his own great height could not measure it half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light our prison was suddenly lighted that is to say it became filled with a luminous matter so strong that i could not bear it at first in its whiteness and intensity i recognised that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence after shutting my eyes involuntarily i opened them and saw that this luminous agent came from a half globe unpolished placed in the roof of the cabin at last one can see cried ned land who knife in hand stood on the defensive yes said i but we are still in the dark about ourselves let master have patience said the imperturbable conseil the sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely it only contained a table and five stools the invisible door might be hermetically sealed no noise was heard all seemed dead in the interior of this boat did it move did it float on the surface of the ocean or did it dive into its depths i could not guess a noise of bolts was now heard the door opened and two men appeared one was short very muscular broadshouldered with robust limbs strong head an abundance of black hair thick moustache a quick penetrating look and the vivacity which characterises the population of southern france the second stranger merits a more detailed description i made out his prevailing qualities directly selfconfidencebecause his head was well set on his shoulders and his black eyes looked around with cold assurance calmnessfor his skin rather pale showed his coolness of blood energyevinced by the rapid contraction of his lofty brows and couragebecause his deep breathing denoted great power of lungs whether this person was thirtyfive or fifty years of age i could not say he was tall had a large forehead straight nose a clearly cut mouth beautiful teeth with fine taper hands indicative of a highly nervous temperament this man was certainly the most admirable specimen i had ever met one particular feature was his eyes rather far from each other and which could take in nearly a quarter of the horizon at once this facultyi verified it latergave him a range of vision far superior to ned lands when this stranger fixed upon an object his eyebrows met his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the range of his vision and he looked as if he magnified the objects lessened by distance as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and as if he read the very depths of the seas the two strangers with caps made from the fur of the sea otter and shod with sea boots of seals skin were dressed in clothes of a particular texture which allowed free movement of the limbs the taller of the two evidently the chief on board examined us with great attention without saying a word then turning to his companion talked with him in an unknown tongue it was a sonorous harmonious and flexible dialect the vowels seeming to admit of very varied accentuation the other replied by a shake of the head and added two or three perfectly incomprehensible words then he seemed to question me by a look i replied in good french that i did not know his language but he seemed not to understand me and my situation became more embarrassing if master were to tell our story said conseil perhaps these gentlemen may understand some words i began to tell our adventures articulating each syllable clearly and without omitting one single detail i announced our names and rank introducing in person professor aronnax his servant conseil and master ned land the harpooner the man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly even politely and with extreme attention but nothing in his countenance indicated that he had understood my story when i finished he said not a word there remained one resource to speak english perhaps they would know this almost universal language i knew itas well as the german languagewell enough to read it fluently but not to speak it correctly but anyhow we must make ourselves understood go on in your turn i said to the harpooner speak your best anglosaxon and try to do better than i ned did not beg off and recommenced our story to his great disgust the harpooner did not seem to have made himself more intelligible than i had our visitors did not stir they evidently understood neither the language of england nor of france very much embarrassed after having vainly exhausted our speaking resources i knew not what part to take when conseil said if master will permit me i will relate it in german but in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator the german language had no success at last nonplussed i tried to remember my first lessons and to narrate our adventures in latin but with no better success this last attempt being of no avail the two strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language and retired the door shut it is an infamous shame cried ned land who broke out for the twentieth time we speak to those rogues in french english german and latin and not one of them has the politeness to answer calm yourself i said to the impetuous ned anger will do no good but do you see professor replied our irascible companion that we shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage bah said conseil philosophically we can hold out some time yet my friends i said we must not despair we have been worse off than this do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion upon the commander and crew of this boat my opinion is formed replied ned land sharply they are rascals good and from what country from the land of rogues my brave ned that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the world but i admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to determine neither english french nor german that is quite certain however i am inclined to think that the commander and his companion were born in low latitudes there is southern blood in them but i cannot decide by their appearance whether they are spaniards turks arabians or indians as to their language it is quite incomprehensible there is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages said conseil or the disadvantage of not having one universal language as he said these words the door opened a steward entered he brought us clothes coats and trousers made of a stuff i did not know i hastened to dress myself and my companions followed my example during that time the stewarddumb perhaps deafhad arranged the table and laid three plates this is something like said conseil bah said the angry harpooner what do you suppose they eat here tortoise liver filleted shark and beef steaks from seadogs we shall see said conseil the dishes of bell metal were placed on the table and we took our places undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people and had it not been for the electric light which flooded us i could have fancied i was in the diningroom of the adelphi hotel at liverpool or at the grand hotel in paris i must say however that there was neither bread nor wine the water was fresh and clear but it was water and did not suit ned lands taste amongst the dishes which were brought to us i recognised several fish delicately dressed but of some although excellent i could give no opinion neither could i tell to what kingdom they belonged whether animal or vegetable as to the dinnerservice it was elegant and in perfect taste each utensilspoon fork knife platehad a letter engraved on it with a motto above it of which this is an exact facsimile mobilis in mobili n the letter n was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who commanded at the bottom of the seas ned and conseil did not reflect much they devoured the food and i did likewise i was besides reassured as to our fate and it seemed evident that our hosts would not let us die of want however everything has an end everything passes away even the hunger of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours our appetites satisfied we felt overcome with sleep faith i shall sleep well said conseil so shall i replied ned land my two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet and were soon sound asleep for my own part too many thoughts crowded my brain too many insoluble questions pressed upon me too many fancies kept my eyes half open where were we what strange power carried us on i feltor rather fancied i feltthe machine sinking down to the lowest beds of the sea dreadful nightmares beset me i saw in these mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals amongst which this submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind living moving and formidable as they then my brain grew calmer my imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness and i soon fell into a deep sleep ned lands tempers how long we slept i do not know but our sleep must have lasted long for it rested us completely from our fatigues i woke first my companions had not moved and were still stretched in their corner hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch i felt my brain freed my mind clear i then began an attentive examination of our cell nothing was changed inside the prison was still a prisonthe prisoners prisoners however the steward during our sleep had cleared the table i breathed with difficulty the heavy air seemed to oppress my lungs although the cell was large we had evidently consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained indeed each man consumes in one hour the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints of air and this air charged as then with a nearly equal quantity of carbonic acid becomes unbreathable it became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison and no doubt the whole in the submarine boat that gave rise to a question in my mind how would the commander of this floating dwellingplace proceed would he obtain air by chemical means in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash ora more convenient economical and consequently more probable alternativewould he be satisfied to rise and take breath at the surface of the water like a whale and so renew for twentyfour hours the atmospheric provision in fact i was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out of this cell the little oxygen it contained when suddenly i was refreshed by a current of pure air and perfumed with saline emanations it was an invigorating sea breeze charged with iodine i opened my mouth wide and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh particles at the same time i felt the boat rolling the ironplated monster had evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe after the fashion of whales i found out from that the mode of ventilating the boat when i had inhaled this air freely i sought the conduit pipe which conveyed to us the beneficial whiff and i was not long in finding it above the door was a ventilator through which volumes of fresh air renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell i was making my observations when ned and conseil awoke almost at the same time under the influence of this reviving air they rubbed their eyes stretched themselves and were on their feet in an instant did master sleep well asked conseil with his usual politeness very well my brave boy and you mr land soundly professor but i dont know if i am right or not there seems to be a sea breeze a seaman could not be mistaken and i told the canadian all that had passed during his sleep good said he that accounts for those roarings we heard when the supposed narwhal sighted the abraham lincoln quite so master land it was taking breath only mr aronnax i have no idea what oclock it is unless it is dinnertime dinnertime my good fellow say rather breakfasttime for we certainly have begun another day so said conseil we have slept twentyfour hours that is my opinion i will not contradict you replied ned land but dinner or breakfast the steward will be welcome whichever he brings master land we must conform to the rules on board and i suppose our appetites are in advance of the dinner hour that is just like you friend conseil said ned impatiently you are never out of temper always calm you would return thanks before grace and die of hunger rather than complain time was getting on and we were fearfully hungry and this time the steward did not appear it was rather too long to leave us if they really had good intentions towards us ned land tormented by the cravings of hunger got still more angry and notwithstanding his promise i dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the crew for two hours more ned lands temper increased he cried he shouted but in vain the walls were deaf there was no sound to be heard in the boat all was still as death it did not move for i should have felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw plunged in the depths of the waters it belonged no longer to earth this silence was dreadful i felt terrified conseil was calm ned land roared just then a noise was heard outside steps sounded on the metal flags the locks were turned the door opened and the steward appeared before i could rush forward to stop him the canadian had thrown him down and held him by the throat the steward was choking under the grip of his powerful hand conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooners hand from his halfsuffocated victim and i was going to fly to the rescue when suddenly i was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in french be quiet master land and you professor will you be so good as to listen to me the man of the seas it was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke at these words ned land rose suddenly the steward nearly strangled tottered out on a sign from his master but such was the power of the commander on board that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the canadian conseil interested in spite of himself i stupefied awaited in silence the result of this scene the commander leaning against the corner of a table with his arms folded scanned us with profound attention did he hesitate to speak did he regret the words which he had just spoken in french one might almost think so after some moments of silence which not one of us dreamed of breaking gentlemen said he in a calm and penetrating voice i speak french english german and latin equally well i could therefore have answered you at our first interview but i wished to know you first then to reflect the story told by each one entirely agreeing in the main points convinced me of your identity i know now that chance has brought before me m pierre aronnax professor of natural history at the museum of paris entrusted with a scientific mission abroad conseil his servant and ned land of canadian origin harpooner on board the frigate abraham lincoln of the navy of the united states of america i bowed assent it was not a question that the commander put to me therefore there was no answer to be made this man expressed himself with perfect ease without any accent his sentences were well turned his words clear and his fluency of speech remarkable yet i did not recognise in him a fellowcountryman he continued the conversation in these terms you have doubtless thought sir that i have delayed long in paying you this second visit the reason is that your identity recognised i wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you i have hesitated much most annoying circumstances have brought you into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity you have come to trouble my existence unintentionally said i unintentionally replied the stranger raising his voice a little was it unintentionally that the abraham lincoln pursued me all over the seas was it unintentionally that you took passage in this frigate was it unintentionally that your cannonballs rebounded off the plating of my vessel was it unintentionally that mr ned land struck me with his harpoon i detected a restrained irritation in these words but to these recriminations i had a very natural answer to make and i made it sir said i no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning you in america and europe you do not know that divers accidents caused by collisions with your submarine machine have excited public feeling in the two continents i omit the theories without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you alone possess the secret but you must understand that in pursuing you over the high seas of the pacific the abraham lincoln believed itself to be chasing some powerful seamonster of which it was necessary to rid the ocean at any price a halfsmile curled the lips of the commander then in a calmer tone m aronnax he replied dare you affirm that your frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster this question embarrassed me for certainly captain farragut might not have hesitated he might have thought it his duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind as he would a gigantic narwhal you understand then sir continued the stranger that i have the right to treat you as enemies i answered nothing purposely for what good would it be to discuss such a proposition when force could destroy the best arguments i have hesitated some time continued the commander nothing obliged me to show you hospitality if i chose to separate myself from you i should have no interest in seeing you again i could place you upon the deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge i could sink beneath the waters and forget that you had ever existed would not that be my right it might be the right of a savage i answered but not that of a civilised man professor replied the commander quickly i am not what you call a civilised man i have done with society entirely for reasons which i alone have the right of appreciating i do not therefore obey its laws and i desire you never to allude to them before me again this was said plainly a flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of the unknown and i had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of this man not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human laws but he had made himself independent of them free in the strictest acceptation of the word quite beyond their reach who then would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea when on its surface he defied all attempts made against him what vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor what cuirass however thick could withstand the blows of his spur no man could demand from him an account of his actions god if he believed in onehis conscience if he had onewere the sole judges to whom he was answerable these reflections crossed my mind rapidly whilst the stranger personage was silent absorbed and as if wrapped up in himself i regarded him with fear mingled with interest as doubtless oediphus regarded the sphinx after rather a long silence the commander resumed the conversation i have hesitated said he but i have thought that my interest might be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right you will remain on board my vessel since fate has cast you there you will be free and in exchange for this liberty i shall only impose one single condition your word of honour to submit to it will suffice speak sir i answered i suppose this condition is one which a man of honour may accept yes sir it is this it is possible that certain events unforeseen may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some days as the case may be as i desire never to use violence i expect from you more than all the others a passive obedience in thus acting i take all the responsibility i acquit you entirely for i make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen do you accept this condition then things took place on board which to say the least were singular and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the pale of social laws amongst the surprises which the future was preparing for me this might not be the least we accept i answered only i will ask your permission sir to address one question to youone only speak sir you said that we should be free on board entirely i ask you then what you mean by this liberty just the liberty to go to come to see to observe even all that passes here save under rare circumstancesthe liberty in short which we enjoy ourselves my companions and i it was evident that we did not understand one another pardon me sir i resumed but this liberty is only what every prisoner has of pacing his prison it cannot suffice us it must suffice you however what we must renounce for ever seeing our country our friends our relations again yes sir but to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think well exclaimed ned land never will i give my word of honour not to try to escape i did not ask you for your word of honour master land answered the commander coldly sir i replied beginning to get angry in spite of my self you abuse your situation towards us it is cruelty no sir it is clemency you are my prisoners of war i keep you when i could by a word plunge you into the depths of the ocean you attacked me you came to surprise a secret which no man in the world must penetratethe secret of my whole existence and you think that i am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more never in retaining you it is not you whom i guardit is myself these words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander against which no arguments would prevail so sir i rejoined you give us simply the choice between life and death simply my friends said i to a question thus put there is nothing to answer but no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel none sir answered the unknown then in a gentler tone he continued now permit me to finish what i have to say to you i know you m aronnax you and your companions will not perhaps have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate you will find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you have published on the depths of the sea i have often read it you have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you but you do not know allyou have not seen all let me tell you then professor that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel you are going to visit the land of marvels these words of the commander had a great effect upon me i cannot deny it my weak point was touched and i forgot for a moment that the contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of liberty besides i trusted to the future to decide this grave question so i contented myself with saying by what name ought i to address you sir replied the commander i am nothing to you but captain nemo and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the nautilus captain nemo called a steward appeared the captain gave him his orders in that strange language which i did not understand then turning towards the canadian and conseil a repast awaits you in your cabin said he be so good as to follow this man and now m aronnax our breakfast is ready permit me to lead the way i am at your service captain i followed captain nemo and as soon as i had passed through the door i found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity similar to the waist of a ship after we had proceeded a dozen yards a second door opened before me i then entered a diningroom decorated and furnished in severe taste high oaken sideboards inlaid with ebony stood at the two extremities of the room and upon their shelves glittered china porcelain and glass of inestimable value the plate on the table sparkled in the rays which the luminous ceiling shed around while the light was tempered and softened by exquisite paintings in the centre of the room was a table richly laid out captain nemo indicated the place i was to occupy the breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone and i was ignorant of the nature and mode of preparation of some of them i acknowledged that they were good but they had a peculiar flavour which i easily became accustomed to these different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus and i thought they must have a marine origin captain nemo looked at me i asked him no questions but he guessed my thoughts and answered of his own accord the questions which i was burning to address to him the greater part of these dishes are unknown to you he said to me however you may partake of them without fear they are wholesome and nourishing for a long time i have renounced the food of the earth and i am never ill now my crew who are healthy are fed on the same food so said i all these eatables are the produce of the sea yes professor the sea supplies all my wants sometimes i cast my nets in tow and i draw them in ready to break sometimes i hunt in the midst of this element which appears to be inaccessible to man and quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests my flocks like those of neptunes old shepherds graze fearlessly in the immense prairies of the ocean i have a vast property there which i cultivate myself and which is always sown by the hand of the creator of all things i can understand perfectly sir that your nets furnish excellent fish for your table i can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in your submarine forests but i cannot understand at all how a particle of meat no matter how small can figure in your bill of fare this which you believe to be meat professor is nothing else than fillet of turtle here are also some dolphins livers which you take to be ragout of pork my cook is a clever fellow who excels in dressing these various products of the ocean taste all these dishes here is a preserve of seacucumber which a malay would declare to be unrivalled in the world here is a cream of which the milk has been furnished by the cetacea and the sugar by the great fucus of the north sea and lastly permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits i tasted more from curiosity than as a connoisseur whilst captain nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories you like the sea captain yes i love it the sea is everything it covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe its breath is pure and healthy it is an immense desert where man is never lonely for he feels life stirring on all sides the sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence it is nothing but love and emotion it is the living infinite as one of your poets has said in fact professor nature manifests herself in it by her three kingdomsmineral vegetable and animal the sea is the vast reservoir of nature the globe began with sea so to speak and who knows if it will not end with it in it is supreme tranquillity the sea does not belong to despots upon its surface men can still exercise unjust laws fight tear one another to pieces and be carried away with terrestrial horrors but at thirty feet below its level their reign ceases their influence is quenched and their power disappears ah sir livelive in the bosom of the waters there only is independence there i recognise no masters there i am free captain nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm by which he was quite carried away for a few moments he paced up and down much agitated then he became more calm regained his accustomed coldness of expression and turning towards me now professor said he if you wish to go over the nautilus i am at your service captain nemo rose i followed him a double door contrived at the back of the diningroom opened and i entered a room equal in dimensions to that which i had just quitted it was a library high pieces of furniture of black violet ebony inlaid with brass supported upon their wide shelves a great number of books uniformly bound they followed the shape of the room terminating at the lower part in huge divans covered with brown leather which were curved to afford the greatest comfort light movable desks made to slide in and out at will allowed one to rest ones book while reading in the centre stood an immense table covered with pamphlets amongst which were some newspapers already of old date the electric light flooded everything it was shed from four unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling i looked with real admiration at this room so ingeniously fitted up and i could scarcely believe my eyes captain nemo said i to my host who had just thrown himself on one of the divans this is a library which would do honour to more than one of the continental palaces and i am absolutely astounded when i consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas where could one find greater solitude or silence professor replied captain nemo did your study in the museum afford you such perfect quiet no sir and i must confess that it is a very poor one after yours you must have six or seven thousand volumes here twelve thousand m aronnax these are the only ties which bind me to the earth but i had done with the world on the day when my nautilus plunged for the first time beneath the waters that day i bought my last volumes my last pamphlets my last papers and from that time i wish to think that men no longer think or write these books professor are at your service besides and you can make use of them freely i thanked captain nemo and went up to the shelves of the library works on science morals and literature abounded in every language but i did not see one single work on political economy that subject appeared to be strictly proscribed strange to say all these books were irregularly arranged in whatever language they were written and this medley proved that the captain of the nautilus must have read indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance sir said i to the captain i thank you for having placed this library at my disposal it contains treasures of science and i shall profit by them this room is not only a library said captain nemo it is also a smokingroom a smokingroom i cried then one may smoke on board certainly then sir i am forced to believe that you have kept up a communication with havannah not any answered the captain accept this cigar m aronnax and though it does not come from havannah you will be pleased with it if you are a connoisseur i took the cigar which was offered me its shape recalled the london ones but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold i lighted it at a little brazier which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem and drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has not smoked for two days it is excellent but it is not tobacco no answered the captain this tobacco comes neither from havannah nor from the east it is a kind of seaweed rich in nicotine with which the sea provides me but somewhat sparingly at that moment captain nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that by which i had entered the library and i passed into an immense drawingroom splendidly lighted it was a vast foursided room thirty feet long eighteen wide and fifteen high a luminous ceiling decorated with light arabesques shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this museum for it was in fact a museum in which an intelligent and prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art with the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painters studio thirty firstrate pictures uniformly framed separated by bright drapery ornamented the walls which were hung with tapestry of severe design i saw works of great value the greater part of which i had admired in the special collections of europe and in the exhibitions of paintings the several schools of the old masters were represented by a madonna of raphael a virgin of leonardo da vinci a nymph of corregio a woman of titan an adoration of veronese an assumption of murillo a portrait of holbein a monk of velasquez a martyr of ribera a fair of rubens two flemish landscapes of teniers three little genre pictures of gerard dow metsu and paul potter two specimens of gericault and prudhon and some seapieces of backhuysen and vernet amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures of delacroix ingres decamps troyon meissonier daubigny etc and some admirable statues in marble and bronze after the finest antique models stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum amazement as the captain of the nautilus had predicted had already begun to take possession of me professor said this strange man you must excuse the unceremonious way in which i receive you and the disorder of this room sir i answered without seeking to know who you are i recognise in you an artist an amateur nothing more sir formerly i loved to collect these beautiful works created by the hand of man i sought them greedily and ferreted them out indefatigably and i have been able to bring together some objects of great value these are my last souvenirs of that world which is dead to me in my eyes your modern artists are already old they have two or three thousand years of existence i confound them in my own mind masters have no age and these musicians said i pointing out some works of weber rossini mozart beethoven haydn meyerbeer herold wagner auber gounod and a number of others scattered over a large model pianoorgan which occupied one of the panels of the drawingroom these musicians replied captain nemo are the contemporaries of orpheus for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences are effaced and i am dead professor as much dead as those of your friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth captain nemo was silent and seemed lost in a profound reverie i contemplated him with deep interest analysing in silence the strange expression of his countenance leaning on his elbow against an angle of a costly mosaic table he no longer saw mehe had forgotten my presence i did not disturb this reverie and continued my observation of the curiosities which enriched this drawingroom under elegant glass cases fixed by copper rivets were classed and labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been presented to the eye of a naturalist my delight as a professor may be conceived the division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes in the first group the tubipores were gorgones arranged like a fan soft sponges of syria ises of the moluccas pennatules an admirable virgularia of the norwegian seas variegated unbellulairae alcyonariae a whole series of madrepores which my master milne edwards has so cleverly classified amongst which i remarked some wonderful flabellinae oculinae of the island of bourbon the neptunes car of the antilles superb varieties of coralsin short every species of those curious polypi of which entire islands are formed which will one day become continents of the echinodermes remarkable for their coating of spines asteri seastars pantacrinae comatules asterophons echini holothuri etc represented individually a complete collection of this group a somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before other more numerous cases in which were classified the specimens of molluscs it was a collection of inestimable value which time fails me to describe minutely amongst these specimens i will quote from memory only the elegant royal hammerfish of the indian ocean whose regular white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground an imperial spondyle brightcoloured bristling with spines a rare specimen in the european museumsi estimated its value at not less than l1000 a common hammerfish of the seas of new holland which is only procured with difficulty exotic buccardia of senegal fragile white bivalve shells which a breath might shatter like a soapbubble several varieties of the aspirgillum of java a kind of calcareous tube edged with leafy folds and much debated by amateurs a whole series of trochi some a greenishyellow found in the american seas others a reddishbrown natives of australian waters others from the gulf of mexico remarkable for their imbricated shell stellari found in the southern seas and last the rarest of all the magnificent spur of new zealand and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which science has given appropriate names apart in separate compartments were spread out chaplets of pearls of the greatest beauty which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire pink pearls torn from the pinnamarina of the red sea green pearls of the haliotyde iris yellow blue and black pearls the curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean and certain mussels of the watercourses of the north lastly several specimens of inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines some of these pearls were larger than a pigeons egg and were worth as much and more than that which the traveller tavernier sold to the shah of persia for three millions and surpassed the one in the possession of the imaum of muscat which i had believed to be unrivalled in the world therefore to estimate the value of this collection was simply impossible captain nemo must have expended millions in the acquirement of these various specimens and i was thinking what source he could have drawn from to have been able thus to gratify his fancy for collecting when i was interrupted by these words you are examining my shells professor unquestionably they must be interesting to a naturalist but for me they have a far greater charm for i have collected them all with my own hand and there is not a sea on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches i can understand captain the delight of wandering about in the midst of such riches you are one of those who have collected their treasures themselves no museum in europe possesses such a collection of the produce of the ocean but if i exhaust all my admiration upon it i shall have none left for the vessel which carries it i do not wish to pry into your secrets but i must confess that this nautilus with the motive power which is confined in it the contrivances which enable it to be worked the powerful agent which propels it all excite my curiosity to the highest pitch i see suspended on the walls of this room instruments of whose use i am ignorant you will find these same instruments in my own room professor where i shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you but first come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use you must see how you will be accommodated on board the nautilus i followed captain nemo who by one of the doors opening from each panel of the drawingroom regained the waist he conducted me towards the bow and there i found not a cabin but an elegant room with a bed dressingtable and several other pieces of excellent furniture i could only thank my host your room adjoins mine said he opening a door and mine opens into the drawingroom that we have just quitted i entered the captains room it had a severe almost a monkish aspect a small iron bedstead a table some articles for the toilet the whole lighted by a skylight no comforts the strictest necessaries only captain nemo pointed to a seat be so good as to sit down he said i seated myself and he began thus all by electricity sir said captain nemo showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his room here are the contrivances required for the navigation of the nautilus here as in the drawingroom i have them always under my eyes and they indicate my position and exact direction in the middle of the ocean some are known to you such as the thermometer which gives the internal temperature of the nautilus the barometer which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the changes of the weather the hygrometer which marks the dryness of the atmosphere the stormglass the contents of which by decomposing announce the approach of tempests the compass which guides my course the sextant which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun chronometers by which i calculate the longitude and glasses for day and night which i use to examine the points of the horizon when the nautilus rises to the surface of the waves these are the usual nautical instruments i replied and i know the use of them but these others no doubt answer to the particular requirements of the nautilus this dial with movable needle is a manometer is it not it is actually a manometer but by communication with the water whose external pressure it indicates it gives our depth at the same time and these other instruments the use of which i cannot guess here professor i ought to give you some explanations will you be kind enough to listen to me he was silent for a few moments then he said there is a powerful agent obedient rapid easy which conforms to every use and reigns supreme on board my vessel everything is done by means of it it lights warms it and is the soul of my mechanical apparatus this agent is electricity electricity i cried in surprise yes sir nevertheless captain you possess an extreme rapidity of movement which does not agree well with the power of electricity until now its dynamic force has remained under restraint and has only been able to produce a small amount of power professor said captain nemo my electricity is not everybodys you know what seawater is composed of in a thousand grammes are found 96 12 per cent of water and about 2 23 per cent of chloride of sodium then in a smaller quantity chlorides of magnesium and of potassium bromide of magnesium sulphate of magnesia sulphate and carbonate of lime you see then that chloride of sodium forms a large part of it so it is this sodium that i extract from the seawater and of which i compose my ingredients i owe all to the ocean it produces electricity and electricity gives heat light motion and in a word life to the nautilus but not the air you breathe oh i could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption but it is useless because i go up to the surface of the water when i please however if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe it works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious reservoirs and which enable me to prolong at need and as long as i will my stay in the depths of the sea it gives a uniform and unintermittent light which the sun does not now look at this clock it is electrical and goes with a regularity that defies the best chronometers i have divided it into twentyfour hours like the italian clocks because for me there is neither night nor day sun nor moon but only that factitious light that i take with me to the bottom of the sea look just now it is ten oclock in the morning exactly another application of electricity this dial hanging in front of us indicates the speed of the nautilus an electric thread puts it in communication with the screw and the needle indicates the real speed look now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles an hour it is marvelous and i see captain you were right to make use of this agent that takes the place of wind water and steam we have not finished m aronnax said captain nemo rising if you will allow me we will examine the stern of the nautilus really i knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat of which this is the exact division starting from the ships head the diningroom five yards long separated from the library by a watertight partition the library five yards long the large drawingroom ten yards long separated from the captains room by a second watertight partition the said room five yards in length mine two and a half yards and lastly a reservoir of air seven and a half yards that extended to the bows total length thirty five yards or one hundred and five feet the partitions had doors that were shut hermetically by means of indiarubber instruments and they ensured the safety of the nautilus in case of a leak i followed captain nemo through the waist and arrived at the centre of the boat there was a sort of well that opened between two partitions an iron ladder fastened with an iron hook to the partition led to the upper end i asked the captain what the ladder was used for it leads to the small boat he said what have you a boat i exclaimed in surprise of course an excellent vessel light and insubmersible that serves either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat but then when you wish to embark you are obliged to come to the surface of the water not at all this boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of the nautilus and occupies a cavity made for it it is decked quite watertight and held together by solid bolts this ladder leads to a manhole made in the hull of the nautilus that corresponds with a similar hole made in the side of the boat by this double opening i get into the small vessel they shut the one belonging to the nautilus i shut the other by means of screw pressure i undo the bolts and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity i then open the panel of the bridge carefully shut till then i mast it hoist my sail take my oars and im off but how do you get back on board i do not come back m aronnax the nautilus comes to me by your orders by my orders an electric thread connects us i telegraph to it and that is enough really i said astonished at these marvels nothing can be more simple after having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the platform i saw a cabin six feet long in which conseil and ned land enchanted with their repast were devouring it with avidity then a door opened into a kitchen nine feet long situated between the large storerooms there electricity better than gas itself did all the cooking the streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed they also heated a distilling apparatus which by evaporation furnished excellent drinkable water near this kitchen was a bathroom comfortably furnished with hot and cold water taps next to the kitchen was the berthroom of the vessel sixteen feet long but the door was shut and i could not see the management of it which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on board the nautilus at the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from the engineroom a door opened and i found myself in the compartment where captain nemocertainly an engineer of a very high orderhad arranged his locomotive machinery this engineroom clearly lighted did not measure less than sixtyfive feet in length it was divided into two parts the first contained the materials for producing electricity and the second the machinery that connected it with the screw i examined it with great interest in order to understand the machinery of the nautilus you see said the captain i use bunsens contrivances not ruhmkorffs those would not have been powerful enough bunsens are fewer in number but strong and large which experience proves to be the best the electricity produced passes forward where it works by electromagnets of great size on a system of levers and cogwheels that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw this one the diameter of which is nineteen feet and the thread twentythree feet performs about 120 revolutions in a second and you get then a speed of fifty miles an hour i have seen the nautilus manoeuvre before the abraham lincoln and i have my own ideas as to its speed but this is not enough we must see where we go we must be able to direct it to the right to the left above below how do you get to the great depths where you find an increasing resistance which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres how do you return to the surface of the ocean and how do you maintain yourselves in the requisite medium am i asking too much not at all professor replied the captain with some hesitation since you may never leave this submarine boat come into the saloon it is our usual study and there you will learn all you want to know about the nautilus some figures a moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking the captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan section and elevation of the nautilus then he began his description in these words here m aronnax are the several dimensions of the boat you are in it is an elongated cylinder with conical ends it is very like a cigar in shape a shape already adopted in london in several constructions of the same sort the length of this cylinder from stem to stern is exactly 232 feet and its maximum breadth is twentysix feet it is not built quite like your longvoyage steamers but its lines are sufficiently long and its curves prolonged enough to allow the water to slide off easily and oppose no obstacle to its passage these two dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and cubic contents of the nautilus its area measures 6032 feet and its contents about 1500 cubic yards that is to say when completely immersed it displaces 50000 feet of water or weighs 1500 tons when i made the plans for this submarine vessel i meant that ninetenths should be submerged consequently it ought only to displace ninetenths of its bulk that is to say only to weigh that number of tons i ought not therefore to have exceeded that weight constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions the nautilus is composed of two hulls one inside the other outside joined by tshaped irons which render it very strong indeed owing to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block as if it were solid its sides cannot yield it coheres spontaneously and not by the closeness of its rivets and its perfect union of the materials enables it to defy the roughest seas these two hulls are composed of steel plates whose density is from 7 to 8 that of water the first is not less than two inches and a half thick and weighs 394 tons the second envelope the keel twenty inches high and ten thick weighs only sixtytwo tons the engine the ballast the several accessories and apparatus appendages the partitions and bulkheads weigh 96162 tons do you follow all this i do then when the nautilus is afloat under these circumstances onetenth is out of the water now if i have made reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth or capable of holding 150 tons and if i fill them with water the boat weighing then 1507 tons will be completely immersed that would happen professor these reservoirs are in the lower part of the nautilus i turn on taps and they fill and the vessel sinks that had just been level with the surface well captain but now we come to the real difficulty i can understand your rising to the surface but diving below the surface does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure and consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every thirty feet of water just about fifteen pounds per square inch just so sir then unless you quite fill the nautilus i do not see how you can draw it down to those depths professor you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be exposed to grave errors there is very little labour spent in attaining the lower regions of the ocean for all bodies have a tendency to sink when i wanted to find out the necessary increase of weight required to sink the nautilus i had only to calculate the reduction of volume that seawater acquires according to the depth that is evident now if water is not absolutely incompressible it is at least capable of very slight compression indeed after the most recent calculations this reduction is only 000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of depth if we want to sink 3000 feet i should keep account of the reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water of a thousand feet the calculation is easily verified now i have supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons therefore i can sink to a considerable depth when i wish to rise to the level of the sea i only let off the water and empty all the reservoirs if i want the nautilus to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity i had nothing to object to these reasonings i admit your calculations captain i replied i should be wrong to dispute them since daily experience confirms them but i foresee a real difficulty in the way what sir when you are about 1000 feet deep the walls of the nautilus bear a pressure of 100 atmospheres if then just now you were to empty the supplementary reservoirs to lighten the vessel and to go up to the surface the pumps must overcome the pressure of 100 atmospheres which is 1500 lbs per square inch from that a power that electricity alone can give said the captain hastily i repeat sir that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite the pumps of the nautilus have an enormous power as you must have observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the abraham lincoln besides i use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean depth of 750 to 1000 fathoms and that with a view of managing my machines also when i have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean five or six mlles below the surface i make use of slower but not less infallible means what are they captain that involves my telling you how the nautilus is worked i am impatient to learn to steer this boat to starboard or port to turn in a word following a horizontal plan i use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the sternpost and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by but i can also make the nautilus rise and sink and sink and rise by a vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides opposite the centre of flotation planes that move in every direction and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior if the planes are kept parallel with the boat it moves horizontally if slanted the nautilus according to this inclination and under the influence of the screw either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as it suits me and even if i wish to rise more quickly to the surface i ship the screw and the pressure of the water causes the nautilus to rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen bravo captain but how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters the steersman is placed in a glazed box that is raised about the hull of the nautilus and furnished with lenses are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure perfectly glass which breaks at a blow is nevertheless capable of offering considerable resistance during some experiments of fishing by electric light in 1864 in the northern seas we saw plates less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres now the glass that i use is not less than thirty times thicker granted but after all in order to see the light must exceed the darkness and in the midst of the darkness in the water how can you see behind the steersmans cage is placed a powerful electric reflector the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front ah bravo bravo captain now i can account for this phosphorescence in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so i now ask you if the boarding of the nautilus and of the scotia that has made such a noise has been the result of a chance rencontre quite accidental sir i was sailing only one fathom below the surface of the water when the shock came it had no bad result none sir but now about your rencontre with the abraham lincoln professor i am sorry for one of the best vessels in the american navy but they attacked me and i was bound to defend myself i contented myself however with putting the frigate hors de combat she will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port ah commander your nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat yes professor and i love it as if it were part of myself if danger threatens one of your vessels on the ocean the first impression is the feeling of an abyss above and below on the nautilus mens hearts never fail them no defects to be afraid of for the double shell is as firm as iron no rigging to attend to no sails for the wind to carry away no boilers to burst no fire to fear for the vessel is made of iron not of wood no coal to run short for electricity is the only mechanical agent no collision to fear for it alone swims in deep water no tempest to brave for when it dives below the water it reaches absolute tranquillity there sir that is the perfection of vessels and if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the vessel than the builder and the builder than the captain himself you understand the trust i repose in my nautilus for i am at once captain builder and engineer but how could you construct this wonderful nautilus in secret each separate portion m aronnax was brought from different parts of the globe but these parts had to be put together and arranged professor i had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the ocean there my workmen that is to say the brave men that i instructed and educated and myself have put together our nautilus then when the work was finished fire destroyed all trace of our proceedings on this island that i could have jumped over if i had liked then the cost of this vessel is great m aronnax an iron vessel costs l145 per ton now the nautilus weighed 1500 it came therefore to l67500 and l80000 more for fitting it up and about l200000 with the works of art and the collections it contains one last question captain nemo ask it professor you are rich immensely rich sir and i could without missing it pay the national debt of france i stared at the singular person who spoke thus was he playing upon my credulity the future would decide that the black river the portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres this fluid mass comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues the weight of which would be three quintillions of tons to comprehend the meaning of these figures it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a billion as a billion is to unity in other words there are as many billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion this mass of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years during the geological epochs the ocean originally prevailed everywhere then by degrees in the silurian period the tops of the mountains began to appear the islands emerged then disappeared in partial deluges reappeared became settled formed continents till at length the earth became geographically arranged as we see in the present day the solid had wrested from the liquid thirtyseven million six hundred and fiftyseven square miles equal to twelve billions nine hundred and sixty millions of acres the shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great portions the arctic or frozen ocean the antarctic or frozen ocean the indian the atlantic and the pacific oceans the pacific ocean extends from north to south between the two polar circles and from east to west between asia and america over an extent of 145 degrees of longitude it is the quietest of seas its currents are broad and slow it has medium tides and abundant rain such was the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these strange conditions sir said captain nemo we will if you please take our bearings and fix the startingpoint of this voyage it is a quarter to twelve i will go up again to the surface the captain pressed an electric clock three times the pumps began to drive the water from the tanks the needle of the manometer marked by a different pressure the ascent of the nautilus then it stopped we have arrived said the captain i went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform clambered up the iron steps and found myself on the upper part of the nautilus the platform was only three feet out of water the front and back of the nautilus was of that spindleshape which caused it justly to be compared to a cigar i noticed that its iron plates slightly overlaying each other resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of our large terrestrial reptiles it explained to me how natural it was in spite of all glasses that this boat should have been taken for a marine animal toward the middle of the platform the longboat half buried in the hull of the vessel formed a slight excrescence fore and aft rose two cages of medium height with inclined sides and partly closed by thick lenticular glasses one destined for the steersman who directed the nautilus the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the road the sea was beautiful the sky pure scarcely could the long vehicle feel the broad undulations of the ocean a light breeze from the east rippled the surface of the waters the horizon free from fog made observation easy nothing was in sight not a quicksand not an island a vast desert captain nemo by the help of his sextant took the altitude of the sun which ought also to give the latitude he waited for some moments till its disc touched the horizon whilst taking observations not a muscle moved the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of marble twelve oclock sir said he when you like i cast a last look upon the sea slightly yellowed by the japanese coast and descended to the saloon and now sir i leave you to your studies added the captain our course is ene our depth is twentysix fathoms here are maps on a large scale by which you may follow it the saloon is at your disposal and with your permission i will retire captain nemo bowed and i remained alone lost in thoughts all bearing on the commander of the nautilus for a whole hour was i deep in these reflections seeking to pierce this mystery so interesting to me then my eyes fell upon the vast planisphere spread upon the table and i placed my finger on the very spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed the sea has its large rivers like the continents they are special currents known by their temperature and their colour the most remarkable of these is known by the name of the gulf stream science has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents one in the north atlantic a second in the south a third in the north pacific a fourth in the south and a fifth in the southern indian ocean it is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or another in the northern indian ocean when the caspian and aral seas formed but one vast sheet of water at this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was rolling the kuroscivo of the japanese the black river which leaving the gulf of bengal where it is warmed by the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun crosses the straits of malacca along the coast of asia turns into the north pacific to the aleutian islands carrying with it trunks of camphortrees and other indigenous productions and edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water it was this current that the nautilus was to follow i followed it with my eye saw it lose itself in the vastness of the pacific and felt myself drawn with it when ned land and conseil appeared at the door of the saloon my two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders spread before them where are we where are we exclaimed the canadian in the museum at quebec my friends i answered making a sign for them to enter you are not in canada but on board the nautilus fifty yards below the level of the sea but m aronnax said ned land can you tell me how many men there are on board ten twenty fifty a hundred i cannot answer you mr land it is better to abandon for a time all idea of seizing the nautilus or escaping from it this ship is a masterpiece of modern industry and i should be sorry not to have seen it many people would accept the situation forced upon us if only to move amongst such wonders so be quiet and let us try and see what passes around us see exclaimed the harpooner but we can see nothing in this iron prison we are walkingwe are sailingblindly ned land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly darkness the luminous ceiling was gone and so rapidly that my eyes received a painful impression we remained mute not stirring and not knowing what surprise awaited us whether agreeable or disagreeable a sliding noise was heard one would have said that panels were working at the sides of the nautilus it is the end of the end said ned land suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon through two oblong openings the liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric gleam two crystal plates separated us from the sea at first i trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break but strong bands of copper bound them giving an almost infinite power of resistance the sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the nautilus what a spectacle what pen can describe it who could paint the effects of the light through those transparent sheets of water and the softness of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of the ocean we know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far beyond that of rockwater the mineral and organic substances which it holds in suspension heightens its transparency in certain parts of the ocean at the antilles under seventyfive fathoms of water can be seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand the penetrating power of the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and fifty fathoms but in this middle fluid travelled over by the nautilus the electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the waves it was no longer luminous water but liquid light on each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss the obscurity of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside and we looked out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium you wished to see friend ned well you see now curious curious muttered the canadian who forgetting his illtemper seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction and one would come further than this to admire such a sight ah thought i to myself i understand the life of this man he has made a world apart for himself in which he treasures all his greatest wonders for two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the nautilus during their games their bounds while rivalling each other in beauty brightness and velocity i distinguished the green labre the banded mullet marked by a double line of black the roundtailed goby of a white colour with violet spots on the back the japanese scombrus a beautiful mackerel of these seas with a blue body and silvery head the brilliant azurors whose name alone defies description some banded spares with variegated fins of blue and yellow the woodcocks of the seas some specimens of which attain a yard in length japanese salamanders spider lampreys serpents six feet long with eyes small and lively and a huge mouth bristling with teeth with many other species our imagination was kept at its height interjections followed quickly on each other ned named the fish and conseil classed them i was in ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their forms never had it been given to me to surprise these animals alive and at liberty in their natural element i will not mention all the varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes all the collection of the seas of china and japan these fish more numerous than the birds of the air came attracted no doubt by the brilliant focus of the electric light suddenly there was daylight in the saloon the iron panels closed again and the enchanting vision disappeared but for a long time i dreamt on till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the partition the compass still showed the course to be ene the manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres equivalent to a depth of twenty five fathoms and the electric log gave a speed of fifteen miles an hour i expected captain nemo but he did not appear the clock marked the hour of five ned land and conseil returned to their cabin and i retired to my chamber my dinner was ready it was composed of turtle soup made of the most delicate hawks bills of a surmullet served with puff paste the liver of which prepared by itself was most delicious and fillets of the emperorholocanthus the savour of which seemed to me superior even to salmon i passed the evening reading writing and thinking then sleep overpowered me and i stretched myself on my couch of zostera and slept profoundly whilst the nautilus was gliding rapidly through the current of the black river a note of invitation the next day was the 9th of november i awoke after a long sleep of twelve hours conseil came according to custom to know how i passed the night and to offer his services he had left his friend the canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all his life i let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased without caring to answer him i was preoccupied by the absence of the captain during our sitting of the day before and hoping to see him today as soon as i was dressed i went into the saloon it was deserted i plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses the whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from captain nemo the panels of the saloon did not open perhaps they did not wish us to tire of these beautiful things the course of the nautilus was ene her speed twelve knots the depth below the surface between twentyfive and thirty fathoms the next day 10th of november the same desertion the same solitude i did not see one of the ships crew ned and conseil spent the greater part of the day with me they were astonished at the puzzling absence of the captain was this singular man illhad he altered his intentions with regard to us after all as conseil said we enjoyed perfect liberty we were delicately and abundantly fed our host kept to his terms of the treaty we could not complain and indeed the singularity of our fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right to accuse it as yet that day i commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail 11th november early in the morning the fresh air spreading over the interior of the nautilus told me that we had come to the surface of the ocean to renew our supply of oxygen i directed my steps to the central staircase and mounted the platform it was six oclock the weather was cloudy the sea grey but calm scarcely a billow captain nemo whom i hoped to meet would he be there i saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace i inhaled the salt breeze with delight by degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the suns rays the radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon the sea flamed under its glance like a train of gunpowder the clouds scattered in the heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades and numerous mares tails which betokened wind for that day but what was wind to this nautilus which tempests could not frighten i was admiring this joyous rising of the sun so gay and so lifegiving when i heard steps approaching the platform i was prepared to salute captain nemo but it was his second whom i had already seen on the captains first visit who appeared he advanced on the platform not seeming to see me with his powerful glass to his eye he scanned every point of the horizon with great attention this examination over he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in exactly these terms i have remembered it for every morning it was repeated under exactly the same conditions it was thus worded nautron respoc lorni virch what it meant i could not say these words pronounced the second descended i thought that the nautilus was about to return to its submarine navigation i regained the panel and returned to my chamber five days sped thus without any change in our situation every morning i mounted the platform the same phrase was pronounced by the same individual but captain nemo did not appear i had made up my mind that i should never see him again when on the 16th november on returning to my room with ned and conseil i found upon my table a note addressed to me i opened it impatiently it was written in a bold clear hand the characters rather pointed recalling the german type the note was worded as follows to professor aronnax on board the nautilus 16th of november 1867 captain nemo invites professor aronnax to a huntingparty which will take place tomorrow morning in the forests of the island of crespo he hopes that nothing will prevent the professor from being present and he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions captain nemo commander of the nautilus a hunt exclaimed ned and in the forests of the island of crespo added conseil oh then the gentleman is going on terra firma replied ned land that seems to me to be clearly indicated said i reading the letter once more well we must accept said the canadian but once more on dry ground we shall know what to do indeed i shall not be sorry to eat a piece of fresh venison without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between captain nemos manifest aversion to islands and continents and his invitation to hunt in a forest i contented myself with replying let us first see where the island of crespo is i consulted the planisphere and in 32 deg 40 n lat and 157 deg 50 w long i found a small island recognised in 1801 by captain crespo and marked in the ancient spanish maps as rocca de la plata the meaning of which is the silver rock we were then about eighteen hundred miles from our startingpoint and the course of the nautilus a little changed was bringing it back towards the southeast i showed this little rock lost in the midst of the north pacific to my companions if captain nemo does sometimes go on dry ground said i he at least chooses desert islands ned land shrugged his shoulders without speaking and conseil and he left me after supper which was served by the steward mute and impassive i went to bed not without some anxiety the next morning the 17th of november on awakening i felt that the nautilus was perfectly still i dressed quickly and entered the saloon captain nemo was there waiting for me he rose bowed and asked me if it was convenient for me to accompany him as he made no allusion to his absence during the last eight days i did not mention it and simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him we entered the diningroom where breakfast was served m aronnax said the captain pray share my breakfast without ceremony we will chat as we eat for though i promised you a walk in the forest i did not undertake to find hotels there so breakfast as a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late i did honour to the repast it was composed of several kinds of fish and slices of seacucumber and different sorts of seaweed our drink consisted of pure water to which the captain added some drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the kamschatcha method from a seaweed known under the name of rhodomenia palmata captain nemo ate at first without saying a word then he began sir when i proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of crespo you evidently thought me mad sir you should never judge lightly of any man but captain believe me be kind enough to listen and you will then see whether you have any cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction i listen you know as well as i do professor that man can live under water providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air in submarine works the workman clad in an impervious dress with his head in a metal helmet receives air from above by means of forcing pumps and regulators that is a diving apparatus said i just so but under these conditions the man is not at liberty he is attached to the pump which sends him air through an indiarubber tube and if we were obliged to be thus held to the nautilus we could not go far and the means of getting free i asked it is to use the rouquayrol apparatus invented by two of your own countrymen which i have brought to perfection for my own use and which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological conditions without any organ whatever suffering it consists of a reservoir of thick iron plates in which i store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres this reservoir is fixed on the back by means of braces like a soldiers knapsack its upper part forms a box in which the air is kept by means of a bellows and therefore cannot escape unless at its normal tension in the rouquayrol apparatus such as we use two india rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of tent which holds the nose and mouth one is to introduce fresh air the other to let out the foul and the tongue closes one or the other according to the wants of the respirator but i in encountering great pressures at the bottom of the sea was obliged to shut my head like that of a diver in a ball of copper and it is to this ball of copper that the two pipes the inspirator and the expirator open perfectly captain nemo but the air that you carry with you must soon be used when it only contains fifteen per cent of oxygen it is no longer fit to breathe right but i told you m aronnax that the pumps of the nautilus allow me to store the air under considerable pressure and on those conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air for nine or ten hours i have no further objections to make i answered i will only ask you one thing captainhow can you light your road at the bottom of the sea with the ruhmkorff apparatus m aronnax one is carried on the back the other is fastened to the waist it is composed of a bunsen pile which i do not work with bichromate of potash but with sodium a wire is introduced which collects the electricity produced and directs it towards a particularly made lantern in this lantern is a spiral glass which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas when the apparatus is at work this gas becomes luminous giving out a white and continuous light thus provided i can breathe and i can see captain nemo to all my objections you make such crushing answers that i dare no longer doubt but if i am forced to admit the rouquayrol and ruhmkorff apparatus i must be allowed some reservations with regard to the gun i am to carry but it is not a gun for powder answered the captain then it is an airgun doubtless how would you have me manufacture gun powder on board without either saltpetre sulphur or charcoal besides i added to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and fiftyfive times denser than the air we must conquer very considerable resistance that would be no difficulty there exist guns according to fulton perfected in england by philip coles and burley in france by furcy and in italy by landi which are furnished with a peculiar system of closing which can fire under these conditions but i repeat having no powder i use air under great pressure which the pumps of the nautilus furnish abundantly but this air must be rapidly used well have i not my rouquayrol reservoir which can furnish it at need a tap is all that is required besides m aronnax you must see yourself that during our submarine hunt we can spend but little air and but few balls but it seems to me that in this twilight and in the midst of this fluid which is very dense compared with the atmosphere shots could not go far nor easily prove mortal sir on the contrary with this gun every blow is mortal and however lightly the animal is touched it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt why because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls but little cases of glass these glass cases are covered with a case of steel and weighted with a pellet of lead they are real leyden bottles into which the electricity is forced to a very high tension with the slightest shock they are discharged and the animal however strong it may be falls dead i must tell you that these cases are size number four and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten i will argue no longer i replied rising from the table i have nothing left me but to take my gun at all events i will go where you go captain nemo then led me aft and in passing before neds and conseils cabin i called my two companions who followed promptly we then came to a cell near the machineryroom in which we put on our walkingdress a walk on the bottom of the sea this cell was to speak correctly the arsenal and wardrobe of the nautilus a dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting our use ned land on seeing them showed evident repugnance to dress himself in one but my worthy ned the forests of the island of crespo are nothing but submarine forests good said the disappointed harpooner who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away and you m aronnax are you going to dress yourself in those clothes there is no alternative master ned as you please sir replied the harpooner shrugging his shoulders but as for me unless i am forced i will never get into one no one will force you master ned said captain nemo is conseil going to risk it asked ned i follow my master wherever he goes replied conseil at the captains call two of the ships crew came to help us dress in these heavy and impervious clothes made of indiarubber without seam and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure one would have thought it a suit of armour both supple and resisting this suit formed trousers and waistcoat the trousers were finished off with thick boots weighted with heavy leaden soles the texture of the waistcoat was held together by bands of copper which crossed the chest protecting it from the great pressure of the water and leaving the lungs free to act the sleeves ended in gloves which in no way restrained the movement of the hands there was a vast difference noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork breastplates jackets and other contrivances in vogue during the eighteenth century captain nemo and one of his companions a sort of hercules who must have possessed great strength conseil and myself were soon enveloped in the dresses there remained nothing more to be done but to enclose our heads in the metal box but before proceeding to this operation i asked the captains permission to examine the guns one of the nautilus men gave me a simple gun the butt end of which made of steel hollow in the centre was rather large it served as a reservoir for compressed air which a valve worked by a spring allowed to escape into a metal tube a box of projectiles in a groove in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these electric balls which by means of a spring were forced into the barrel of the gun as soon as one shot was fired another was ready captain nemo said i this arm is perfect and easily handled i only ask to be allowed to try it but how shall we gain the bottom of the sea at this moment professor the nautilus is stranded in five fathoms and we have nothing to do but to start but how shall we get off you shall see captain nemo thrust his head into the helmet conseil and i did the same not without hearing an ironical good sport from the canadian the upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which was screwed the metal helmet three holes protected by thick glass allowed us to see in all directions by simply turning our head in the interior of the headdress as soon as it was in position the rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act and for my part i could breathe with ease with the ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt and the gun in my hand i was ready to set out but to speak the truth imprisoned in these heavy garments and glued to the deck by my leaden soles it was impossible for me to take a step but this state of things was provided for i felt myself being pushed into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room my companions followed towed along in the same way i heard a watertight door furnished with stopper plates close upon us and we were wrapped in profound darkness after some minutes a loud hissing was heard i felt the cold mount from my feet to my chest evidently from some part of the vessel they had by means of a tap given entrance to the water which was invading us and with which the room was soon filled a second door cut in the side of the nautilus then opened we saw a faint light in another instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea and now how can i retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters words are impotent to relate such wonders captain nemo walked in front his companion followed some steps behind conseil and i remained near each other as if an exchange of words had been possible through our metallic cases i no longer felt the weight of my clothing or of my shoes of my reservoir of air or my thick helmet in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its shell the light which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean astonished me by its power the solar rays shone through the watery mass easily and dissipated all colour and i clearly distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine and faded into vague obscurity truly this water which surrounded me was but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere but almost as transparent above me was the calm surface of the sea we were walking on fine even sand not wrinkled as on a flat shore which retains the impression of the billows this dazzling carpet really a reflector repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity which accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid shall i be believed when i say that at the depth of thirty feet i could see as if i was in broad daylight for a quarter of an hour i trod on this sand sown with the impalpable dust of shells the hull of the nautilus resembling a long shoal disappeared by degrees but its lantern when darkness should overtake us in the waters would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible i recognised magnificent rocks hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the most beautiful kind and i was at first struck by the peculiar effect of this medium it was then ten in the morning the rays of the sun struck the surface of the waves at rather an oblique angle and at the touch of their light decomposed by refraction as through a prism flowers rocks plants shells and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar colours it was marvellous a feast for the eyes this complication of coloured tints a perfect kaleidoscope of green yellow orange violet indigo and blue in one word the whole palette of an enthusiastic colourist why could i not communicate to conseil the lively sensations which were mounting to my brain and rival him in expressions of admiration for aught i knew captain nemo and his companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs previously agreed upon so for want of better i talked to myself i declaimed in the copper box which covered my head thereby expending more air in vain words than was perhaps wise various kinds of isis clusters of pure tuftcoral prickly fungi and anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers decked with their collarettes of blue tentacles seastars studding the sandy bottom it was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands of hammerheads donaciae veritable bounding shells of staircases and red helmetshells angelwings and many others produced by this inexhaustible ocean but we were bound to walk so we went on whilst above our heads waved medusae whose umbrellas of opal or rosepink escalloped with a band of blue sheltered us from the rays of the sun and fiery pelagiae which in the darkness would have strewn our path with phosphorescent light all these wonders i saw in the space of a quarter of a mile scarcely stopping and following captain nemo who beckoned me on by signs soon the nature of the soil changed to the sandy plain succeeded an extent of slimy mud which the americans call ooze composed of equal parts of silicious and calcareous shells we then travelled over a plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation this sward was of close texture and soft to the feet and rivalled the softest carpet woven by the hand of man but whilst verdure was spread at our feet it did not abandon our heads a light network of marine plants of that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand kinds are known grew on the surface of the water i noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea whilst the red were at a greater depth leaving to the black or brown the care of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean we had quitted the nautilus about an hour and a half it was near noon i knew by the perpendicularity of the suns rays which were no longer refracted the magical colours disappeared by degrees and the shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced we walked with a regular step which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity the slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is unaccustomed on the earth indeed water is a better conductor of sound than air in the ratio of four to one at this period the earth sloped downwards the light took a uniform tint we were at a depth of a hundred and five yards and twenty inches undergoing a pressure of six atmospheres at this depth i could still see the rays of the sun though feebly to their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight the lowest state between day and night but we could still see well enough it was not necessary to resort to the ruhmkorff apparatus as yet at this moment captain nemo stopped he waited till i joined him and then pointed to an obscure mass looming in the shadow at a short distance it is the forest of the island of crespo thought i and i was not mistaken a submarine forest we had at last arrived on the borders of this forest doubtless one of the finest of captain nemos immense domains he looked upon it as his own and considered he had the same right over it that the first men had in the first days of the world and indeed who would have disputed with him the possession of this submarine property what other hardier pioneer would come hatchet in hand to cut down the dark copses this forest was composed of large treeplants and the moment we penetrated under its vast arcades i was struck by the singular position of their branchesa position i had not yet observed not an herb which carpeted the ground not a branch which clothed the trees was either broken or bent nor did they extend horizontally all stretched up to the surface of the ocean not a filament not a ribbon however thin they might be but kept as straight as a rod of iron the fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines due to the density of the element which had produced them motionless yet when bent to one side by the hand they directly resumed their former position truly it was the region of perpendicularity i soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position as well as to the comparative darkness which surrounded us the soil of the forest seemed covered with sharp blocks difficult to avoid the submarine flora struck me as being very perfect and richer even than it would have been in the arctic or tropical zones where these productions are not so plentiful but for some minutes i involuntarily confounded the genera taking animals for plants and who would not have been mistaken the fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this submarine world these plants are selfpropagated and the principle of their existence is in the water which upholds and nourishes them the greater number instead of leaves shoot forth blades of capricious shapes comprised within a scale of colours pink carmine green olive fawn and brown curious anomaly fantastic element said an ingenious naturalist in which the animal kingdom blossoms and the vegetable does not in about an hour captain nemo gave the signal to halt i for my part was not sorry and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariae the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows this short rest seemed delicious to me there was nothing wanting but the charm of conversation but impossible to speak impossible to answer i only put my great copper head to conseils i saw the worthy fellows eyes glistening with delight and to show his satisfaction he shook himself in his breastplate of air in the most comical way in the world after four hours of this walking i was surprised not to find myself dreadfully hungry how to account for this state of the stomach i could not tell but instead i felt an insurmountable desire to sleep which happens to all divers and my eyes soon closed behind the thick glasses and i fell into a heavy slumber which the movement alone had prevented before captain nemo and his robust companion stretched in the clear crystal set us the example how long i remained buried in this drowsiness i cannot judge but when i woke the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon captain nemo had already risen and i was beginning to stretch my limbs when an unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet a few steps off a monstrous seaspider about thirtyeight inches high was watching me with squinting eyes ready to spring upon me though my divers dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of this animal i could not help shuddering with horror conseil and the sailor of the nautilus awoke at this moment captain nemo pointed out the hideous crustacean which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over and i saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in terrible convulsions this incident reminded me that other animals more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths against whose attacks my divingdress would not protect me i had never thought of it before but i now resolved to be upon my guard indeed i thought that this halt would mark the termination of our walk but i was mistaken for instead of returning to the nautilus captain nemo continued his bold excursion the ground was still on the incline its declivity seemed to be getting greater and to be leading us to greater depths it must have been about three oclock when we reached a narrow valley between high perpendicular walls situated about seventyfive fathoms deep thanks to the perfection of our apparatus we were fortyfive fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed on man as to his submarine excursions i say seventyfive fathoms though i had no instrument by which to judge the distance but i knew that even in the clearest waters the solar rays could not penetrate further and accordingly the darkness deepened at ten paces not an object was visible i was groping my way when i suddenly saw a brilliant white light captain nemo had just put his electric apparatus into use his companion did the same and conseil and i followed their example by turning a screw i established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass and the sea lit by our four lanterns was illuminated for a circle of thirtysix yards as we walked i thought the light of our ruhmkorff apparatus could not fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch but if they did approach us they at least kept at a respectful distance from the hunters several times i saw captain nemo stop put his gun to his shoulder and after some moments drop it and walk on at last after about four hours this marvellous excursion came to an end a wall of superb rocks in an imposing mass rose before us a heap of gigantic blocks an enormous steep granite shore forming dark grottos but which presented no practicable slope it was the prop of the island of crespo it was the earth captain nemo stopped suddenly a gesture of his brought us all to a halt and however desirous i might be to scale the wall i was obliged to stop here ended captain nemos domains and he would not go beyond them further on was a portion of the globe he might not trample upon the return began captain nemo had returned to the head of his little band directing their course without hesitation i thought we were not following the same road to return to the nautilus the new road was very steep and consequently very painful we approached the surface of the sea rapidly but this return to the upper strata was not so sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly which might have produced serious disorder in our organisation and brought on internal lesions so fatal to divers very soon light reappeared and grew and the sun being low on the horizon the refraction edged the different objects with a spectral ring at ten yards and a half deep we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds more numerous than the birds of the air and also more agile but no aquatic game worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze when at that moment i saw the captain shoulder his gun quickly and follow a moving object into the shrubs he fired i heard a slight hissing and a creature fell stunned at some distance from us it was a magnificent seaotter an enhydrus the only exclusively marine quadruped this otter was five feet long and must have been very valuable its skin chestnutbrown above and silvery underneath would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after in the russian and chinese markets the fineness and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch l80 i admired this curious mammal with its rounded head ornamented with short ears its round eyes and white whiskers like those of a cat with webbed feet and nails and tufted tail this precious animal hunted and tracked by fishermen has now become very rare and taken refuge chiefly in the northern parts of the pacific or probably its race would soon become extinct captain nemos companion took the beast threw it over his shoulder and we continued our journey for one hour a plain of sand lay stretched before us sometimes it rose to within two yards and some inches of the surface of the water i then saw our image clearly reflected drawn inversely and above us appeared an identical group reflecting our movements and our actions in a word like us in every point except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet in the air another effect i noticed which was the passage of thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly but on reflection i understood that these seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the bottom and i could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops multiplied on the water and the shadows of large birds passing above our heads whose rapid flight i could discern on the surface of the sea on this occasion i was witness to one of the finest gun shots which ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill a large bird of great breadth of wing clearly visible approached hovering over us captain nemos companion shouldered his gun and fired when it was only a few yards above the waves the creature fell stunned and the force of its fall brought it within the reach of dexterous hunters grasp it was an albatross of the finest kind our march had not been interrupted by this incident for two hours we followed these sandy plains then fields of algae very disagreeable to cross candidly i could do no more when i saw a glimmer of light which for a half mile broke the darkness of the waters it was the lantern of the nautilus before twenty minutes were over we should be on board and i should be able to breathe with ease for it seemed that my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen but i did not reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time i had remained some steps behind when i presently saw captain nemo coming hurriedly towards me with his strong hand he bent me to the ground his companion doing the same to conseil at first i knew not what to think of this sudden attack but i was soon reassured by seeing the captain lie down beside me and remain immovable i was stretched on the ground just under the shelter of a bush of algae when raising my head i saw some enormous mass casting phosphorescent gleams pass blusteringly by my blood froze in my veins as i recognised two formidable sharks which threatened us it was a couple of tintoreas terrible creatures with enormous tails and a dull glassy stare the phosphorescent matter ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle monstrous brutes which would crush a whole man in their iron jaws i did not know whether conseil stopped to classify them for my part i noticed their silver bellies and their huge mouths bristling with teeth from a very unscientific point of view and more as a possible victim than as a naturalist happily the voracious creatures do not see well they passed without seeing us brushing us with their brownish fins and we escaped by a miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger fullface in the forest half an hour after guided by the electric light we reached the nautilus the outside door had been left open and captain nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell he then pressed a knob i heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel i felt the water sinking from around me and in a few moments the cell was entirely empty the inside door then opened and we entered the vestry there our divingdress was taken off not without some trouble and fairly worn out from want of food and sleep i returned to my room in great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea four thousand leagues under the pacific the next morning the 18th of november i had quite recovered from my fatigues of the day before and i went up on to the platform just as the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase i was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when captain nemo appeared he did not seem to be aware of my presence and began a series of astronomical observations then when he had finished he went and leant on the cage of the watchlight and gazed abstractedly on the ocean in the meantime a number of the sailors of the nautilus all strong and healthy men had come up onto the platform they came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night these sailors were evidently of different nations although the european type was visible in all of them i recognised some unmistakable irishmen frenchmen some sclaves and a greek or a candiote they were civil and only used that odd language among themselves the origin of which i could not guess neither could i question them the nets were hauled in they were a large kind of chaluts like those on the normandy coasts great pockets that the waves and a chain fixed in the smaller meshes kept open these pockets drawn by iron poles swept through the water and gathered in everything in their way that day they brought up curious specimens from those productive coasts i reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of fish it was a fine haul but not to be wondered at indeed the nets are let down for several hours and enclose in their meshes an infinite variety we had no lack of excellent food and the rapidity of the nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew our supply these several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the stewards room some to be eaten fresh and others pickled the fishing ended the provision of air renewed i thought that the nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion and was preparing to return to my room when without further preamble the captain turned to me saying professor is not this ocean gifted with real life it has its tempers and its gentle moods yesterday it slept as we did and now it has woke after a quiet night look he continued it wakes under the caresses of the sun it is going to renew its diurnal existence it is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation it has a pulse arteries spasms and i agree with the learned maury who discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in animals yes the ocean has indeed circulation and to promote it the creator has caused things to multiply in itcaloric salt and animalculae when captain nemo spoke thus he seemed altogether changed and aroused an extraordinary emotion in me also he added true existence is there and i can imagine the foundations of nautical towns clusters of submarine houses which like the nautilus would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface of the water free towns independent cities yet who knows whether some despot captain nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture then addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought m aronnax he asked do you know the depth of the ocean i only know captain what the principal soundings have taught us could you tell me them so that i can suit them to my purpose these are some i replied that i remember if i am not mistaken a depth of 8000 yards has been found in the north atlantic and 2500 yards in the mediterranean the most remarkable soundings have been made in the south atlantic near the thirtyfifth parallel and they gave 12000 yards 14000 yards and 15000 yards to sum up all it is reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled its mean depth would be about one and threequarter leagues well professor replied the captain we shall show you better than that i hope as to the mean depth of this part of the pacific i tell you it is only 4000 yards having said this captain nemo went towards the panel and disappeared down the ladder i followed him and went into the large drawingroom the screw was immediately put in motion and the log gave twenty miles an hour during the days and weeks that passed captain nemo was very sparing of his visits i seldom saw him the lieutenant pricked the ships course regularly on the chart so i could always tell exactly the route of the nautilus nearly every day for some time the panels of the drawingroom were opened and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the submarine world the general direction of the nautilus was southeast and it kept between 100 and 150 yards of depth one day however i do not know why being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes it touched the bed of the sea the thermometer indicated a temperature of 425 cent a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all latitudes at three oclock in the morning of the 26th of november the nautilus crossed the tropic of cancer at 172 deg long on 27th instant it sighted the sandwich islands where cook died february 14 1779 we had then gone 4860 leagues from our startingpoint in the morning when i went on the platform i saw two miles to windward hawaii the largest of the seven islands that form the group i saw clearly the cultivated ranges and the several mountainchains that run parallel with the side and the volcanoes that overtop mounarea which rise 5000 yards above the level of the sea besides other things the nets brought up were several flabellariae and graceful polypi that are peculiar to that part of the ocean the direction of the nautilus was still to the southeast it crossed the equator december 1 in 142 deg long and on the 4th of the same month after crossing rapidly and without anything in particular occurring we sighted the marquesas group i saw three miles off martins peak in noukahiva the largest of the group that belongs to france i only saw the woody mountains against the horizon because captain nemo did not wish to bring the ship to the wind there the nets brought up beautiful specimens of fish some with azure fins and tails like gold the flesh of which is unrivalled some nearly destitute of scales but of exquisite flavour others with bony jaws and yellowtinged gills as good as bonitos all fish that would be of use to us after leaving these charming islands protected by the french flag from the 4th to the 11th of december the nautilus sailed over about 2000 miles during the daytime of the 11th of december i was busy reading in the large drawingroom ned land and conseil watched the luminous water through the halfopen panels the nautilus was immovable while its reservoirs were filled it kept at a depth of 1000 yards a region rarely visited in the ocean and in which large fish were seldom seen i was then reading a charming book by jean mace the slaves of the stomach and i was learning some valuable lessons from it when conseil interrupted me will master come here a moment he said in a curious voice what is the matter conseil i want master to look i rose went and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched in a full electric light an enormous black mass quite immovable was suspended in the midst of the waters i watched it attentively seeking to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean but a sudden thought crossed my mind a vessel i said half aloud yes replied the canadian a disabled ship that has sunk perpendicularly ned land was right we were close to a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains the keel seemed to be in good order and it had been wrecked at most some few hours three stumps of masts broken off about two feet above the bridge showed that the vessel had had to sacrifice its masts but lying on its side it had filled and it was heeling over to port this skeleton of what it had once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves but sadder still was the sight of the bridge where some corpses bound with ropes were still lying i counted fivefour men one of whom was standing at the helm and a woman standing by the poop holding an infant in her arms she was quite young i could distinguish her features which the water had not decomposed by the brilliant light from the nautilus in one despairing effort she had raised her infant above her headpoor little thingwhose arms encircled its mothers neck the attitude of the four sailors was frightful distorted as they were by their convulsive movements whilst making a last effort to free themselves from the cords that bound them to the vessel the steersman alone calm with a grave clear face his grey hair glued to his forehead and his hand clutching the wheel of the helm seemed even then to be guiding the three broken masts through the depths of the ocean what a scene we were dumb our hearts beat fast before this shipwreck taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments and i saw already coming towards it with hungry eyes enormous sharks attracted by the human flesh however the nautilus turning went round the submerged vessel and in one instant i read on the sternthe florida sunderland vanikoro this terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime catastrophes that the nautilus was destined to meet with in its route as long as it went through more frequented waters we often saw the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths and deeper down cannons bullets anchors chains and a thousand other iron materials eaten up by rust however on the 11th of december we sighted the pomotou islands the old dangerous group of bougainville that extend over a space of 500 leagues at ese to wnw from the island ducie to that of lazareff this group covers an area of 370 square leagues and it is formed of sixty groups of islands among which the gambier group is remarkable over which france exercises sway these are coral islands slowly raised but continuous created by the daily work of polypi then this new island will be joined later on to the neighboring groups and a fifth continent will stretch from new zealand and new caledonia and from thence to the marquesas one day when i was suggesting this theory to captain nemo he replied coldly the earth does not want new continents but new men chance had conducted the nautilus towards the island of clermonttonnere one of the most curious of the group that was discovered in 1822 by captain bell of the minerva i could study now the madreporal system to which are due the islands in this ocean madrepores which must not be mistaken for corals have a tissue lined with a calcareous crust and the modifications of its structure have induced m milne edwards my worthy master to class them into five sections the animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by millions at the bottom of their cells their calcareous deposits become rocks reefs and large and small islands here they form a ring surrounding a little inland lake that communicates with the sea by means of gaps there they make barriers of reefs like those on the coasts of new caledonia and the various pomoton islands in other places like those at reunion and at maurice they raise fringed reefs high straight walls near which the depth of the ocean is considerable some cablelengths off the shores of the island of clermont i admired the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers these walls are specially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas porites madrepores and astraeas these polypi are found particularly in the rough beds of the sea near the surface and consequently it is from the upper part that they begin their operations in which they bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that support them such is at least darwins theory who thus explains the formation of the _atolls_ a superior theory to my mind to that given of the foundation of the madreporical works summits of mountains or volcanoes that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea i could observe closely these curious walls for perpendicularly they were more than 300 yards deep and our electric sheets lighted up this calcareous matter brilliantly replying to a question conseil asked me as to the time these colossal barriers took to be raised i astonished him much by telling him that learned men reckoned it about the eighth of an inch in a hundred years towards evening clermonttonnerre was lost in the distance and the route of the nautilus was sensibly changed after having crossed the tropic of capricorn in 135 deg longitude it sailed wnw making again for the tropical zone although the summer sun was very strong we did not suffer from heat for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the surface the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees on 15th of december we left to the east the bewitching group of the societies and the graceful tahiti queen of the pacific i saw in the morning some miles to the windward the elevated summits of the island these waters furnished our table with excellent fish mackerel bonitos and some varieties of a seaserpent on the 25th of december the nautilus sailed into the midst of the new hebrides discovered by quiros in 1606 and that bougainville explored in 1768 and to which cook gave its present name in 1773 this group is composed principally of nine large islands that form a band of 120 leagues nns to ssw between 15 deg and 2 deg s lat and 164 deg and 168 deg long we passed tolerably near to the island of aurou that at noon looked like a mass of green woods surmounted by a peak of great height that day being christmas day ned land seemed to regret sorely the noncelebration of christmas the family fete of which protestants are so fond i had not seen captain nemo for a week when on the morning of the 27th he came into the large drawingroom always seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before i was busily tracing the route of the nautilus on the planisphere the captain came up to me put his finger on one spot on the chart and said this single word vanikoro the effect was magical it was the name of the islands on which la perouse had been lost i rose suddenly the nautilus has brought us to vanikoro i asked yes professor said the captain and i can visit the celebrated islands where the boussole and the astrolabe struck if you like professor when shall we be there we are there now followed by captain nemo i went up on to the platform and greedily scanned the horizon to the ne two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size surrounded by a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference we were close to vanikoro really the one to which dumont durville gave the name of isle de la recherche and exactly facing the little harbour of vanou situated in 16 deg 4 s lat and 164 deg 32 e long the earth seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the interior that were crowned by mount kapogo 476 feet high the nautilus having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep under the verdant shade of some mangroves i perceived some savages who appeared greatly surprised at our approach in the long black body moving between wind and water did they not see some formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion just then captain nemo asked me what i knew about the wreck of la perouse only what everyone knows captain i replied and could you tell me what everyone knows about it he inquired ironically easily i related to him all that the last works of dumont durville had made knownworks from which the following is a brief account la perouse and his second captain de langle were sent by louis xvi in 1785 on a voyage of circumnavigation they embarked in the corvettes boussole and the astrolabe neither of which were again heard of in 1791 the french government justly uneasy as to the fate of these two sloops manned two large merchantmen the recherche and the esperance which left brest the 28th of september under the command of bruni dentrecasteaux two months after they learned from bowen commander of the albemarle that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of new georgia but dentrecasteaux ignoring this communicationrather uncertain besidesdirected his course towards the admiralty islands mentioned in a report of captain hunters as being the place where la perouse was wrecked they sought in vain the esperance and the recherche passed before vanikoro without stopping there and in fact this voyage was most disastrous as it cost dentrecasteaux his life and those of two of his lieutenants besides several of his crew captain dillon a shrewd old pacific sailor was the first to find unmistakable traces of the wrecks on the 15th of may 1824 his vessel the st patrick passed close to tikopia one of the new hebrides there a lascar came alongside in a canoe sold him the handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the hilt the lascar pretended that six years before during a stay at vanikoro he had seen two europeans that belonged to some vessels that had run aground on the reefs some years ago dillon guessed that he meant la perouse whose disappearance had troubled the whole world he tried to get on to vanikoro where according to the lascar he would find numerous debris of the wreck but winds and tides prevented him dillon returned to calcutta there he interested the asiatic society and the indian company in his discovery a vessel to which was given the name of the recherche was put at his disposal and he set out 23rd january 1827 accompanied by a french agent the recherche after touching at several points in the pacific cast anchor before vanikoro 7th july 1827 in that same harbour of vanou where the nautilus was at this time there it collected numerous relics of the wreckiron utensils anchors pulleystrops swivelguns an 18 lb shot fragments of astronomical instruments a piece of crown work and a bronze clock bearing this inscriptionbazin ma fait the mark of the foundry of the arsenal at brest about 1785 there could be no further doubt dillon having made all inquiries stayed in the unlucky place till october then he quitted vanikoro and directed his course towards new zealand put into calcutta 7th april 1828 and returned to france where he was warmly welcomed by charles x but at the same time without knowing dillons movements dumont durville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck and they had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of st louis had been found in the hands of some savages of louisiade and new caledonia dumont durville commander of the astrolabe had then sailed and two months after dillon had left vanikoro he put into hobart town there he learned the results of dillons inquiries and found that a certain james hobbs second lieutenant of the union of calcutta after landing on an island situated 8 deg 18 s lat and 156 deg 30 e long had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these parts dumont durville much perplexed and not knowing how to credit the reports of lowclass journals decided to follow dillons track on the 10th of february 1828 the astrolabe appeared off tikopia and took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island made his way to vanikoro sighted it on the 12th inst lay among the reefs until the 14th and not until the 20th did he cast anchor within the barrier in the harbour of vanou on the 23rd several officers went round the island and brought back some unimportant trifles the natives adopting a system of denials and evasions refused to take them to the unlucky place this ambiguous conduct led them to believe that the natives had illtreated the castaways and indeed they seemed to fear that dumont durville had come to avenge la perouse and his unfortunate crew however on the 26th appeased by some presents and understanding that they had no reprisals to fear they led m jacquireot to the scene of the wreck there in three or four fathoms of water between the reefs of pacou and vanou lay anchors cannons pigs of lead and iron embedded in the limy concretions the large boat and the whaler belonging to the astrolabe were sent to this place and not without some difficulty their crews hauled up an anchor weighing 1800 lbs a brass gun some pigs of iron and two copper swivelguns dumont durville questioning the natives learned too that la perouse after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island had constructed a smaller boat only to be lost a second time where no one knew but the french government fearing that dumont durville was not acquainted with dillons movements had sent the sloop bayonnaise commanded by legoarant de tromelin to vanikoro which had been stationed on the west coast of america the bayonnaise cast her anchor before vanikoro some months after the departure of the astrolabe but found no new document but stated that the savages had respected the monument to la perouse that is the substance of what i told captain nemo so he said no one knows now where the third vessel perished that was constructed by the castaways on the island of vanikoro no one knows captain nemo said nothing but signed to me to follow him into the large saloon the nautilus sank several yards below the waves and the panels were opened i hastened to the aperture and under the crustations of coral covered with fungi syphonules alcyons madrepores through myriads of charming fishgirelles glyphisidri pompherides diacopes and holocentresi recognised certain debris that the drags had not been able to tear upiron stirrups anchors cannons bullets capstan fittings the stem of a ship all objects clearly proving the wreck of some vessel and now carpeted with living flowers while i was looking on this desolate scene captain nemo said in a sad voice commander la perouse set out 7th december 1785 with his vessels la boussole and the astrolabe he first cast anchor at botany bay visited the friendly isles new caledonia then directed his course towards santa cruz and put into namouka one of the hapai group then his vessels struck on the unknown reefs of vanikoro the boussole which went first ran aground on the southerly coast the astrolabe went to its help and ran aground too the first vessel was destroyed almost immediately the second stranded under the wind resisted some days the natives made the castaways welcome they installed themselves in the island and constructed a smaller boat with the debris of the two large ones some sailors stayed willingly at vanikoro the others weak and ill set out with la perouse they directed their course towards the solomon islands and there perished with everything on the westerly coast of the chief island of the group between capes deception and satisfaction how do you know that by this that i found on the spot where was the last wreck captain nemo showed me a tinplate box stamped with the french arms and corroded by the salt water he opened it and i saw a bundle of papers yellow but still readable they were the instructions of the naval minister to commander la perouse annotated in the margin in louis xvis handwriting ah it is a fine death for a sailor said captain nemo at last a coral tomb makes a quiet grave and i trust that i and my comrades will find no other torres straits during the night of the 27th or 28th of december the nautilus left the shores of vanikoro with great speed her course was southwesterly and in three days she had gone over the 750 leagues that separated it from la perouses group and the southeast point of papua early on the 1st of january 1863 conseil joined me on the platform master will you permit me to wish you a happy new year what conseil exactly as if i was at paris in my study at the jardin des plantes well i accept your good wishes and thank you for them only i will ask you what you mean by a happy new year under our circumstances do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of our imprisonment or the year that sees us continue this strange voyage really i do not know how to answer master we are sure to see curious things and for the last two months we have not had time for dullness the last marvel is always the most astonishing and if we continue this progression i do not know how it will end it is my opinion that we shall never again see the like i think then with no offence to master that a happy year would be one in which we could see everything on 2nd january we had made 11340 miles or 5250 french leagues since our startingpoint in the japan seas before the ships head stretched the dangerous shores of the coral sea on the northeast coast of australia our boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on which cooks vessel was lost 10th june 1770 the boat in which cook was struck on a rock and if it did not sink it was owing to a piece of coral that was broken by the shock and fixed itself in the broken keel i had wished to visit the reef 360 leagues long against which the sea always rough broke with great violence with a noise like thunder but just then the inclined planes drew the nautilus down to a great depth and i could see nothing of the high coral walls i had to content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the nets i remarked among others some germons a species of mackerel as large as a tunny with bluish sides and striped with transverse bands that disappear with the animals life these fish followed us in shoals and furnished us with very delicate food we took also a large number of giltheads about one and a half inches long tasting like dorys and flying pyrapeds like submarine swallows which in dark nights light alternately the air and water with their phosphorescent light among the molluscs and zoophytes i found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians echini hammers spurs dials cerites and hyalleae the flora was represented by beautiful floating seaweeds laminariae and macrocystes impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores and among which i gathered an admirable nemastoma geliniarois that was classed among the natural curiosities of the museum two days after crossing the coral sea 4th january we sighted the papuan coasts on this occasion captain nemo informed me that his intention was to get into the indian ocean by the strait of torres his communication ended there the torres straits are nearly thirtyfour leagues wide but they are obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands islets breakers and rocks that make its navigation almost impracticable so that captain nemo took all needful precautions to cross them the nautilus floating betwixt wind and water went at a moderate pace her screw like a cetaceans tail beat the waves slowly profiting by this i and my two companions went up on to the deserted platform before us was the steersmans cage and i expected that captain nemo was there directing the course of the nautilus i had before me the excellent charts of the straits of torres and i consulted them attentively round the nautilus the sea dashed furiously the course of the waves that went from southeast to northwest at the rate of two and a half miles broke on the coral that showed itself here and there this is a bad sea remarked ned land detestable indeed and one that does not suit a boat like the nautilus the captain must be very sure of his route for i see there pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly indeed the situation was dangerous but the nautilus seemed to slide like magic off these rocks it did not follow the routes of the astrolabe and the zelee exactly for they proved fatal to dumont durville it bore more northwards coasted the islands of murray and came back to the southwest towards cumberland passage i thought it was going to pass it by when going back to northwest it went through a large quantity of islands and islets little known towards the island sound and canal mauvais i wondered if captain nemo foolishly imprudent would steer his vessel into that pass where dumont durvilles two corvettes touched when swerving again and cutting straight through to the west he steered for the island of gilboa it was then three in the afternoon the tide began to recede being quite full the nautilus approached the island that i still saw with its remarkable border of screwpines he stood off it at about two miles distant suddenly a shock overthrew me the nautilus just touched a rock and stayed immovable laying lightly to port side when i rose i perceived captain nemo and his lieutenant on the platform they were examining the situation of the vessel and exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect she was situated thus two miles on the starboard side appeared gilboa stretching from north to west like an immense arm towards the south and east some coral showed itself left by the ebb we had run aground and in one of those seas where the tides are middlinga sorry matter for the floating of the nautilus however the vessel had not suffered for her keel was solidly joined but if she could neither glide off nor move she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to these rocks and then captain nemos submarine vessel would be done for i was reflecting thus when the captain cool and calm always master of himself approached me an accident i asked no an incident but an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant of this land from which you flee captain nemo looked at me curiously and made a negative gesture as much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma again then he said besides m aronnax the nautilus is not lost it will carry you yet into the midst of the marvels of the ocean our voyage is only begun and i do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your company however captain nemo i replied without noticing the ironical turn of his phrase the nautilus ran aground in open sea now the tides are not strong in the pacific and if you cannot lighten the nautilus i do not see how it will be reinflated the tides are not strong in the pacific you are right there professor but in torres straits one finds still a difference of a yard and a half between the level of high and low seas today is 4th january and in five days the moon will be full now i shall be very much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water sufficiently and render me a service that i should be indebted to her for having said this captain nemo followed by his lieutenant redescended to the interior of the nautilus as to the vessel it moved not and was immovable as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with their in destructible cement well sir said ned land who came up to me after the departure of the captain well friend ned we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th instant for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it off again really really and this captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide will suffice said conseil simply the canadian looked at conseil then shrugged his shoulders sir you may believe me when i tell you that this piece of iron will navigate neither on nor under the sea again it is only fit to be sold for its weight i think therefore that the time has come to part company with captain nemo friend ned i do not despair of this stout nautilus as you do and in four days we shall know what to hold to on the pacific tides besides flight might be possible if we were in sight of the english or provencal coast but on the papuan shores it is another thing and it will be time enough to come to that extremity if the nautilus does not recover itself again which i look upon as a grave event but do they know at least how to act circumspectly there is an island on that island there are trees under those trees terrestrial animals bearers of cutlets and roast beef to which i would willingly give a trial in this friend ned is right said conseil and i agree with him could not master obtain permission from his friend captain nemo to put us on land if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the solid parts of our planet i can ask him but he will refuse will master risk it asked conseil and we shall know how to rely upon the captains amiability to my great surprise captain nemo gave me the permission i asked for and he gave it very agreeably without even exacting from me a promise to return to the vessel but flight across new guinea might be very perilous and i should not have counselled ned land to attempt it better to be a prisoner on board the nautilus than to fall into the hands of the natives at eight oclock armed with guns and hatchets we got off the nautilus the sea was pretty calm a slight breeze blew on land conseil and i rowing we sped along quickly and ned steered in the straight passage that the breakers left between them the boat was well handled and moved rapidly ned land could not restrain his joy he was like a prisoner that had escaped from prison and knew not that it was necessary to reenter it meat we are going to eat some meat and what meat he replied real game no bread indeed i do not say that fish is not good we must not abuse it but a piece of fresh venison grilled on live coals will agreeably vary our ordinary course glutton said conseil he makes my mouth water it remains to be seen i said if these forests are full of game and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself well said m aronnax replied the canadian whose teeth seemed sharpened like the edge of a hatchet but i will eat tigerloin of tigerif there is no other quadruped on this island friend ned is uneasy about it said conseil whatever it may be continued ned land every animal with four paws without feathers or with two paws without feathers will be saluted by my first shot very well master lands imprudences are beginning never fear m aronnax replied the canadian i do not want twentyfive minutes to offer you a dish of my sort at halfpast eight the nautilus boat ran softly aground on a heavy sand after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the island of gilboa a few days on land i was much impressed on touching land ned land tried the soil with his feet as if to take possession of it however it was only two months before that we had become according to captain nemo passengers on board the nautilus but in reality prisoners of its commander in a few minutes we were within musketshot of the coast the whole horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests enormous trees the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet were tied to each other by garlands of bindweed real natural hammocks which a light breeze rocked they were mimosas figs hibisci and palm trees mingled together in profusion and under the shelter of their verdant vault grew orchids leguminous plants and ferns but without noticing all these beautiful specimens of papuan flora the canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful he discovered a cocotree beat down some of the fruit broke them and we drunk the milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the ordinary food on the nautilus excellent said ned land exquisite replied conseil and i do not think said the canadian that he would object to our introducing a cargo of coconuts on board i do not think he would but he would not taste them so much the worse for him said conseil and so much the better for us replied ned land there will be more for us one word only master land i said to the harpooner who was beginning to ravage another coconut tree coconuts are good things but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the nautilus master is right replied conseil and i propose to reserve three places in our vessel one for fruits the other for vegetables and the third for the venison of which i have not yet seen the smallest specimen conseil we must not despair said the canadian let us continue i returned and lie in wait although the island seems uninhabited it might still contain some individuals that would be less hard than we on the nature of game ho ho said ned land moving his jaws significantly well ned said conseil my word returned the canadian i begin to understand the charms of anthropophagy ned ned what are you saying you a maneater i should not feel safe with you especially as i share your cabin i might perhaps wake one day to find myself half devoured friend conseil i like you much but not enough to eat you unnecessarily i would not trust you replied conseil but enough we must absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal or else one of these fine mornings master will find only pieces of his servant to serve him while we were talking thus we were penetrating the sombre arches of the forest and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables and one of the most useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food that we missed on board i would speak of the breadfruit tree very abundant in the island of gilboa and i remarked chiefly the variety destitute of seeds which bears in malaya the name of rima ned land knew these fruits well he had already eaten many during his numerous voyages and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance moreover the sight of them excited him and he could contain himself no longer master he said i shall die if i do not taste a little of this breadfruit pie taste it friend nedtaste it as you want we are here to make experimentsmake them it wont take long said the canadian and provided with a lentil he lighted a fire of dead wood that crackled joyously during this time conseil and i chose the best fruits of the breadfruit some had not then attained a sufficient degree of maturity and their thick skin covered a white but rather fibrous pulp others the greater number yellow and gelatinous waited only to be picked these fruits enclosed no kernel conseil brought a dozen to ned land who placed them on a coal fire after having cut them in thick slices and while doing this repeating you will see master how good this bread is more so when one has been deprived of it so long it is not even bread added he but a delicate pastry you have eaten none master no ned very well prepare yourself for a juicy thing if you do not come for more i am no longer the king of harpooners after some minutes the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire was completely roasted the interior looked like a white pasty a sort of soft crumb the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke it must be confessed this bread was excellent and i ate of it with great relish what time is it now asked the canadian two oclock at least replied conseil how time flies on firm ground sighed ned land let us be off replied conseil we returned through the forest and completed our collection by a raid upon the cabbagepalms that we gathered from the tops of the trees little beans that i recognised as the abrou of the malays and yams of a superior quality we were loaded when we reached the boat but ned land did not find his provisions sufficient fate however favoured us just as we were pushing off he perceived several trees from twentyfive to thirty feet high a species of palmtree at last at five oclock in the evening loaded with our riches we quitted the shore and half an hour after we hailed the nautilus no one appeared on our arrival the enormous ironplated cylinder seemed deserted the provisions embarked i descended to my chamber and after supper slept soundly the next day 6th january nothing new on board not a sound inside not a sign of life the boat rested along the edge in the same place in which we had left it we resolved to return to the island ned land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to the hunt and wished to visit another part of the forest at dawn we set off the boat carried on by the waves that flowed to shore reached the island in a few minutes we landed and thinking that it was better to give in to the canadian we followed ned land whose long limbs threatened to distance us he wound up the coast towards the west then fording some torrents he gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests some kingfishers were rambling along the watercourses but they would not let themselves be approached their circumspection proved to me that these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species and i concluded that if the island was not inhabited at least human beings occasionally frequented it after crossing a rather large prairie we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds there are only birds said conseil but they are eatable replied the harpooner i do not agree with you friend ned for i see only parrots there friend conseil said ned gravely the parrot is like pheasant to those who have nothing else and i added this bird suitably prepared is worth knife and fork indeed under the thick foliage of this wood a world of parrots were flying from branch to branch only needing a careful education to speak the human language for the moment they were chattering with parrots of all colours and grave cockatoos who seemed to meditate upon some philosophical problem whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece of bunting carried away by the breeze papuans with the finest azure colours and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold but few eatable however a bird peculiar to these lands and which has never passed the limits of the arrow and papuan islands was wanting in this collection but fortune reserved it for me before long after passing through a moderately thick copse we found a plain obstructed with bushes i saw then those magnificent birds the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind their undulating flight graceful aerial curves and the shading of their colours attracted and charmed ones looks i had no trouble in recognising them birds of paradise i exclaimed the malays who carry on a great trade in these birds with the chinese have several means that we could not employ for taking them sometimes they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise prefer to frequent sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime that paralyses their movements they even go so far as to poison the fountains that the birds generally drink from but we were obliged to fire at them during flight which gave us few chances to bring them down and indeed we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition about eleven oclock in the morning the first range of mountains that form the centre of the island was traversed and we had killed nothing hunger drove us on the hunters had relied on the products of the chase and they were wrong happily conseil to his great surprise made a double shot and secured breakfast he brought down a white pigeon and a woodpigeon which cleverly plucked and suspended from a skewer was roasted before a red fire of dead wood while these interesting birds were cooking ned prepared the fruit of the breadtree then the woodpigeons were devoured to the bones and declared excellent the nutmeg with which they are in the habit of stuffing their crops flavours their flesh and renders it delicious eating now ned what do you miss now some fourfooted game m aronnax all these pigeons are only sidedishes and trifles and until i have killed an animal with cutlets i shall not be content nor i ned if i do not catch a bird of paradise let us continue hunting replied conseil let us go towards the sea we have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains and i think we had better regain the region of forests that was sensible advice and was followed out after walking for one hour we had attained a forest of sagotrees some inoffensive serpents glided away from us the birds of paradise fled at our approach and truly i despaired of getting near one when conseil who was walking in front suddenly bent down uttered a triumphal cry and came back to me bringing a magnificent specimen ah bravo conseil master is very good no my boy you have made an excellent stroke take one of these living birds and carry it in your hand if master will examine it he will see that i have not deserved great merit why conseil because this bird is as drunk as a quail drunk yes sir drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the nutmegtree under which i found it see friend ned see the monstrous effects of intemperance by jove exclaimed the canadian because i have drunk gin for two months you must needs reproach me however i examined the curious bird conseil was right the bird drunk with the juice was quite powerless it could not fly it could hardly walk this bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are found in papua and in the neighbouring islands it was the large emerald bird the most rare kind it measured three feet in length its head was comparatively small its eyes placed near the opening of the beak and also small but the shades of colour were beautiful having a yellow beak brown feet and claws nutcoloured wings with purple tips pale yellow at the back of the neck and head and emerald colour at the throat chestnut on the breast and belly two horned downy nets rose from below the tail that prolonged the long light feathers of admirable fineness and they completed the whole of this marvellous bird that the natives have poetically named the bird of the sun but if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of paradise the canadians were not yet happily about two oclock ned land brought down a magnificent hog from the brood of those the natives call barioutang the animal came in time for us to procure real quadruped meat and he was well received ned land was very proud of his shot the hog hit by the electric ball fell stone dead the canadian skinned and cleaned it properly after having taken half a dozen cutlets destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the evening then the hunt was resumed which was still more marked by ned and conseils exploits indeed the two friends beating the bushes roused a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws but these animals did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could stop their course ah professor cried ned land who was carried away by the delights of the chase what excellent game and stewed too what a supply for the nautilus two three five down and to think that we shall eat that flesh and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb i think that in the excess of his joy the canadian if he had not talked so much would have killed them all but he contented himself with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians these animals were small they were a species of those kangaroo rabbits that live habitually in the hollows of trees and whose speed is extreme but they are moderately fat and furnish at least estimable food we were very satisfied with the results of the hunt happy ned proposed to return to this enchanting island the next day for he wished to depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds but he had reckoned without his host at six oclock in the evening we had regained the shore our boat was moored to the usual place the nautilus like a long rock emerged from the waves two miles from the beach ned land without waiting occupied himself about the important dinner business he understood all about cooking well the barioutang grilled on the coals soon scented the air with a delicious odour indeed the dinner was excellent two woodpigeons completed this extraordinary menu the sago pasty the artocarpus bread some mangoes half a dozen pineapples and the liquor fermented from some coconuts overjoyed us i even think that my worthy companions ideas had not all the plainness desirable suppose we do not return to the nautilus this evening said conseil suppose we never return added ned land just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooners proposition captain nemos thunderbolt we looked at the edge of the forest without rising my hand stopping in the action of putting it to my mouth ned lands completing its office stones do not fall from the sky remarked conseil or they would merit the name aerolites a second stone carefully aimed that made a savoury pigeons leg fall from conseils hand gave still more weight to his observation we all three arose shouldered our guns and were ready to reply to any attack are they apes cried ned land very nearlythey are savages to the boat i said hurrying to the sea it was indeed necessary to beat a retreat for about twenty natives armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that masked the horizon to the right hardly a hundred steps from us our boat was moored about sixty feet from us the savages approached us not running but making hostile demonstrations stones and arrows fell thickly ned land had not wished to leave his provisions and in spite of his imminent danger his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other he went tolerably fast in two minutes we were on the shore to load the boat with provisions and arms to push it out to sea and ship the oars was the work of an instant we had not gone two cablelengths when a hundred savages howling and gesticulating entered the water up to their waists i watched to see if their apparition would attract some men from the nautilus on to the platform but no the enormous machine lying off was absolutely deserted twenty minutes later we were on board the panels were open after making the boat fast we entered into the interior of the nautilus i descended to the drawingroom from whence i heard some chords captain nemo was there bending over his organ and plunged in a musical ecstasy captain he did not hear me captain i said touching his hand he shuddered and turning round said ah it is you professor well have you had a good hunt have you botanised successfully yes captain but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds whose vicinity troubles me what bipeds savages savages he echoed ironically so you are astonished professor at having set foot on a strange land and finding savages savages where are there not any besides are they worse than others these whom you call savages but captain how many have you counted a hundred at least m aronnax replied captain nemo placing his fingers on the organ stops when all the natives of papua are assembled on this shore the nautilus will have nothing to fear from their attacks the captains fingers were then running over the keys of the instrument and i remarked that he touched only the black keys which gave his melodies an essentially scotch character soon he had forgotten my presence and had plunged into a reverie that i did not disturb i went up again on to the platform night had already fallen for in this low latitude the sun sets rapidly and without twilight i could only see the island indistinctly but the numerous fires lighted on the beach showed that the natives did not think of leaving it i was alone for several hours sometimes thinking of the nativesbut without any dread of them for the imperturbable confidence of the captain was catchingsometimes forgetting them to admire the splendours of the night in the tropics my remembrances went to france in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in some hours time the moon shone in the midst of the constellations of the zenith the night slipped away without any mischance the islanders frightened no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay the panels were open and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the nautilus at six oclock in the morning of the 8th january i went up on to the platform the dawn was breaking the island soon showed itself through the dissipating fogs first the shore then the summits the natives were there more numerous than on the day beforefive or six hundred perhapssome of them profiting by the low water had come on to the coral at less than two cablelengths from the nautilus i distinguished them easily they were true papuans with athletic figures men of good race large high foreheads large but not broad and flat and white teeth their woolly hair with a reddish tinge showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the nubians from the lobes of their ears cut and distended hung chaplets of bones most of these savages were naked amongst them i remarked some women dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of herbs that sustained a vegetable waistband some chiefs had ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads red and white nearly all were armed with bows arrows and shields and carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones which they cast from their slings with great skill one of these chiefs rather near to the nautilus examined it attentively he was perhaps a mado of high rank for he was draped in a mat of bananaleaves notched round the edges and set off with brilliant colours i could easily have knocked down this native who was within a short length but i thought that it was better to wait for real hostile demonstrations between europeans and savages it is proper for the europeans to parry sharply not to attack during low water the natives roamed about near the nautilus but were not troublesome i heard them frequently repeat the word assai and by their gestures i understood that they invited me to go on land an invitation that i declined so that on that day the boat did not push off to the great displeasure of master land who could not complete his provisions this adroit canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat that he had brought off the island as for the savages they returned to the shore about eleven oclock in the morning as soon as the coral tops began to disappear under the rising tide but i saw their numbers had increased considerably on the shore probably they came from the neighbouring islands or very likely from papua however i had not seen a single native canoe having nothing better to do i thought of dragging these beautiful limpid waters under which i saw a profusion of shells zoophytes and marine plants moreover it was the last day that the nautilus would pass in these parts if it float in open sea the next day according to captain nemos promise i therefore called conseil who brought me a little light drag very like those for the oyster fishery now to work for two hours we fished unceasingly but without bringing up any rarities the drag was filled with midasears harps melames and particularly the most beautiful hammers i have ever seen we also brought up some seaslugs pearloysters and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the pantry on board but just when i expected it least i put my hand on a wonder i might say a natural deformity very rarely met with conseil was just dragging and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells when all at once he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net to draw out a shell and heard me utter a cry what is the matter sir he asked in surprise has master been bitten no my boy but i would willingly have given a finger for my discovery what discovery this shell i said holding up the object of my triumph it is simply an olive porphyry genus olive order of the pectinibranchidae class of gasteropods subclass mollusca yes conseil but instead of being rolled from right to left this olive turns from left to right is it possible yes my boy it is a left shell shells are all righthanded with rare exceptions and when by chance their spiral is left amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold conseil and i were absorbed in the contemplation of our treasure and i was promising myself to enrich the museum with it when a stone unfortunately thrown by a native struck against and broke the precious object in conseils hand i uttered a cry of despair conseil took up his gun and aimed at a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him i would have stopped him but his blow took effect and broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm of the savage conseil cried i conseil well sir do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack a shell is not worth the life of a man said i ah the scoundrel cried conseil i would rather he had broken my shoulder conseil was in earnest but i was not of his opinion however the situation had changed some minutes before and we had not perceived a score of canoes surrounded the nautilus these canoes scooped out of the trunk of a tree long narrow well adapted for speed were balanced by means of a long bamboo pole which floated on the water they were managed by skilful halfnaked paddlers and i watched their advance with some uneasiness it was evident that these papuans had already had dealings with the europeans and knew their ships but this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay without masts or chimneys what could they think of it nothing good for at first they kept at a respectful distance however seeing it motionless by degrees they took courage and sought to familiarise themselves with it now this familiarity was precisely what it was necessary to avoid our arms which were noiseless could only produce a moderate effect on the savages who have little respect for aught but blustering things the thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man but little though the danger lies in the lightning not in the noise at this moment the canoes approached the nautilus and a shower of arrows alighted on her i went down to the saloon but found no one there i ventured to knock at the door that opened into the captains room come in was the answer i entered and found captain nemo deep in algebraical calculations of _x_ and other quantities i am disturbing you said i for courtesys sake that is true m aronnax replied the captain but i think you have serious reasons for wishing to see me very grave ones the natives are surrounding us in their canoes and in a few minutes we shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of savages ah said captain nemo quietly they are come with their canoes yes sir well sir we must close the hatches exactly and i came to say to you nothing can be more simple said captain nemo and pressing an electric button he transmitted an order to the ships crew it is all done sir said he after some moments the pinnace is ready and the hatches are closed you do not fear i imagine that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect no captain but a danger still exists what is that sir it is that tomorrow at about this hour we must open the hatches to renew the air of the nautilus now if at this moment the papuans should occupy the platform i do not see how you could prevent them from entering then sir you suppose that they will board us i am certain of it well sir let them come i see no reason for hindering them after all these papuans are poor creatures and i am unwilling that my visit to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches upon that i was going away but captain nemo detained me and asked me to sit down by him he questioned me with interest about our excursions on shore and our hunting and seemed not to understand the craving for meat that possessed the canadian then the conversation turned on various subjects and without being more communicative captain nemo showed himself more amiable amongst other things we happened to speak of the situation of the nautilus run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait where dumont durville was nearly lost apropos of this this durville was one of your great sailors said the captain to me one of your most intelligent navigators he is the captain cook of you frenchmen unfortunate man of science after having braved the icebergs of the south pole the coral reefs of oceania the cannibals of the pacific to perish miserably in a railway train if this energetic man could have reflected during the last moments of his life what must have been uppermost in his last thoughts do you suppose so speaking captain nemo seemed moved and his emotion gave me a better opinion of him then chart in hand we reviewed the travels of the french navigator his voyages of circumnavigation his double detention at the south pole which led to the discovery of adelaide and louis philippe and fixing the hydrographical bearings of the principal islands of oceania that which your durville has done on the surface of the seas said captain nemo that have i done under them and more easily more completely than he the astrolabe and the zelee incessantly tossed about by the hurricane could not be worth the nautilus quiet repository of labour that she is truly motionless in the midst of the waters tomorrow added the captain rising tomorrow at twenty minutes to three pm the nautilus shall float and leave the strait of torres uninjured having curtly pronounced these words captain nemo bowed slightly this was to dismiss me and i went back to my room there i found conseil who wished to know the result of my interview with the captain my boy said i when i feigned to believe that his nautilus was threatened by the natives of papua the captain answered me very sarcastically i have but one thing to say to you have confidence in him and go to sleep in peace have you no need of my services sir no my friend what is ned land doing if you will excuse me sir answered conseil friend ned is busy making a kangaroopie which will be a marvel i remained alone and went to bed but slept indifferently i heard the noise of the savages who stamped on the platform uttering deafening cries the night passed thus without disturbing the ordinary repose of the crew the presence of these cannibals affected them no more than the soldiers of a masked battery care for the ants that crawl over its front at six in the morning i rose the hatches had not been opened the inner air was not renewed but the reservoirs filled ready for any emergency were now resorted to and discharged several cubic feet of oxygen into the exhausted atmosphere of the nautilus i worked in my room till noon without having seen captain nemo even for an instant on board no preparations for departure were visible i waited still some time then went into the large saloon the clock marked halfpast two in ten minutes it would be hightide and if captain nemo had not made a rash promise the nautilus would be immediately detached if not many months would pass ere she could leave her bed of coral however some warning vibrations began to be felt in the vessel i heard the keel grating against the rough calcareous bottom of the coral reef at fiveandtwenty minutes to three captain nemo appeared in the saloon we are going to start said he ah replied i i have given the order to open the hatches and the papuans the papuans answered captain nemo slightly shrugging his shoulders will they not come inside the nautilus how only by leaping over the hatches you have opened m aronnax quietly answered captain nemo they will not enter the hatches of the nautilus in that way even if they were open i looked at the captain you do not understand said he hardly well come and you will see i directed my steps towards the central staircase there ned land and conseil were slyly watching some of the ships crew who were opening the hatches while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded outside the port lids were pulled down outside twenty horrible faces appeared but the first native who placed his hand on the stairrail struck from behind by some invisible force i know not what fled uttering the most fearful cries and making the wildest contortions ten of his companions followed him they met with the same fate conseil was in ecstasy ned land carried away by his violent instincts rushed on to the staircase but the moment he seized the rail with both hands he in his turn was overthrown i am struck by a thunderbolt cried he with an oath this explained all it was no rail but a metallic cable charged with electricity from the deck communicating with the platform whoever touched it felt a powerful shockand this shock would have been mortal if captain nemo had discharged into the conductor the whole force of the current it might truly be said that between his assailants and himself he had stretched a network of electricity which none could pass with impunity meanwhile the exasperated papuans had beaten a retreat paralysed with terror as for us half laughing we consoled and rubbed the unfortunate ned land who swore like one possessed but at this moment the nautilus raised by the last waves of the tide quitted her coral bed exactly at the fortieth minute fixed by the captain her screw swept the waters slowly and majestically her speed increased gradually and sailing on the surface of the ocean she quitted safe and sound the dangerous passes of the straits of torres the coral kingdom the next day i woke with my head singularly clear to my great surprise i was in my own room my companions no doubt had been reinstated in their cabin without having perceived it any more than i of what had passed during the night they were as ignorant as i was and to penetrate this mystery i only reckoned upon the chances of the future i then thought of quitting my room was i free again or a prisoner quite free i opened the door went to the halfdeck went up the central stairs the panels shut the evening before were open i went on to the platform ned land and conseil waited there for me i questioned them they knew nothing lost in a heavy sleep in which they had been totally unconscious they had been astonished at finding themselves in their cabin as for the nautilus it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever it floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace nothing seemed changed on board the second lieutenant then came on to the platform and gave the usual order below as for captain nemo he did not appear of the people on board i only saw the impassive steward who served me with his usual dumb regularity about two oclock i was in the drawingroom busied in arranging my notes when the captain opened the door and appeared i bowed he made a slight inclination in return without speaking i resumed my work hoping that he would perhaps give me some explanation of the events of the preceding night he made none i looked at him he seemed fatigued his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep his face looked very sorrowful he walked to and fro sat down and got up again took a chance book put it down consulted his instruments without taking his habitual notes and seemed restless and uneasy at last he came up to me and said are you a doctor m aronnax i so little expected such a question that i stared some time at him without answering are you a doctor he repeated several of your colleagues have studied medicine well said i i am a doctor and resident surgeon to the hospital i practised several years before entering the museum very well sir my answer had evidently satisfied the captain but not knowing what he would say next i waited for other questions reserving my answers according to circumstances m aronnax will you consent to prescribe for one of my men he asked is he ill yes i am ready to follow you come then i own my heart beat i do not know why i saw certain connection between the illness of one of the crew and the events of the day before and this mystery interested me at least as much as the sick man captain nemo conducted me to the poop of the nautilus and took me into a cabin situated near the sailors quarters there on a bed lay a man about forty years of age with a resolute expression of countenance a true type of an anglosaxon i leant over him he was not only ill he was wounded his head swathed in bandages covered with blood lay on a pillow i undid the bandages and the wounded man looked at me with his large eyes and gave no sign of pain as i did it it was a horrible wound the skull shattered by some deadly weapon left the brain exposed which was much injured clots of blood had formed in the bruised and broken mass in colour like the dregs of wine there was both contusion and suffusion of the brain his breathing was slow and some spasmodic movements of the muscles agitated his face i felt his pulse it was intermittent the extremities of the body were growing cold already and i saw death must inevitably ensue after dressing the unfortunate mans wounds i readjusted the bandages on his head and turned to captain nemo what caused this wound i asked what does it signify he replied evasively a shock has broken one of the levers of the engine which struck myself but your opinion as to his state i hesitated before giving it you may speak said the captain this man does not understand french i gave a last look at the wounded man he will be dead in two hours can nothing save him nothing captain nemos hand contracted and some tears glistened in his eyes which i thought incapable of shedding any for some moments i still watched the dying man whose life ebbed slowly his pallor increased under the electric light that was shed over his deathbed i looked at his intelligent forehead furrowed with premature wrinkles produced probably by misfortune and sorrow i tried to learn the secret of his life from the last words that escaped his lips you can go now m aronnax said the captain i left him in the dying mans cabin and returned to my room much affected by this scene during the whole day i was haunted by uncomfortable suspicions and at night i slept badly and between my broken dreams i fancied i heard distant sighs like the notes of a funeral psalm were they the prayers of the dead murmured in that language that i could not understand the next morning i went on to the bridge captain nemo was there before me as soon as he perceived me he came to me professor will it be convenient to you to make a submarine excursion today with my companions i asked if they like we obey your orders captain will you be so good then as to put on your cork jackets it was not a question of dead or dying i rejoined ned land and conseil and told them of captain nemos proposition conseil hastened to accept it and this time the canadian seemed quite willing to follow our example it was eight oclock in the morning at halfpast eight we were equipped for this new excursion and provided with two contrivances for light and breathing the double door was open and accompanied by captain nemo who was followed by a dozen of the crew we set foot at a depth of about thirty feet on the solid bottom on which the nautilus rested a slight declivity ended in an uneven bottom at fifteen fathoms depth this bottom differed entirely from the one i had visited on my first excursion under the waters of the pacific ocean here there was no fine sand no submarine prairies no seaforest i immediately recognised that marvellous region in which on that day the captain did the honours to us it was the coral kingdom the light produced a thousand charming varieties playing in the midst of the branches that were so vividly coloured i seemed to see the membraneous and cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the undulation of the waters i was tempted to gather their fresh petals ornamented with delicate tentacles some just blown the others budding while a small fish swimming swiftly touched them slightly like flights of birds but if my hand approached these living flowers these animated sensitive plants the whole colony took alarm the white petals reentered their red cases the flowers faded as i looked and the bush changed into a block of stony knobs chance had thrown me just by the most precious specimens of the zoophyte this coral was more valuable than that found in the mediterranean on the coasts of france italy and barbary its tints justified the poetical names of flower of blood and froth of blood that trade has given to its most beautiful productions coral is sold for l20 per ounce and in this place the watery beds would make the fortunes of a company of coraldivers this precious matter often confused with other polypi formed then the inextricable plots called macciota and on which i noticed several beautiful specimens of pink coral but soon the bushes contract and the arborisations increase real petrified thickets long joints of fantastic architecture were disclosed before us captain nemo placed himself under a dark gallery where by a slight declivity we reached a depth of a hundred yards the light from our lamps produced sometimes magical effects following the rough outlines of the natural arches and pendants disposed like lustres that were tipped with points of fire at last after walking two hours we had attained a depth of about three hundred yards that is to say the extreme limit on which coral begins to form but there was no isolated bush nor modest brushwood at the bottom of lofty trees it was an immense forest of large mineral vegetations enormous petrified trees united by garlands of elegant seabindweed all adorned with clouds and reflections we passed freely under their high branches lost in the shade of the waves captain nemo had stopped i and my companions halted and turning round i saw his men were forming a semicircle round their chief watching attentively i observed that four of them carried on their shoulders an object of an oblong shape we occupied in this place the centre of a vast glade surrounded by the lofty foliage of the submarine forest our lamps threw over this place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on the ground at the end of the glade the darkness increased and was only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral ned land and conseil were near me we watched and i thought i was going to witness a strange scene on observing the ground i saw that it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with limy deposits and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of man in the midst of the glade on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have thought were made of petrified blood upon a sign from captain nemo one of the men advanced and at some feet from the cross he began to dig a hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt i understood all this glade was a cemetery this hole a tomb this oblong object the body of the man who had died in the night the captain and his men had come to bury their companion in this general restingplace at the bottom of this inaccessible ocean the grave was being dug slowly the fish fled on all sides while their retreat was being thus disturbed i heard the strokes of the pickaxe which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the waters the hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body then the bearers approached the body enveloped in a tissue of white linen was lowered into the damp grave captain nemo with his arms crossed on his breast and all the friends of him who had loved them knelt in prayer the grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground which formed a slight mound when this was done captain nemo and his men rose then approaching the grave they knelt again and all extended their hands in sign of a last adieu then the funeral procession returned to the nautilus passing under the arches of the forest in the midst of thickets along the coral bushes and still on the ascent at last the light of the ship appeared and its luminous track guided us to the nautilus at one oclock we had returned as soon as i had changed my clothes i went up on to the platform and a prey to conflicting emotions i sat down near the binnacle captain nemo joined me i rose and said to him so as i said he would this man died in the night yes m aronnax and he rests now near his companions in the coral cemetery yes forgotten by all else but not by us we dug the grave and the polypi undertake to seal our dead for eternity and burying his face quickly in his hands he tried in vain to suppress a sob then he added our peaceful cemetery is there some hundred feet below the surface of the waves your dead sleep quietly at least captain out of the reach of sharks yes sir of sharks and men gravely replied the captain part two the coral kingdom the next day i woke with my head singularly clear to my great surprise i was in my own room my companions no doubt had been reinstated in their cabin without having

sharks and men gravely replied the captain part two the indian ocean we now come to the second part of our journey under the sea the first ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a deep impression on my mind thus in the midst of this great sea captain nemos life was passing even to his grave which he had prepared in one of its deepest abysses there not one of the oceans monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the nautilus of those friends riveted to each other in death as in life nor any man either had added the captain still the same fierce implacable defiance towards human society i could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied conseil that worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the commander of the nautilus one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for indifference for him he was a misunderstood genius who tired of earths deceptions had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium where he might follow his instincts freely to my mind this explains but one side of captain nemos character indeed the mystery of that last night during which we had been chained in prison the sleep and the precaution so violently taken by the captain of snatching from my eyes the glass i had raised to sweep the horizon the mortal wound of the man due to an unaccountable shock of the nautilus all put me on a new track no captain nemo was not satisfied with shunning man his formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom but perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation at this moment nothing is clear to me i catch but a glimpse of light amidst all the darkness and i must confine myself to writing as events shall dictate that day the 24th of january 1868 at noon the second officer came to take the altitude of the sun i mounted the platform lit a cigar and watched the operation it seemed to me that the man did not understand french for several times i made remarks in a loud voice which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention if he had understood them but he remained undisturbed and dumb as he was taking observations with the sextant one of the sailors of the nautilus the strong man who had accompanied us on our first submarine excursion to the island of crespo came to clean the glasses of the lantern i examined the fittings of the apparatus the strength of which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings placed similar to those in a lighthouse and which projected their brilliance in a horizontal plane the electric lamp was combined in such a way as to give its most powerful light indeed it was produced in vacuo which insured both its steadiness and its intensity this vacuum economised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was developedan important point of economy for captain nemo who could not easily have replaced them and under these conditions their waste was imperceptible when the nautilus was ready to continue its submarine journey i went down to the saloon the panel was closed and the course marked direct west we were furrowing the waters of the indian ocean a vast liquid plain with a surface of 1200000000 of acres and whose waters are so clear and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy the nautilus usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep we went on so for some days to anyone but myself who had a great love for the sea the hours would have seemed long and monotonous but the daily walks on the platform when i steeped myself in the reviving air of the ocean the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the saloon the books in the library the compiling of my memoirs took up all my time and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness for some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds seamews or gulls some were cleverly killed and prepared in a certain way made very acceptable watergame amongst largewinged birds carried a long distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of their flight i saw some magnificent albatrosses uttering discordant cries like the braying of an ass and birds belonging to the family of the longwings as to the fish they always provoked our admiration when we surprised the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels i saw many kinds which i never before had a chance of observing i shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the red sea the indian ocean and that part which washes the coast of tropical america these fishes like the tortoise the armadillo the seahedgehog and the crustacea are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor stony but real bone in some it takes the form of a solid triangle in others of a solid quadrangle amongst the triangular i saw some an inch and a half in length with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour they are brown at the tail and yellow at the fins and i recommend their introduction into fresh water to which a certain number of seafish easily accustom themselves i would also mention quadrangular ostracions having on the back four large tubercles some dotted over with white spots on the lower part of the body and which may be tamed like birds trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of their bony shell and which from their strange gruntings are called seapigs also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone whose flesh is very tough and leathery i now borrow from the daily notes of master conseil certain fish of the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas with red backs and white chests which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal filaments and some electrical seven inches long decked in the liveliest colours then as specimens of other kinds some ovoides resembling an egg of a dark brown colour marked with white bands and without tails diodons real seaporcupines furnished with spikes and capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling with darts hippocampi common to every ocean some pegasi with lengthened snouts which their pectoral fins being much elongated and formed in the shape of wings allow if not to fly at least to shoot into the air pigeon spatulae with tails covered with many rings of shell macrognathi with long jaws an excellent fish nine inches long and bright with most agreeable colours palecoloured calliomores with rugged heads and plenty of chaetpdons with long and tubular muzzles which kill insects by shooting them as from an airgun with a single drop of water these we may call the flycatchers of the seas in the eightyninth genus of fishes classed by lacepede belonging to the second lower class of bony characterised by opercules and bronchial membranes i remarked the scorpaena the head of which is furnished with spikes and which has but one dorsal fin these creatures are covered or not with little shells according to the subclass to which they belong the second subclass gives us specimens of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length with yellow rays and heads of a most fantastic appearance as to the first subclass it gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately called a seafrog with large head sometimes pierced with holes sometimes swollen with protuberances bristling with spikes and covered with tubercles it has irregular and hideous horns its body and tail are covered with callosities its sting makes a dangerous wound it is both repugnant and horrible to look at from the 21st to the 23rd of january the nautilus went at the rate of two hundred and fifty leagues in twentyfour hours being five hundred and forty miles or twentytwo miles an hour if we recognised so many different varieties of fish it was because attracted by the electric light they tried to follow us the greater part however were soon distanced by our speed though some kept their place in the waters of the nautilus for a time the morning of the 24th in 12 deg 5 s lat and 94 deg 33 long we observed keeling island a coral formation planted with magnificent cocos and which had been visited by mr darwin and captain fitzroy the nautilus skirted the shores of this desert island for a little distance its nets brought up numerous specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca some precious productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of captain nemo to which i added an astraea punctifera a kind of parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell soon keeling island disappeared from the horizon and our course was directed to the northwest in the direction of the indian peninsula from keeling island our course was slower and more variable often taking us into great depths several times they made use of the inclined planes which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the waterline in that way we went about two miles but without ever obtaining the greatest depths of the indian sea which soundings of seven thousand fathoms have never reached as to the temperature of the lower strata the thermometer invariably indicated 4 deg above zero i only observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea on the 25th of january the ocean was entirely deserted the nautilus passed the day on the surface beating the waves with its powerful screw and making them rebound to a great height who under such circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean three parts of this day i spent on the platform i watched the sea nothing on the horizon till about four oclock a steamer running west on our counter her masts were visible for an instant but she could not see the nautilus being too low in the water i fancied this steamboat belonged to the po company which runs from ceylon to sydney touching at king georges point and melbourne at five oclock in the evening before that fleeting twilight which binds night to day in tropical zones conseil and i were astonished by a curious spectacle it was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the ocean we could count several hundreds they belonged to the tubercle kind which are peculiar to the indian seas these graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive tube through which they propelled the water already drawn in of their eight tentacles six were elongated and stretched out floating on the water whilst the other two rolled up flat were spread to the wing like a light sail i saw their spiralshaped and fluted shells which cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff a boat indeed it bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it for nearly an hour the nautilus floated in the midst of this shoal of molluscs then i know not what sudden fright they took but as if at a signal every sail was furled the arms folded the body drawn in the shells turned over changing their centre of gravity and the whole fleet disappeared under the waves never did the ships of a squadron manoeuvre with more unity at that moment night fell suddenly and the reeds scarcely raised by the breeze lay peaceably under the sides of the nautilus the next day 26th of january we cut the equator at the eightysecond meridian and entered the northern hemisphere during the day a formidable troop of sharks accompanied us terrible creatures which multiply in these seas and make them very dangerous they were cestracio philippi sharks with brown backs and whitish bellies armed with eleven rows of teetheyed sharkstheir throat being marked with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye there were also some isabella sharks with rounded snouts marked with dark spots these powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the saloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure at such times ned land was no longer master of himself he wanted to go to the surface and harpoon the monsters particularly certain smoothhound sharks whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic and large tigersharks nearly six yards long the last named of which seemed to excite him more particularly but the nautilus accelerating her speed easily left the most rapid of them behind the 27th of january at the entrance of the vast bay of bengal we met repeatedly a forbidding spectacle dead bodies floating on the surface of the water they were the dead of the indian villages carried by the ganges to the level of the sea and which the vultures the only undertakers of the country had not been able to devour but the sharks did not fail to help them at their funeral work about seven oclock in the evening the nautilus halfimmersed was sailing in a sea of milk at first sight the ocean seemed lactified was it the effect of the lunar rays no for the moon scarcely two days old was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the sun the whole sky though lit by the sidereal rays seemed black by contrast with the whiteness of the waters conseil could not believe his eyes and questioned me as to the cause of this strange phenomenon happily i was able to answer him it is called a milk sea i explained a large extent of white wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of amboyna and in these parts of the sea but sir said conseil can you tell me what causes such an effect for i suppose the water is not really turned into milk no my boy and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by the presence of myriads of infusoria a sort of luminous little worm gelatinous and without colour of the thickness of a hair and whose length is not more than seventhousandths of an inch these insects adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues several leagues exclaimed conseil yes my boy and you need not try to compute the number of these infusoria you will not be able for if i am not mistaken ships have floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour but behind us even to the limits of the horizon the sky reflected the whitened waves and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague glimmerings of an aurora borealis a novel proposal of captain nemos on the 28th of february when at noon the nautilus came to the surface of the sea in 9 deg 4 n lat there was land in sight about eight miles to westward the first thing i noticed was a range of mountains about two thousand feet high the shapes of which were most capricious on taking the bearings i knew that we were nearing the island of ceylon the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the indian peninsula captain nemo and his second appeared at this moment the captain glanced at the map then turning to me said the island of ceylon noted for its pearlfisheries would you like to visit one of them m aronnax certainly captain well the thing is easy though if we see the fisheries we shall not see the fishermen the annual exportation has not yet begun never mind i will give orders to make for the gulf of manaar where we shall arrive in the night the captain said something to his second who immediately went out soon the nautilus returned to her native element and the manometer showed that she was about thirty feet deep well sir said captain nemo you and your companions shall visit the bank of manaar and if by chance some fisherman should be there we shall see him at work agreed captain by the bye m aronnax you are not afraid of sharks sharks exclaimed i this question seemed a very hard one well continued captain nemo i admit captain that i am not yet very familiar with that kind of fish we are accustomed to them replied captain nemo and in time you will be too however we shall be armed and on the road we may be able to hunt some of the tribe it is interesting so till tomorrow sir and early this said in a careless tone captain nemo left the saloon now if you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of switzerland what would you say very well tomorrow we will go and hunt the bear if you were asked to hunt the lion in the plains of atlas or the tiger in the indian jungles what would you say ha ha it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion but when you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element you would perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation as for myself i passed my hand over my forehead on which stood large drops of cold perspiration let us reflect said i and take our time hunting otters in submarine forests as we did in the island of crespo will pass but going up and down at the bottom of the sea where one is almost certain to meet sharks is quite another thing i know well that in certain countries particularly in the andaman islands the negroes never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a running noose in the other but i also know that few who affront those creatures ever return alive however i am not a negro and if i were i think a little hesitation in this case would not be illtimed at this moment conseil and the canadian entered quite composed and even joyous they knew not what awaited them faith sir said ned land your captain nemothe devil take himhas just made us a very pleasant offer ah said i you know if agreeable to you sir interrupted conseil the commander of the nautilus has invited us to visit the magnificent ceylon fisheries tomorrow in your company he did it kindly and behaved like a real gentleman he said nothing more nothing more sir except that he had already spoken to you of this little walk sir said conseil would you give us some details of the pearl fishery as to the fishing itself i asked or the incidents which on the fishing replied the canadian before entering upon the ground it is as well to know something about it very well sit down my friends and i will teach you ned and conseil seated themselves on an ottoman and the first thing the canadian asked was sir what is a pearl my worthy ned i answered to the poet a pearl is a tear of the sea to the orientals it is a drop of dew solidified to the ladies it is a jewel of an oblong shape of a brilliancy of motherofpearl substance which they wear on their fingers their necks or their ears for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of lime with a little gelatine and lastly for naturalists it is simply a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the motherofpearl amongst certain bivalves branch of molluscs said conseil precisely so my learned conseil and amongst these testacea the earshell the tridacnae the turbots in a word all those which secrete motherofpearl that is the blue bluish violet or white substance which lines the interior of their shells are capable of producing pearls mussels too asked the canadian yes mussels of certain waters in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france good for the future i shall pay attention replied the canadian but i continued the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is the pearloyster the meleagrina margaritiferct that precious pintadine the pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation deposited in a globular form either adhering to the oyster shell or buried in the folds of the creature on the shell it is fast in the flesh it is loose but always has for a kernel a small hard substance may be a barren egg may be a grain of sand around which the pearly matter deposits itself year after year successively and by thin concentric layers are many pearls found in the same oyster asked conseil yes my boy some are a perfect casket one oyster has been mentioned though i allow myself to doubt it as having contained no less than a hundred and fifty sharks a hundred and fifty sharks exclaimed ned land did i say sharks said i hurriedly i meant to say a hundred and fifty pearls sharks would not be sense certainly not said conseil but will you tell us now by what means they extract these pearls they proceed in various ways when they adhere to the shell the fishermen often pull them off with pincers but the most common way is to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks thus they die in the open air and at the end of ten days they are in a forward state of decomposition they are then plunged into large reservoirs of seawater then they are opened and washed the price of these pearls varies according to their size asked conseil not only according to their size i answered but also according to their shape their water that is their colour and their lustre that is that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming to the eye the most beautiful are called virgin pearls or paragons they are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc are white often opaque and sometimes have the transparency of an opal they are generally round or oval the round are made into bracelets the oval into pendants and being more precious are sold singly those adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape and are sold by weight lastly in a lower order are classed those small pearls known under the name of seedpearls they are sold by measure and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments but said conseil is this pearlfishery dangerous no i answered quickly particularly if certain precautions are taken what does one risk in such a calling said ned land the swallowing of some mouthfuls of seawater as you say ned by the bye said i trying to take captain nemos careless tone are you afraid of sharks brave ned i replied the canadian a harpooner by profession it is my trade to make light of them but said i it is not a question of fishing for them with an ironswivel hoisting them into the vessel cutting off their tails with a blow of a chopper ripping them up and throwing their heart into the sea then it is a question of precisely in the water in the water faith with a good harpoon you know sir these sharks are illfashioned beasts they turn on their bellies to seize you and in that time ned land had a way of saying seize which made my blood run cold well and you conseil what do you think of sharks me said conseil i will be frank sir so much the better thought i if you sir mean to face the sharks i do not see why your faithful servant should not face them with you a pearl of ten millions the next morning at four oclock i was awakened by the steward whom captain nemo had placed at my service i rose hurriedly dressed and went into the saloon captain nemo was awaiting me m aronnax said he are you ready to start i am ready then please to follow me and my companions captain they have been told and are waiting are we not to put on our divers dresses asked i not yet i have not allowed the nautilus to come too near this coast and we are some distance from the manaar bank but the boat is ready and will take us to the exact point of disembarking which will save us a long way it carries our diving apparatus which we will put on when we begin our submarine journey captain nemo conducted me to the central staircase which led on the platform ned and conseil were already there delighted at the idea of the pleasure party which was preparing five sailors from the nautilus with their oars waited in the boat which had been made fast against the side the night was still dark layers of clouds covered the sky allowing but few stars to be seen i looked on the side where the land lay and saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon from southwest to north west the nautilus having returned during the night up the western coast of ceylon was now west of the bay or rather gulf formed by the mainland and the island of manaar there under the dark waters stretched the pintadine bank an inexhaustible field of pearls the length of which is more than twenty miles captain nemo ned land conseil and i took our places in the stern of the boat the master went to the tiller his four companions leaned on their oars the painter was cast off and we sheered off the boat went towards the south the oarsmen did not hurry i noticed that their strokes strong in the water only followed each other every ten seconds according to the method generally adopted in the navy whilst the craft was running by its own velocity the liquid drops struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead a little billow spreading wide gave a slight roll to the boat and some samphire reeds flapped before it we were silent what was captain nemo thinking of perhaps of the land he was approaching and which he found too near to him contrary to the canadians opinion who thought it too far off as to conseil he was merely there from curiosity about halfpast five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper line of coast more distinctly flat enough in the east it rose a little to the south five miles still lay between us and it was indistinct owing to the mist on the water at six oclock it became suddenly daylight with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions which know neither dawn nor twilight the solar rays pierced the curtain of clouds piled up on the eastern horizon and the radiant orb rose rapidly i saw land distinctly with a few trees scattered here and there the boat neared manaar island which was rounded to the south captain nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea at a sign from him the anchor was dropped but the chain scarcely ran for it was little more than a yard deep and this spot was one of the highest points of the bank of pintadines here we are m aronnax said captain nemo you see that enclosed bay here in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of the exporters and these are the waters their divers will ransack so boldly happily this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing it is sheltered from the strongest winds the sea is never very rough here which makes it favourable for the divers work we will now put on our dresses and begin our walk i did not answer and while watching the suspected waves began with the help of the sailors to put on my heavy seadress captain nemo and my companions were also dressing none of the nautilus men were to accompany us on this new excursion soon we were enveloped to the throat in indiarubber clothing the air apparatus fixed to our backs by braces as to the ruhmkorff apparatus there was no necessity for it before putting my head into the copper cap i had asked the question of the captain they would be useless he replied we are going to no great depth and the solar rays will be enough to light our walk besides it would not be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters its brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast most inopportunely as captain nemo pronounced these words i turned to conseil and ned land but my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal cap and they could neither hear nor answer one last question remained to ask of captain nemo and our arms asked i our guns guns what for do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in their hand and is not steel surer than lead here is a strong blade put it in your belt and we start i looked at my companions they were armed like us and more than that ned land was brandishing an enormous harpoon which he had placed in the boat before leaving the nautilus then following the captains example i allowed myself to be dressed in the heavy copper helmet and our reservoirs of air were at once in activity an instant after we were landed one after the other in about two yards of water upon an even sand captain nemo made a sign with his hand and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we disappeared under the waves over our feet like coveys of snipe in a bog rose shoals of fish of the genus monoptera which have no other fins but their tail i recognized the javanese a real serpent two and a half feet long of a livid colour underneath and which might easily be mistaken for a conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side in the genus stromateus whose bodies are very flat and oval i saw some of the most brilliant colours carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe an excellent eating fish which dried and pickled is known by the name of karawade then some tranquebars belonging to the genus apsiphoroides whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight longitudinal plates the heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more the soil changed by degrees to the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of boulders covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes amongst the specimens of these branches i noticed some placenae with thin unequal shells a kind of ostracion peculiar to the red sea and the indian ocean some orange lucinae with rounded shells rockfish three feet and a half long which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready to seize one there were also some panopyres slightly luminous and lastly some oculines like magnificent fans forming one of the richest vegetations of these seas in the midst of these living plants and under the arbours of the hydrophytes were layers of clumsy articulates particularly some raninae whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle and some horrible looking parthenopes at about seven oclock we found ourselves at last surveying the oysterbanks on which the pearloysters are reproduced by millions captain nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters and i could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible for natures creative power is far beyond mans instinct of destruction ned land faithful to his instinct hastened to fill a net which he carried by his side with some of the finest specimens but we could not stop we must follow the captain who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself the ground was sensibly rising and sometimes on holding up my arm it was above the surface of the sea then the level of the bank would sink capriciously often we rounded high rocks scarped into pyramids in their dark fractures huge crustacea perched upon their high claws like some warmachine watched us with fixed eyes and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides at this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora at first it seemed very dark to me the solar rays seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations until its vague transparency became nothing more than drowned light captain nemo entered we followed my eyes soon accustomed themselves to this relative state of darkness i could distinguish the arches springing capriciously from natural pillars standing broad upon their granite base like the heavy columns of tuscan architecture why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt i was soon to know after descending a rather sharp declivity our feet trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit there captain nemo stopped and with his hand indicated an object i had not yet perceived it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions a gigantic tridacne a goblet which could have contained a whole lake of holywater a basin the breadth of which was more than two yards and a half and consequently larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the nautilus i approached this extraordinary mollusc it adhered by its filaments to a table of granite and there isolated it developed itself in the calm waters of the grotto i estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lb such an oyster would contain 30 lb of meat and one must have the stomach of a gargantua to demolish some dozens of them captain nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this bivalve and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual state of this tridacne the shells were a little open the captain came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing then with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges which formed a cloak for the creature there between the folded plaits i saw a loose pearl whose size equalled that of a coconut its globular shape perfect clearness and admirable lustre made it altogether a jewel of inestimable value carried away by my curiosity i stretched out my hand to seize it weigh it and touch it but the captain stopped me made a sign of refusal and quickly withdrew his dagger and the two shells closed suddenly i then understood captain nemos intention in leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowing it to grow slowly each year the secretions of the mollusc would add new concentric circles i estimated its value at l500000 at least after ten minutes captain nemo stopped suddenly i thought he had halted previously to returning no by a gesture he bade us crouch beside him in a deep fracture of the rock his hand pointed to one part of the liquid mass which i watched attentively about five yards from me a shadow appeared and sank to the ground the disquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind but i was mistaken and once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had anything to do with it was a man a living man an indian a fisherman a poor devil who i suppose had come to glean before the harvest i could see the bottom of his canoe anchored some feet above his head he dived and went up successively a stone held between his feet cut in the shape of a sugar loaf whilst a rope fastened him to his boat helped him to descend more rapidly this was all his apparatus reaching the bottom about five yards deep he went on his knees and filled his bag with oysters picked up at random then he went up emptied it pulled up his stone and began the operation once more which lasted thirty seconds the diver did not see us the shadow of the rock hid us from sight and how should this poor indian ever dream that men beings like himself should be there under the water watching his movements and losing no detail of the fishing several times he went up in this way and dived again he did not carry away more than ten at each plunge for he was obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by means of their strong byssus and how many of those oysters for which he risked his life had no pearl in them i watched him closely his manoeuvres were regular and for the space of half an hour no danger appeared to threaten him i was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting fishing when suddenly as the indian was on the ground i saw him make a gesture of terror rise and make a spring to return to the surface of the sea i understood his dread a gigantic shadow appeared just above the unfortunate diver it was a shark of enormous size advancing diagonally his eyes on fire and his jaws open i was mute with horror and unable to move the voracious creature shot towards the indian who threw himself on one side to avoid the sharks fins but not its tail for it struck his chest and stretched him on the ground this scene lasted but a few seconds the shark returned and turning on his back prepared himself for cutting the indian in two when i saw captain nemo rise suddenly and then dagger in hand walk straight to the monster ready to fight face to face with him the very moment the shark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two he perceived his new adversary and turning over made straight towards him i can still see captain nemos position holding himself well together he waited for the shark with admirable coolness and when it rushed at him threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness avoiding the shock and burying his dagger deep into its side but it was not all over a terrible combat ensued the shark had seemed to roar if i might say so the blood rushed in torrents from its wound the sea was dyed red and through the opaque liquid i could distinguish nothing more nothing more until the moment when like lightning i saw the undaunted captain hanging on to one of the creatures fins struggling as it were hand to hand with the monster and dealing successive blows at his enemy yet still unable to give a decisive one the sharks struggles agitated the water with such fury that the rocking threatened to upset me i wanted to go to the captains assistance but nailed to the spot with horror i could not stir i saw the haggard eye i saw the different phases of the fight the captain fell to the earth upset by the enormous mass which leant upon him the sharks jaws opened wide like a pair of factory shears and it would have been all over with the captain but quick as thought harpoon in hand ned land rushed towards the shark and struck it with its sharp point the waves were impregnated with a mass of blood they rocked under the sharks movements which beat them with indescribable fury ned land had not missed his aim it was the monsters deathrattle struck to the heart it struggled in dreadful convulsions the shock of which overthrew conseil but ned land had disentangled the captain who getting up without any wound went straight to the indian quickly cut the cord which held him to his stone took him in his arms and with a sharp blow of his heel mounted to the surface we all three followed in a few seconds saved by a miracle and reached the fishermans boat captain nemos first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life again i did not think he could succeed i hoped so for the poor creatures immersion was not long but the blow from the sharks tail might have been his deathblow happily with the captains and conseils sharp friction i saw consciousness return by degrees he opened his eyes what was his surprise his terror even at seeing four great copper heads leaning over him and above all what must he have thought when captain nemo drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls placed it in his hand this munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand his wondering eyes showed that he knew not to what superhuman beings he owed both fortune and life at a sign from the captain we regained the bank and following the road already traversed came in about half an hour to the anchor which held the canoe of the nautilus to the earth once on board we each with the help of the sailors got rid of the heavy copper helmet captain nemos first word was to the canadian thank you master land said he it was in revenge captain replied ned land i owed you that a ghastly smile passed across the captains lips and that was all to the nautilus said he the boat flew over the waves some minutes after we met the sharks dead body floating by the black marking of the extremity of its fins i recognised the terrible melanopteron of the indian seas of the species of shark so properly called it was more than twentyfive feet long its enormous mouth occupied onethird of its body it was an adult as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles triangle in the upper jaw whilst i was contemplating this inert mass a dozen of these voracious beasts appeared round the boat and without noticing us threw themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the pieces at halfpast eight we were again on board the nautilus there i reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to the manaar bank two conclusions i must inevitably draw from itone bearing upon the unparalleled courage of captain nemo the other upon his devotion to a human being a representative of that race from which he fled beneath the sea whatever he might say this strange man had not yet succeeded in entirely crushing his heart when i made this observation to him he answered in a slightly moved tone that indian sir is an inhabitant of an oppressed country and i am still and shall be to my last breath one of them the red sea in the course of the day of the 29th of january the island of ceylon disappeared under the horizon and the nautilus at a speed of twenty miles an hour slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the maldives from the laccadives it coasted even the island of kiltan a land originally coraline discovered by vasco da gama in 1499 and one of the nineteen principal islands of the laccadive archipelago situated between 10 deg and 14 deg 30 n lat and 69 deg 50 72 e long we had made 16220 miles or 7500 french leagues from our startingpoint in the japanese seas the next day 30th january when the nautilus went to the surface of the ocean there was no land in sight its course was nne in the direction of the sea of oman between arabia and the indian peninsula which serves as an outlet to the persian gulf it was evidently a block without any possible egress where was captain nemo taking us to i could not say this however did not satisfy the canadian who that day came to me asking where we were going we are going where our captains fancy takes us master ned his fancy cannot take us far then said the canadian the persian gulf has no outlet and if we do go in it will not be long before we are out again very well then we will come out again master land and if after the persian gulf the nautilus would like to visit the red sea the straits of babelmandeb are there to give us entrance i need not tell you sir said ned land that the red sea is as much closed as the gulf as the isthmus of suez is not yet cut and if it was a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut with sluices and again the red sea is not the road to take us back to europe but i never said we were going back to europe what do you suppose then i suppose that after visiting the curious coasts of arabia and egypt the nautilus will go down the indian ocean again perhaps cross the channel of mozambique perhaps off the mascarenhas so as to gain the cape of good hope and once at the cape of good hope asked the canadian with peculiar emphasis well we shall penetrate into that atlantic which we do not yet know ah friend ned you are getting tired of this journey under the sea you are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine wonders for my part i shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage which it is given to so few men to make for four days till the 3rd of february the nautilus scoured the sea of oman at various speeds and at various depths it seemed to go at random as if hesitating as to which road it should follow but we never passed the tropic of cancer in quitting this sea we sighted muscat for an instant one of the most important towns of the country of oman i admired its strange aspect surrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood in relief i saw the rounded domes of its mosques the elegant points of its minarets its fresh and verdant terraces but it was only a vision the nautilus soon sank under the waves of that part of the sea we passed along the arabian coast of mahrah and hadramaut for a distance of six miles its undulating line of mountains being occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin the 5th of february we at last entered the gulf of aden a perfect funnel introduced into the neck of babelmandeb through which the indian waters entered the red sea the 6th of february the nautilus floated in sight of aden perched upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland a kind of inaccessible gibraltar the fortifications of which were rebuilt by the english after taking possession in 1839 i caught a glimpse of the octagon minarets of this town which was at one time the richest commercial magazine on the coast i certainly thought that captain nemo arrived at this point would back out again but i was mistaken for he did no such thing much to my surprise the next day the 7th of february we entered the straits of babelmandeb the name of which in the arab tongue means the gate of tears to twenty miles in breadth it is only thirtytwo in length and for the nautilus starting at full speed the crossing was scarcely the work of an hour but i saw nothing not even the island of perim with which the british government has fortified the position of aden there were too many english or french steamers of the line of suez to bombay calcutta to melbourne and from bourbon to the mauritius furrowing this narrow passage for the nautilus to venture to show itself so it remained prudently below at last about noon we were in the waters of the red sea i would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided captain nemo upon entering the gulf but i quite approved of the nautilus entering it its speed was lessened sometimes it kept on the surface sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel and thus i was able to observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea the 8th of february from the first dawn of day mocha came in sight now a ruined town whose walls would fall at a gunshot yet which shelters here and there some verdant datetrees once an important city containing six public markets and twentysix mosques and whose walls defended by fourteen forts formed a girdle of two miles in circumference the nautilus then approached the african shore where the depth of the sea was greater there between two waters clear as crystal through the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a splendid fur of green variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and algae and fuci what an indescribable spectacle and what variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic islands which bound the libyan coast but where these shrubs appeared in all their beauty was on the eastern coast which the nautilus soon gained it was on the coast of tehama for there not only did this display of zoophytes flourish beneath the level of the sea but they also formed picturesque interlacings which unfolded themselves about sixty feet above the surface more capricious but less highly coloured than those whose freshness was kept up by the vital power of the waters what charming hours i passed thus at the window of the saloon what new specimens of submarine flora and fauna did i admire under the brightness of our electric lantern the 9th of february the nautilus floated in the broadest part of the red sea which is comprised between souakin on the west coast and komfidah on the east coast with a diameter of ninety miles that day at noon after the bearings were taken captain nemo mounted the platform where i happened to be and i was determined not to let him go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior projects as soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me a cigar well sir does this red sea please you have you sufficiently observed the wonders it covers its fishes its zoophytes its parterres of sponges and its forests of coral did you catch a glimpse of the towns on its borders yes captain nemo i replied and the nautilus is wonderfully fitted for such a study ah it is an intelligent boat yes sir intelligent and invulnerable it fears neither the terrible tempests of the red sea nor its currents nor its sandbanks certainly said i this sea is quoted as one of the worst and in the time of the ancients if i am not mistaken its reputation was detestable detestable m aronnax the greek and latin historians do not speak favourably of it and strabo says it is very dangerous during the etesian winds and in the rainy season the arabian edrisi portrays it under the name of the gulf of colzoum and relates that vessels perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would risk sailing in the night it is he pretends a sea subject to fearful hurricanes strewn with inhospitable islands and which offers nothing good either on its surface or in its depths one may see i replied that these historians never sailed on board the nautilus just so replied the captain smiling and in that respect moderns are not more advanced than the ancients it required many ages to find out the mechanical power of steam who knows if in another hundred years we may not see a second nautilus progress is slow m aronnax it is true i answered your boat is at least a century before its time perhaps an era what a misfortune that the secret of such an invention should die with its inventor captain nemo did not reply after some minutes silence he continued you were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the dangerous navigation of the red sea it is true said i but were not their fears exaggerated yes and no m aronnax replied captain nemo who seemed to know the red sea by heart that which is no longer dangerous for a modern vessel well rigged strongly built and master of its own course thanks to obedient steam offered all sorts of perils to the ships of the ancients picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree saturated with the grease of the seadog and covered with powdered resin they had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings and they went by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything under such conditions shipwrecks were and must have been numerous but in our time steamers running between suez and the south seas have nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf in spite of contrary tradewinds the captain and passengers do not prepare for their departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices and on their return they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the gods in the neighbouring temple i agree with you said i and steam seems to have killed all gratitude in the hearts of sailors but captain since you seem to have especially studied this sea can you tell me the origin of its name there exist several explanations on the subject m aronnax would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century willingly this fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the passage of the israelites when pharaoh perished in the waves which closed at the voice of moses a poets explanation captain nemo i replied but i cannot content myself with that i ask you for your personal opinion here it is m aronnax according to my idea we must see in this appellation of the red sea a translation of the hebrew word edom and if the ancients gave it that name it was on account of the particular colour of its waters but up to this time i have seen nothing but transparent waves and without any particular colour very likely but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf you will see this singular appearance i remember seeing the bay of tor entirely red like a sea of blood and you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic seaweed yes so captain nemo it is not the first time you have overrun the red sea on board the nautilus no sir as you spoke a while ago of the passage of the israelites and of the catastrophe to the egyptians i will ask whether you have met with the traces under the water of this great historical fact no sir and for a good reason what is it it is that the spot where moses and his people passed is now so blocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there you can well understand that there would not be water enough for my nautilus and the spot i asked the spot is situated a little above the isthmus of suez in the arm which formerly made a deep estuary when the red sea extended to the salt lakes now whether this passage were miraculous or not the israelites nevertheless crossed there to reach the promised land and pharaohs army perished precisely on that spot and i think that excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large number of arms and instruments of egyptian origin that is evident i replied and for the sake of archaeologists let us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later when new towns are established on the isthmus after the construction of the suez canal a canal however very useless to a vessel like the nautilus very likely but useful to the whole world said captain nemo the ancients well understood the utility of a communication between the red sea and the mediterranean for their commercial affairs but they did not think of digging a canal direct and took the nile as an intermediate very probably the canal which united the nile to the red sea was begun by sesostris if we may believe tradition one thing is certain that in the year 615 before jesus christ necos undertook the works of an alimentary canal to the waters of the nile across the plain of egypt looking towards arabia it took four days to go up this canal and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast it was carried on by darius the son of hystaspes and probably finished by ptolemy ii strabo saw it navigated but its decline from the point of departure near bubastes to the red sea was so slight that it was only navigable for a few months in the year this canal answered all commercial purposes to the age of antonius when it was abandoned and blocked up with sand restored by order of the caliph omar it was definitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by caliph almansor who wished to prevent the arrival of provisions to mohammedbenabdallah who had revolted against him during the expedition into egypt your general bonaparte discovered traces of the works in the desert of suez and surprised by the tide he nearly perished before regaining hadjaroth at the very place where moses had encamped three thousand years before him well captain what the ancients dared not undertake this junction between the two seas which will shorten the road from cadiz to india m lesseps has succeeded in doing and before long he will have changed africa into an immense island yes m aronnax you have the right to be proud of your countryman such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains he began like so many others with disgust and rebuffs but he has triumphed for he has the genius of will and it is sad to think that a work like that which ought to have been an international work and which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious should have succeeded by the energy of one man all honour to m lesseps yes honour to the great citizen i replied surprised by the manner in which captain nemo had just spoken unfortunately he continued i cannot take you through the suez canal but you will be able to see the long jetty of port said after tomorrow when we shall be in the mediterranean the mediterranean i exclaimed yes sir does that astonish you what astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after tomorrow indeed yes captain although by this time i ought to have accustomed myself to be surprised at nothing since i have been on board your boat but the cause of this surprise well it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the nautilus if the day after tomorrow she is to be in the mediterranean having made the round of africa and doubled the cape of good hope who told you that she would make the round of africa and double the cape of good hope sir well unless the nautilus sails on dry land and passes above the isthmus or beneath it m aronnax beneath it certainly replied captain nemo quietly a long time ago nature made under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its surface what such a passage exists yes a subterranean passage which i have named the arabian tunnel it takes us beneath suez and opens into the gulf of pelusium but this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands to a certain depth but at fiftyfive yards only there is a solid layer of rock did you discover this passage by chance i asked more and more surprised chance and reasoning sir and by reasoning even more than by chance not only does this passage exist but i have profited by it several times without that i should not have ventured this day into the impassable red sea i noticed that in the red sea and in the mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind perfectly identical certain of the fact i asked myself was it possible that there was no communication between the two seas if there was the subterranean current must necessarily run from the red sea to the mediterranean from the sole cause of difference of level i caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of suez i passed a copper ring through their tails and threw them back into the sea some months later on the coast of syria i caught some of my fish ornamented with the ring thus the communication between the two was proved i then sought for it with my nautilus i discovered it ventured into it and before long sir you too will have passed through my arabian tunnel the arabian tunnel that same evening in 21 deg 30 n lat the nautilus floated on the surface of the sea approaching the arabian coast i saw djeddah the most important countinghouse of egypt syria turkey and india i distinguished clearly enough its buildings the vessels anchored at the quays and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the roads the sun rather low on the horizon struck full on the houses of the town bringing out their whiteness outside some wooden cabins and some made of reeds showed the quarter inhabited by the bedouins soon djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night and the nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent the next day the 10th of february we sighted several ships running to windward the nautilus returned to its submarine navigation but at noon when her bearings were taken the sea being deserted she rose again to her waterline accompanied by ned and conseil i seated myself on the platform the coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a damp fog we were leaning on the sides of the pinnace talking of one thing and another when ned land stretching out his hand towards a spot on the sea said do you see anything there sir no ned i replied but i have not your eyes you know look well said ned there on the starboard beam about the height of the lantern do you not see a mass which seems to move certainly said i after close attention i see something like a long black body on the top of the water and certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile from us it looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea it was a gigantic dugong ned land looked eagerly his eyes shone with covetousness at the sight of the animal his hand seemed ready to harpoon it one would have thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and attack it in its element at this instant captain nemo appeared on the platform he saw the dugong understood the canadians attitude and addressing him said if you held a harpoon just now master land would it not burn your hand just so sir and you would not be sorry to go back for one day to your trade of a fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have already killed i should not sir well you can try thank you sir said ned land his eyes flaming only continued the captain i advise you for your own sake not to miss the creature is the dugong dangerous to attack i asked in spite of the canadians shrug of the shoulders yes replied the captain sometimes the animal turns upon its assailants and overturns their boat but for master land this danger is not to be feared his eye is prompt his arm sure at this moment seven men of the crew mute and immovable as ever mounted the platform one carried a harpoon and a line similar to those employed in catching whales the pinnace was lifted from the bridge pulled from its socket and let down into the sea six oarsmen took their seats and the coxswain went to the tiller ned conseil and i went to the back of the boat you are not coming captain i asked no sir but i wish you good sport the boat put off and lifted by the six rowers drew rapidly towards the dugong which floated about two miles from the nautilus arrived some cableslength from the cetacean the speed slackened and the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters ned land harpoon in hand stood in the fore part of the boat the harpoon used for striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him but here the cord was not more than ten fathoms long and the extremity was attached to a small barrel which by floating was to show the course the dugong took under the water i stood and carefully watched the canadians adversary this dugong which also bears the name of the halicore closely resembles the manatee its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail and its lateral fins in perfect fingers its difference from the manatee consisted in its upper jaw which was armed with two long and pointed teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks this dugong which ned land was preparing to attack was of colossal dimensions it was more than seven yards long it did not move and seemed to be sleeping on the waves which circumstance made it easier to capture the boat approached within six yards of the animal the oars rested on the rowlocks i half rose ned land his body thrown a little back brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand suddenly a hissing noise was heard and the dugong disappeared the harpoon although thrown with great force had apparently only struck the water curse it exclaimed the canadian furiously i have missed it no said i the creature is woundedlook at the blood but your weapon has not stuck in his body my harpoon my harpoon cried ned land the sailors rowed on and the coxswain made for the floating barrel the harpoon regained we followed in pursuit of the animal the latter came now and then to the surface to breathe its wound had not weakened it for it shot onwards with great rapidity the boat rowed by strong arms flew on its track several times it approached within some few yards and the canadian was ready to strike but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge and it was impossible to reach it imagine the passion which excited impatient ned land he hurled at the unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the english tongue for my part i was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our attacks we pursued it without relaxation for an hour and i began to think it would prove difficult to capture when the animal possessed with the perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent turned upon the pinnace and assailed us in its turn this manoeuvre did not escape the canadian look out he cried the coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue doubtless warning the men to keep on their guard the dugong came within twenty feet of the boat stopped sniffed the air briskly with its large nostrils not pierced at the extremity but in the upper part of its muzzle then taking a spring he threw himself upon us the pinnace could not avoid the shock and half upset shipped at least two tons of water which had to be emptied but thanks to the coxswain we caught it sideways not full front so we were not quite overturned while ned land clinging to the bows belaboured the gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon the creatures teeth were buried in the gunwale and it lifted the whole thing out of the water as a lion does a roebuck we were upset over one another and i know not how the adventure would have ended if the canadian still enraged with the beast had not struck it to the heart i heard its teeth grind on the iron plate and the dugong disappeared carrying the harpoon with him but the barrel soon returned to the surface and shortly after the body of the animal turned on its back the boat came up with it took it in tow and made straight for the nautilus it required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the platform it weighed 10000 lb the next day 11th february the larder of the nautilus was enriched by some more delicate game a flight of seaswallows rested on the nautilus it was a species of the sterna nilotica peculiar to egypt its beak is black head grey and pointed the eye surrounded by white spots the back wings and tail of a greyish colour the belly and throat white and claws red they also took some dozen of nile ducks a wild bird of high flavour its throat and upper part of the head white with black spots about five oclock in the evening we sighted to the north the cape of rasmohammed this cape forms the extremity of arabia petraea comprised between the gulf of suez and the gulf of acabah the nautilus penetrated into the straits of jubal which leads to the gulf of suez i distinctly saw a high mountain towering between the two gulfs of rasmohammed it was mount horeb that sinai at the top of which moses saw god face to face at six oclock the nautilus sometimes floating sometimes immersed passed some distance from tor situated at the end of the bay the waters of which seemed tinted with red an observation already made by captain nemo then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other nightbirds and the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore chafing against the rocks or the panting of some faroff steamer beating the waters of the gulf with its noisy paddles from eight to nine oclock the nautilus remained some fathoms under the water according to my calculation we must have been very near suez through the panel of the saloon i saw the bottom of the rocks brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp we seemed to be leaving the straits behind us more and more at a quarterpast nine the vessel having returned to the surface i mounted the platform most impatient to pass through captain nemos tunnel i could not stay in one place so came to breathe the fresh night air soon in the shadow i saw a pale light half discoloured by the fog shining about a mile from us a floating lighthouse said someone near me i turned and saw the captain it is the floating light of suez he continued it will not be long before we gain the entrance of the tunnel the entrance cannot be easy no sir for that reason i am accustomed to go into the steersmans cage and myself direct our course and now if you will go down m aronnax the nautilus is going under the waves and will not return to the surface until we have passed through the arabian tunnel captain nemo led me towards the central staircase half way down he opened a door traversed the upper deck and landed in the pilots cage which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform it was a cabin measuring six feet square very much like that occupied by the pilot on the steamboats of the mississippi or hudson in the midst worked a wheel placed vertically and caught to the tillerrope which ran to the back of the nautilus four lightports with lenticular glasses let in a groove in the partition of the cabin allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions this cabin was dark but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the obscurity and i perceived the pilot a strong man with his hands resting on the spokes of the wheel outside the sea appeared vividly lit up by the lantern which shed its rays from the back of the cabin to the other extremity of the platform now said captain nemo let us try to make our passage electric wires connected the pilots cage with the machinery room and from there the captain could communicate simultaneously to his nautilus the direction and the speed he pressed a metal knob and at once the speed of the screw diminished i looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at this moment the immovable base of a massive sandy coast we followed it thus for an hour only some few yards off captain nemo did not take his eye from the knob suspended by its two concentric circles in the cabin at a simple gesture the pilot modified the course of the nautilus every instant i had placed myself at the portscuttle and saw some magnificent substructures of coral zoophytes seaweed and fucus agitating their enormous claws which stretched out from the fissures of the rock at a quarterpast ten the captain himself took the helm a large gallery black and deep opened before us the nautilus went boldly into it a strange roaring was heard round its sides it was the waters of the red sea which the incline of the tunnel precipitated violently towards the mediterranean the nautilus went with the torrent rapid as an arrow in spite of the efforts of the machinery which in order to offer more effective resistance beat the waves with reversed screw on the walls of the narrow passage i could see nothing but brilliant rays straight lines furrows of fire traced by the great speed under the brilliant electric light my heart beat fast at thirtyfive minutes past ten captain nemo quitted the helm and turning to me said the mediterranean in less than twenty minutes the nautilus carried along by the torrent had passed through the isthmus of suez the grecian archipelago the next day the 12th of february at the dawn of day the nautilus rose to the surface i hastened on to the platform three miles to the south the dim outline of pelusium was to be seen a torrent had carried us from one sea to another about seven oclock ned and conseil joined me well sir naturalist said the canadian in a slightly jovial tone and the mediterranean we are floating on its surface friend ned what said conseil this very night yes this very night in a few minutes we have passed this impassable isthmus i do not believe it replied the canadian then you are wrong master land i continued this low coast which rounds off to the south is the egyptian coast and you who have such good eyes ned you can see the jetty of port said stretching into the sea the canadian looked attentively certainly you are right sir and your captain is a firstrate man we are in the mediterranean good now if you please let us talk of our own little affair but so that no one hears us i saw what the canadian wanted and in any case i thought it better to let him talk as he wished it so we all three went and sat down near the lantern where we were less exposed to the spray of the blades now ned we listen what have you to tell us what i have to tell you is very simple we are in europe and before captain nemos caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the polar seas or lead us into oceania i ask to leave the nautilus i wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions but i certainly felt no desire to leave captain nemo thanks to him and thanks to his apparatus i was each day nearer the completion of my submarine studies and i was rewriting my book of submarine depths in its very element should i ever again have such an opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean no certainly not and i could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the nautilus before the cycle of investigation was accomplished friend ned answer me frankly are you tired of being on board are you sorry that destiny has thrown us into captain nemos hands the canadian remained some moments without answering then crossing his arms he said frankly i do not regret this journey under the seas i shall be glad to have made it but now that it is made let us have done with it that is my idea it will come to an end ned where and when where i do not knowwhen i cannot say or rather i suppose it will end when these seas have nothing more to teach us then what do you hope for demanded the canadian that circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which we may and ought to profit oh said ned land and where shall we be in six months if you please sir naturalist perhaps in china you know the nautilus is a rapid traveller it goes through water as swallows through the air or as an express on the land it does not fear frequented seas who can say that it may not beat the coasts of france england or america on which flight may be attempted as advantageously as here m aronnax replied the canadian your arguments are rotten at the foundation you speak in the future we shall be there we shall be here i speak in the present we are here and we must profit by it ned lands logic pressed me hard and i felt myself beaten on that ground i knew not what argument would now tell in my favour sir continued ned let us suppose an impossibility if captain nemo should this day offer you your liberty would you accept it i do not know i answered and if he added the offer made you this day was never to be renewed would you accept it friend ned this is my answer your reasoning is against me we must not rely on captain nemos goodwill common prudence forbids him to set us at liberty on the other side prudence bids us profit by the first opportunity to leave the nautilus well m aronnax that is wisely said only one observationjust one the occasion must be serious and our first attempt must succeed if it fails we shall never find another and captain nemo will never forgive us all that is true replied the canadian but your observation applies equally to all attempts at flight whether in two years time or in two days but the question is still this if a favourable opportunity presents itself it must be seized agreed and now ned will you tell me what you mean by a favourable opportunity it will be that which on a dark night will bring the nautilus a short distance from some european coast and you will try and save yourself by swimming yes if we were near enough to the bank and if the vessel was floating at the time not if the bank was far away and the boat was under the water and in that case in that case i should seek to make myself master of the pinnace i know how it is worked we must get inside and the bolts once drawn we shall come to the surface of the water without even the pilot who is in the bows perceiving our flight well ned watch for the opportunity but do not forget that a hitch will ruin us i will not forget sir and now ned would you like to know what i think of your project certainly m aronnax well i thinki do not say i hopei think that this favourable opportunity will never present itself why not because captain nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given up all hope of regaining our liberty and he will be on his guard above all in the seas and in the sight of european coasts we shall see replied ned land shaking his head determinedly and now ned land i added let us stop here not another word on the subject the day that you are ready come and let us know and we will follow you i rely entirely upon you thus ended a conversation which at no very distant time led to such grave results i must say here that facts seemed to confirm my foresight to the canadians great despair did captain nemo distrust us in these frequented seas or did he only wish to hide himself from the numerous vessels of all nations which ploughed the mediterranean i could not tell but we were oftener between waters and far from the coast or if the nautilus did emerge nothing was to be seen but the pilots cage and sometimes it went to great depths for between the grecian archipelago and asia minor we could not touch the bottom by more than a thousand fathoms thus i only knew we were near the island of carpathos one of the sporades by captain nemo reciting these lines from virgil est carpathio neptuni gurgite vates caeruleus proteus as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere it was indeed the ancient abode of proteus the old shepherd of neptunes flocks now the island of scarpanto situated between rhodes and crete i saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels of the saloon the next day the 14th of february i resolved to employ some hours in studying the fishes of the archipelago but for some reason or other the panels remained hermetically sealed upon taking the course of the nautilus i found that we were going towards candia the ancient isle of crete at the time i embarked on the abraham lincoln the whole of this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the turks but how the insurgents had fared since that time i was absolutely ignorant and it was not captain nemo deprived of all land communications who could tell me i made no allusion to this event when that night i found myself alone with him in the saloon besides he seemed to be taciturn and preoccupied then contrary to his custom he ordered both panels to be opened and going from one to the other observed the mass of waters attentively to what end i could not guess so on my side i employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes in the midst of the waters a man appeared a diver carrying at his belt a leathern purse it was not a body abandoned to the waves it was a living man swimming with a strong hand disappearing occasionally to take breath at the surface i turned towards captain nemo and in an agitated voice exclaimed a man shipwrecked he must be saved at any price the captain did not answer me but came and leaned against the panel the man had approached and with his face flattened against the glass was looking at us to my great amazement captain nemo signed to him the diver answered with his hand mounted immediately to the surface of the water and did not appear again do not be uncomfortable said captain nemo it is nicholas of cape matapan surnamed pesca he is well known in all the cyclades a bold diver water is his element and he lives more in it than on land going continually from one island to another even as far as crete you know him captain why not m aronnax saying which captain nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing near the left panel of the saloon near this piece of furniture i saw a chest bound with iron on the cover of which was a copper plate bearing the cypher of the nautilus with its device at that moment the captain without noticing my presence opened the piece of furniture a sort of strong box which held a great many ingots they were ingots of gold from whence came this precious metal which represented an enormous sum where did the captain gather this gold from and what was he going to do with it i did not say one word i looked captain nemo took the ingots one by one and arranged them methodically in the chest which he filled entirely i estimated the contents at more than 4000 lb weight of gold that is to say nearly l200000 the chest was securely fastened and the captain wrote an address on the lid in characters which must have belonged to modern greece this done captain nemo pressed a knob the wire of which communicated with the quarters of the crew four men appeared and not without some trouble pushed the chest out of the saloon then i heard them hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys at that moment captain nemo turned to me and you were saying sir said he i was saying nothing captain then sir if you will allow me i will wish you good night whereupon he turned and left the saloon i returned to my room much troubled as one may believe i vainly tried to sleepi sought the connecting link between the apparition of the diver and the chest filled with gold soon i felt by certain movements of pitching and tossing that the nautilus was leaving the depths and returning to the surface then i heard steps upon the platform and i knew they were unfastening the pinnace and launching it upon the waves for one instant it struck the side of the nautilus then all noise ceased two hours after the same noise the same going and coming was renewed the boat was hoisted on board replaced in its socket and the nautilus again plunged under the waves so these millions had been transported to their address to what point of the continent who was captain nemos correspondent the next day i related to conseil and the canadian the events of the night which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree my companions were not less surprised than myself but where does he take his millions to asked ned land to that there was no possible answer i returned to the saloon after having breakfast and set to work till five oclock in the evening i employed myself in arranging my notes at that momentought i to attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasyi felt so great a heat that i was obliged to take off my coat it was strange for we were under low latitudes and even then the nautilus submerged as it was ought to experience no change of temperature i looked at the manometer it showed a depth of sixty feet to which atmospheric heat could never attain i continued my work but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be intolerable could there be fire on board i asked myself i was leaving the saloon when captain nemo entered he approached the thermometer consulted it and turning to me said fortytwo degrees i have noticed it captain i replied and if it gets much hotter we cannot bear it oh sir it will not get better if we do not wish it you can reduce it as you please then no but i can go farther from the stove which produces it it is outward then certainly we are floating in a current of boiling water is it possible i exclaimed look the panels opened and i saw the sea entirely white all round a sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves which boiled like water in a copper i placed my hand on one of the panes of glass but the heat was so great that i quickly took it off again where are we i asked near the island of santorin sir replied the captain i wished to give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption i thought said i that the formation of these new islands was ended nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea replied captain nemo and the globe is always being worked by subterranean fires already in the nineteenth year of our era according to cassiodorus and pliny a new island theia the divine appeared in the very place where these islets have recently been formed then they sank under the waves to rise again in the year 69 when they again subsided since that time to our days the plutonian work has been suspended but on the 3rd of february 1866 a new island which they named george island emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour near nea kamenni and settled again the 6th of the same month seven days after the 13th of february the island of aphroessa appeared leaving between nea kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad i was in these seas when the phenomenon occurred and i was able therefore to observe all the different phases the island of aphroessa of round form measured 300 feet in diameter and 30 feet in height it was composed of black and vitreous lava mixed with fragments of felspar and lastly on the 10th of march a smaller island called reka showed itself near nea kamenni and since then these three have joined together forming but one and the same island and the canal in which we are at this moment i asked here it is replied captain nemo showing me a map of the archipelago you see i have marked the new islands i returned to the glass the nautilus was no longer moving the heat was becoming unbearable the sea which till now had been white was red owing to the presence of salts of iron in spite of the ships being hermetically sealed an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the saloon and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished by bright scarlet flames i was in a bath i was choking i was broiled we can remain no longer in this boiling water said i to the captain it would not be prudent replied the impassive captain nemo an order was given the nautilus tacked about and left the furnace it could not brave with impunity a quarter of an hour after we were breathing fresh air on the surface the thought then struck me that if ned land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight we should never have come alive out of this sea of fire the next day the 16th of february we left the basin which between rhodes and alexandria is reckoned about 1500 fathoms in depth and the nautilus passing some distance from cerigo quitted the grecian archipelago after having doubled cape matapan the mediterranean in fortyeight hours the mediterranean the blue sea par excellence the great sea of the hebrews the sea of the greeks the mare nostrum of the romans bordered by orangetrees aloes cacti and seapines embalmed with the perfume of the myrtle surrounded by rude mountains saturated with pure and transparent air but incessantly worked by underground fires a perfect battlefield in which neptune and pluto still dispute the empire of the world it is upon these banks and on these waters says michelet that man is renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe but beautiful as it was i could only take a rapid glance at the basin whose superficial area is two million of square yards even captain nemos knowledge was lost to me for this puzzling person did not appear once during our passage at full speed i estimated the course which the nautilus took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred leagues and it was accomplished in fortyeight hours starting on the morning of the 16th of february from the shores of greece we had crossed the straits of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th it was plain to me that this mediterranean enclosed in the midst of those countries which he wished to avoid was distasteful to captain nemo those waves and those breezes brought back too many remembrances if not too many regrets here he had no longer that independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open seas and his nautilus felt itself cramped between the close shores of africa and europe our speed was now twentyfive miles an hour it may be well understood that ned land to his great disgust was obliged to renounce his intended flight he could not launch the pinnace going at the rate of twelve or thirteen yards every second to quit the nautilus under such conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full speedan imprudent thing to say the least of it besides our vessel only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of air it was steered entirely by the compass and the log i saw no more of the interior of this mediterranean than a traveller by express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes that is to say the distant horizon and not the nearer objects which pass like a flash of lightning we were then passing between sicily and the coast of tunis in the narrow space between cape bon and the straits of messina the bottom of the sea rose almost suddenly there was a perfect bank on which there was not more than nine fathoms of water whilst on either side the depth was ninety fathoms the nautilus had to manoeuvre very carefully so as not to strike against this submarine barrier i showed conseil on the map of the mediterranean the spot occupied by this reef but if you please sir observed conseil it is like a real isthmus joining europe to africa yes my boy it forms a perfect bar to the straits of lybia and the soundings of smith have proved that in former times the continents between cape boco and cape furina were joined i can well believe it said conseil i will add i continued that a similar barrier exists between gibraltar and ceuta which in geological times formed the entire mediterranean what if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers above the waves it is not probable conseil well but allow me to finish please sir if this phenomenon should take place it will be troublesome for m lesseps who has taken so much pains to pierce the isthmus i agree with you but i repeat conseil this phenomenon will never happen the violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing volcanoes so plentiful in the first days of the world are being extinguished by degrees the internal heat is weakened the temperature of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity every century to the detriment of our globe for its heat is its life but the sun the sun is not sufficient conseil can it give heat to a dead body not that i know of well my friend this earth will one day be that cold corpse it will become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon which has long since lost all its vital heat in how many centuries in some hundreds of thousands of years my boy then said conseil we shall have time to finish our journeythat is if ned land does not interfere with it and conseil reassured returned to the study of the bank which the nautilus was skirting at a moderate speed during the night of the 16th and 17th february we had entered the second mediterranean basin the greatest depth of which was 1450 fathoms the nautilus by the action of its crew slid down the inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea on the 18th of february about three oclock in the morning we were at the entrance of the straits of gibraltar there once existed two currents an upper one long since recognised which conveys the waters of the ocean into the basin of the mediterranean and a lower countercurrent which reasoning has now shown to exist indeed the volume of water in the mediterranean incessantly added to by the waves of the atlantic and by rivers falling into it would each year raise the level of this sea for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore the equilibrium as it is not so we must necessarily admit the existence of an undercurrent which empties into the basin of the atlantic through the straits of gibraltar the surplus waters of the mediterranean a fact indeed and it was this countercurrent by which the nautilus profited it advanced rapidly by the narrow pass for one instant i caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of hercules buried in the ground according to pliny and with the low island which supports it and a few minutes later we were floating on the atlantic vigo bay the atlantic a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers twentyfive millions of square miles the length of which is nine thousand miles with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundredan ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference watered by the largest rivers of the world the st lawrence the mississippi the amazon the plata the orinoco the niger the senegal the elbe the loire and the rhine which carry water from the most civilised as well as from the most savage countries magnificent field of water incessantly ploughed by vessels of every nation sheltered by the flags of every nation and which terminates in those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners cape horn and the cape of tempests the nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half a distance greater than the great circle of the earth where were we going now and what was reserved for the future the nautilus leaving the straits of gibraltar had gone far out it returned to the surface of the waves and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us i mounted at once accompanied by ned land and conseil at a distance of about twelve miles cape st vincent was dimly to be seen forming the southwestern point of the spanish peninsula a strong southerly gale was blowing the sea was swollen and billowy it made the nautilus rock violently it was almost impossible to keep ones foot on the platform which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every instant so we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air i returned to my room conseil to his cabin but the canadian with a preoccupied air followed me our rapid passage across the mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution and he could not help showing his disappointment when the door of my room was shut he sat down and looked at me silently friend ned said i i understand you but you cannot reproach yourself to have attempted to leave the nautilus under the circumstances would have been folly ned land did not answer his compressed lips and frowning brow showed with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind let us see i continued we need not despair yet we are going up the coast of portugal again france and england are not far off where we can easily find refuge now if the nautilus on leaving the straits of gibraltar had gone to the south if it had carried us towards regions where there were no continents i should share your uneasiness but we know now that captain nemo does not fly from civilised seas and in some days i think you can act with security ned land still looked at me fixedly at length his fixed lips parted and he said it is for tonight i drew myself up suddenly i was i admit little prepared for this communication i wanted to answer the canadian but words would not come we agreed to wait for an opportunity continued ned land and the opportunity has arrived this night we shall be but a few miles from the spanish coast it is cloudy the wind blows freely i have your word m aronnax and i rely upon you as i was silent the canadian approached me tonight at nine oclock said he i have warned conseil at that moment captain nemo will be shut up in his room probably in bed neither the engineers nor the ships crew can see us conseil and i will gain the central staircase and you m aronnax will remain in the library two steps from us waiting my signal the oars the mast and the sail are in the canoe i have even succeeded in getting some provisions i have procured an english wrench to unfasten the bolts which attach it to the shell of the nautilus so all is ready till tonight the sea is bad that i allow replied the canadian but we must risk that liberty is worth paying for besides the boat is strong and a few miles with a fair wind to carry us is no great thing who knows but by tomorrow we may be a hundred leagues away let circumstances only favour us and by ten or eleven oclock we shall have landed on some spot of terra firma alive or dead but adieu now till tonight with these words the canadian withdrew leaving me almost dumb i had imagined that the chance gone i should have time to reflect and discuss the matter my obstinate companion had given me no time and after all what could i have said to him ned land was perfectly right there was almost the opportunity to profit by could i retract my word and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions tomorrow captain nemo might take us far from all land at that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs were filling and that the nautilus was sinking under the waves of the atlantic a sad day i passed between the desire of regaining my liberty of action and of abandoning the wonderful nautilus and leaving my submarine studies incomplete what dreadful hours i passed thus sometimes seeing myself and companions safely landed sometimes wishing in spite of my reason that some unforeseen circumstance would prevent the realisation of ned lands project twice i went to the saloon i wished to consult the compass i wished to see if the direction the nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer or taking us farther from the coast but no the nautilus kept in portuguese waters i must therefore take my part and prepare for flight my luggage was not heavy my notes nothing more as to captain nemo i asked myself what he would think of our escape what trouble what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in case of its discovery or failure certainly i had no cause to complain of him on the contrary never was hospitality freer than his in leaving him i could not be taxed with ingratitude no oath bound us to him it was on the strength of circumstances he relied and not upon our word to fix us for ever i had not seen the captain since our visit to the island of santorin would chance bring me to his presence before our departure i wished it and i feared it at the same time i listened if i could hear him walking the room contiguous to mine no sound reached my ear i felt an unbearable uneasiness this day of waiting seemed eternal hours struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience my dinner was served in my room as usual i ate but little i was too preoccupied i left the table at seven oclock a hundred and twenty minutes i counted them still separated me from the moment in which i was to join ned land my agitation redoubled my pulse beat violently i could not remain quiet i went and came hoping to calm my troubled spirit by constant movement the idea of failure in our bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties but the thought of seeing our project discovered before leaving the nautilus of being brought before captain nemo irritated or what was worse saddened at my desertion made my heart beat i wanted to see the saloon for the last time i descended the stairs and arrived in the museum where i had passed so many useful and agreeable hours i looked at all its riches all its treasures like a man on the eve of an eternal exile who was leaving never to return these wonders of nature these masterpieces of art amongst which for so many days my life had been concentrated i was going to abandon them for ever i should like to have taken a last look through the windows of the saloon into the waters of the atlantic but the panels were hermetically closed and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean which i had not yet explored in passing through the saloon i came near the door let into the angle which opened into the captains room to my great surprise this door was ajar i drew back involuntarily if captain nemo should be in his room he could see me but hearing no sound i drew nearer the room was deserted i pushed open the door and took some steps forward still the same monklike severity of aspect suddenly the clock struck eight the first beat of the hammer on the bell awoke me from my dreams i trembled as if an invisible eye had plunged into my most secret thoughts and i hurried from the room there my eye fell upon the compass our course was still north the log indicated moderate speed the manometer a depth of about sixty feet i returned to my room clothed myself warmlysea boots an otterskin cap a great coat of byssus lined with sealskin i was ready i was waiting the vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which reigned on board i listened attentively would no loud voice suddenly inform me that ned land had been surprised in his projected flight a mortal dread hung over me and i vainly tried to regain my accustomed coolness at a few minutes to nine i put my ear to the captains door no noise i left my room and returned to the saloon which was half in obscurity but deserted i opened the door communicating with the library the same insufficient light the same solitude i placed myself near the door leading to the central staircase and there waited for ned lands signal at that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished then it stopped entirely the silence was now only disturbed by the beatings of my own heart suddenly a slight shock was felt and i knew that the nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean my uneasiness increased the canadians signal did not come i felt inclined to join ned land and beg of him to put off his attempt i felt that we were not sailing under our usual conditions at this moment the door of the large saloon opened and captain nemo appeared he saw me and without further preamble began in an amiable tone of voice ah sir i have been looking for you do you know the history of spain now one might know the history of ones own country by heart but in the condition i was at the time with troubled mind and head quite lost i could not have said a word of it well continued captain nemo you heard my question do you know the history of spain very slightly i answered well here are learned men having to learn said the captain come sit down and i will tell you a curious episode in this history sir listen well said he this history will interest you on one side for it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to solve i listen captain said i not knowing what my interlocutor was driving at and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our projected flight sir if you have no objection we will go back to 1702 you cannot be ignorant that your king louis xiv thinking that the gesture of a potentate was sufficient to bring the pyrenees under his yoke had imposed the duke of anjou his grandson on the spaniards this prince reigned more or less badly under the name of philip v and had a strong party against him abroad indeed the preceding year the royal houses of holland austria and england had concluded a treaty of alliance at the hague with the intention of plucking the crown of spain from the head of philip v and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they prematurely gave the title of charles iii spain must resist this coalition but she was almost entirely unprovided with either soldiers or sailors however money would not fail them provided that their galleons laden with gold and silver from america once entered their ports and about the end of 1702 they expected a rich convoy which france was escorting with a fleet of twentythree vessels commanded by admiral chateaurenaud for the ships of the coalition were already beating the atlantic this convoy was to go to cadiz but the admiral hearing that an english fleet was cruising in those waters resolved to make for a french port the spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision they wanted to be taken to a spanish port and if not to cadiz into vigo bay situated on the northwest coast of spain and which was not blocked admiral chateaurenaud had the rashness to obey this injunction and the galleons entered vigo bay unfortunately it formed an open road which could not be defended in any way they must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the arrival of the combined fleet and time would not have failed them had not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen you are following the chain of events asked captain nemo perfectly said i not knowing the end proposed by this historical lesson i will continue this is what passed the merchants of cadiz had a privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise coming from the west indies now to disembark these ingots at the port of vigo was depriving them of their rights they complained at madrid and obtained the consent of the weakminded philip that the convoy without discharging its cargo should remain sequestered in the roads of vigo until the enemy had disappeared but whilst coming to this decision on the 22nd of october 1702 the english vessels arrived in vigo bay when admiral chateaurenaud in spite of inferior forces fought bravely but seeing that the treasure must fall into the enemys hands he burnt and scuttled every galleon which went to the bottom with their immense riches captain nemo stopped i admit i could not see yet why this history should interest me well i asked well m aronnax replied captain nemo we are in that vigo bay and it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries the captain rose telling me to follow him i had had time to recover i obeyed the saloon was dark but through the transparent glass the waves were sparkling i looked for half a mile around the nautilus the waters seemed bathed in electric light the sandy bottom was clean and bright some of the ships crew in their divingdresses were clearing away halfrotten barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks from these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver cascades of piastres and jewels the sand was heaped up with them laden with their precious booty the men returned to the nautilus disposed of their burden and went back to this inexhaustible fishery of gold and silver i understood now this was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of october 1702 here on this very spot the galleons laden for the spanish government had sunk here captain nemo came according to his wants to pack up those millions with which he burdened the nautilus it was for him and him alone america had given up her precious metals he was heir direct without anyone to share in those treasures torn from the incas and from the conquered of ferdinand cortez did you know sir he asked smiling that the sea contained such riches i knew i answered that they value money held in suspension in these waters at two millions doubtless but to extract this money the expense would be greater than the profit here on the contrary i have but to pick up what man has lostand not only in vigo bay but in a thousand other ports where shipwrecks have happened and which are marked on my submarine map can you understand now the source of the millions i am worth i understand captain but allow me to tell you that in exploring vigo bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society and which a society which has received from the spanish government the privilege of seeking those buried galleons the shareholders are led on by the allurement of an enormous bounty for they value these rich shipwrecks at five hundred millions five hundred millions they were answered captain nemo but they are so no longer just so said i and a warning to those shareholders would be an act of charity but who knows if it would be well received what gamblers usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their foolish hopes after all i pity them less than the thousands of unfortunates to whom so much riches welldistributed would have been profitable whilst for them they will be for ever barren i had no sooner expressed this regret than i felt that it must have wounded captain nemo barren he exclaimed with animation do you think then sir that these riches are lost because i gather them is it for myself alone according to your idea that i take the trouble to collect these treasures who told you that i did not make a good use of it do you think i am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races on this earth miserable creatures to console victims to avenge do you not understand captain nemo stopped at these last words regretting perhaps that he had spoken so much but i had guessed that whatever the motive which had forced him to seek independence under the sea it had left him still a man that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as individuals and i then understood for whom those millions were destined which were forwarded by captain nemo when the nautilus was cruising in the waters of crete a vanished continent the next morning the 19th of february i saw the canadian enter my room i expected this visit he looked very disappointed well sir said he well ned fortune was against us yesterday yes that captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended leaving his vessel yes ned he had business at his bankers his bankers or rather his bankinghouse by that i mean the ocean where his riches are safer than in the chests of the state i then related to the canadian the incidents of the preceding night hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the captain but my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret from ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of vigo on his own account however said he all is not ended it is only a blow of the harpoon lost another time we must succeed and tonight if necessary in what direction is the nautilus going i asked i do not know replied ned well at noon we shall see the point the canadian returned to conseil as soon as i was dressed i went into the saloon the compass was not reassuring the course of the nautilus was ssw we were turning our backs on europe i waited with some impatience till the ships place was pricked on the chart at about halfpast eleven the reservoirs were emptied and our vessel rose to the surface of the ocean i rushed towards the platform ned land had preceded me no more land in sight nothing but an immense sea some sails on the horizon doubtless those going to san roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the cape of good hope the weather was cloudy a gale of wind was preparing ned raved and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon he still hoped that behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for at noon the sun showed itself for an instant the second profited by this brightness to take its height then the sea becoming more billowy we descended and the panel closed an hour after upon consulting the chart i saw the position of the nautilus was marked at 16 deg 17 long and 33 deg 22 lat at 150 leagues from the nearest coast there was no means of flight and i leave you to imagine the rage of the canadian when i informed him of our situation for myself i was not particularly sorry i felt lightened of the load which had oppressed me and was able to return with some degree of calmness to my accustomed work that night about eleven oclock i received a most unexpected visit from captain nemo he asked me very graciously if i felt fatigued from my watch of the preceding night i answered in the negative then m aronnax i propose a curious excursion propose captain you have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight under the brightness of the sun would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night most willingly i warn you the way will be tiring we shall have far to walk and must climb a mountain the roads are not well kept what you say captain only heightens my curiosity i am ready to follow you come then sir we will put on our divingdresses arrived at the robingroom i saw that neither of my companions nor any of the ships crew were to follow us on this excursion captain nemo had not even proposed my taking with me either ned or conseil in a few moments we had put on our divingdresses they placed on our backs the reservoirs abundantly filled with air but no electric lamps were prepared i called the captains attention to the fact they will be useless he replied i thought i had not heard aright but i could not repeat my observation for the captains head had already disappeared in its metal case i finished harnessing myself i felt them put an ironpointed stick into my hand and some minutes later after going through the usual form we set foot on the bottom of the atlantic at a depth of 150 fathoms midnight was near the waters were profoundly dark but captain nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot a sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the nautilus what this fire might be what could feed it why and how it lit up the liquid mass i could not say in any case it did light our way vaguely it is true but i soon accustomed myself to the peculiar darkness and i understood under such circumstances the uselessness of the ruhmkorff apparatus as we advanced i heard a kind of pattering above my head the noise redoubling sometimes producing a continual shower i soon understood the cause it was rain falling violently and crisping the surface of the waves instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that i should be wet through by the water in the midst of the water i could not help laughing at the odd idea but indeed in the thick divingdress the liquid element is no longer felt and one only seems to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere nothing more after half an hours walk the soil became stony medusae microscopic crustacea and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent gleam i caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of zoophytes and masses of sea weed my feet often slipped upon this sticky carpet of sea weed and without my irontipped stick i should have fallen more than once in turning round i could still see the whitish lantern of the nautilus beginning to pale in the distance but the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon the presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree was i going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_ of the earth or even for this thought crossed my brain had the hand of man aught to do with this conflagration had he fanned this flame was i to meet in these depths companions and friends of captain nemo whom he was going to visit and who like him led this strange existence should i find down there a whole colony of exiles who weary of the miseries of this earth had sought and found independence in the deep ocean all these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued me and in this condition of mind overexcited by the succession of wonders continually passing before my eyes i should not have been surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which captain nemo dreamed our road grew lighter and lighter the white glimmer came in rays from the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high but what i saw was simply a reflection developed by the clearness of the waters the source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of the mountain in the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the atlantic captain nemo advanced without hesitation he knew this dreary road doubtless he had often travelled over it and could not lose himself i followed him with unshaken confidence he seemed to me like a genie of the sea and as he walked before me i could not help admiring his stature which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon it was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the mountain but to gain access to them we must venture through the difficult paths of a vast copse yes a copse of dead trees without leaves without sap trees petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by gigantic pines it was like a coalpit still standing holding by the roots to the broken soil and whose branches like fine black paper cuttings showed distinctly on the watery ceiling picture to yourself a forest in the hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain but a forest swallowed up the paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea i went along climbing the rocks striding over extended trunks breaking the sea bindweed which hung from one tree to the other and frightening the fishes which flew from branch to branch pressing onward i felt no fatigue i followed my guide who was never tired what a spectacle how can i express it how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in this mediumtheir under parts dark and wild the upper coloured with red tints by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters doubled we climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic bounds and the low growling of an avalanche to right and left ran long dark galleries where sight was lost here opened vast glades which the hand of man seemed to have worked and i sometimes asked myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly appear to me but captain nemo was still mounting i could not stay behind i followed boldly my stick gave me good help a false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs but i walked with firm step without feeling any giddiness now i jumped a crevice the depth of which would have made me hesitate had it been among the glaciers on the land now i ventured on the unsteady trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other without looking under my feet having only eyes to admire the wild sites of this region there monumental rocks leaning on their regularlycut bases seemed to defy all laws of equilibrium from between their stony knees trees sprang like a jet under heavy pressure and upheld others which upheld them natural towers large scarps cut perpendicularly like a curtain inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could never have tolerated in terrestrial regions two hours after quitting the nautilus we had crossed the line of trees and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain which cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope some petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there fishes got up under our feet like birds in the long grass the massive rocks were rent with impenetrable fractures deep grottos and unfathomable holes at the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving my blood curdled when i saw enormous antennae blocking my road or some frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness they were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes giant lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers and moving their claws with the clicking sound of pincers titanic crabs pointed like a gun on its carriage and frightfullooking poulps interweaving their tentacles like a living nest of serpents we had now arrived on the first platform where other surprises awaited me before us lay some picturesque ruins which betrayed the hand of man and not that of the creator there were vast heaps of stone amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles and temples clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes and over which instead of ivy seaweed and fucus threw a thick vegetable mantle but what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of prehistoric times where was i whither had captain nemos fancy hurried me i would fain have asked him not being able to i stopped himi seized his arm but shaking his head and pointing to the highest point of the mountain he seemed to say come come along come higher i followed and in a few minutes i had climbed to the top which for a circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock i looked down the side we had just climbed the mountain did not rise more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain but on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of this part of the atlantic my eyes ranged far over a large space lit by a violent fulguration in fact the mountain was a volcano at fifty feet above the peak in the midst of a rain of stones and scoriae a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass thus situated this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch even to the extreme limits of the horizon i said that the submarine crater threw up lava but no flames flames require the oxygen of the air to feed upon and cannot be developed under water but streams of lava having in themselves the principles of their incandescence can attain a white heat fight vigorously against the liquid element and turn it to vapour by contact rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of vesuvius on another terra del greco there indeed under my eyes ruined destroyed lay a townits roofs open to the sky its temples fallen its arches dislocated its columns lying on the ground from which one would still recognise the massive character of tuscan architecture further on some remains of a gigantic aqueduct here the high base of an acropolis with the floating outline of a parthenon there traces of a quay as if an ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean and disappeared with its merchant vessels and its wargalleys farther on again long lines of sunken walls and broad deserted streetsa perfect pompeii escaped beneath the waters such was the sight that captain nemo brought before my eyes where was i where was i i must know at any cost i tried to speak but captain nemo stopped me by a gesture and picking up a piece of chalkstone advanced to a rock of black basalt and traced the one word atlantis what a light shot through my mind atlantis the atlantis of plato that continent denied by origen and humbolt who placed its disappearance amongst the legendary tales i had it there now before my eyes bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its catastrophe the region thus engulfed was beyond europe asia and lybia beyond the columns of hercules where those powerful people the atlantides lived against whom the first wars of ancient greeks were waged thus led by the strangest destiny i was treading under foot the mountains of this continent touching with my hand those ruins a thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs i was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first man had walked whilst i was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand landscape captain nemo remained motionless as if petrified in mute ecstasy leaning on a mossy stone was he dreaming of those generations long since disappeared was he asking them the secret of human destiny was it here this strange man came to steep himself in historical recollections and live again this ancient lifehe who wanted no modern one what would i not have given to know his thoughts to share them to understand them we remained for an hour at this place contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of the lava which was some times wonderfully intense rapid tremblings ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings deep noise distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic grandeur at this moment the moon appeared through the mass of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent it was but a gleam but what an indescribable effect the captain rose cast one last look on the immense plain and then bade me follow him we descended the mountain rapidly and the mineral forest once passed i saw the lantern of the nautilus shining like a star the captain walked straight to it and we got on board as the first rays of light whitened the surface of the ocean the submarine coalmines the next day the 20th of february i awoke very late the fatigues of the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven oclock i dressed quickly and hastened to find the course the nautilus was taking the instruments showed it to be still toward the south with a speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms the species of fishes here did not differ much from those already noticed there were rays of giant size five yards long and endowed with great muscular strength which enabled them to shoot above the waves sharks of many kinds amongst others one fifteen feet long with triangular sharp teeth and whose transparency rendered it almost invisible in the water amongst bony fish conseil noticed some about three yards long armed at the upper jaw with a piercing sword other brightcoloured creatures known in the time of aristotle by the name of the seadragon which are dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back about four oclock the soil generally composed of a thick mud mixed with petrified wood changed by degrees and it became more stony and seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt with a sprinkling of lava i thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long plains and accordingly after a few evolutions of the nautilus i saw the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all exit its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean it must be a continent or at least an islandone of the canaries or of the cape verde islands the bearings not being yet taken perhaps designedly i was ignorant of our exact position in any case such a wall seemed to me to mark the limits of that atlantis of which we had in reality passed over only the smallest part much longer should i have remained at the window admiring the beauties of sea and sky but the panels closed at this moment the nautilus arrived at the side of this high perpendicular wall what it would do i could not guess i returned to my room it no longer moved i laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours sleep but it was eight oclock the next day when i entered the saloon i looked at the manometer it told me that the nautilus was floating on the surface of the ocean besides i heard steps on the platform i went to the panel it was open but instead of broad daylight as i expected i was surrounded by profound darkness where were we was i mistaken was it still night no not a star was shining and night has not that utter darkness i knew not what to think when a voice near me said is that you professor ah captain i answered where are we underground sir underground i exclaimed and the nautilus floating still it always floats but i do not understand wait a few minutes our lantern will be lit and if you like light places you will be satisfied i stood on the platform and waited the darkness was so complete that i could not even see captain nemo but looking to the zenith exactly above my head i seemed to catch an undecided gleam a kind of twilight filling a circular hole at this instant the lantern was lit and its vividness dispelled the faint light i closed my dazzled eyes for an instant and then looked again the nautilus was stationary floating near a mountain which formed a sort of quay the lake then supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls measuring two miles in diameter and six in circumference its level the manometer showed could only be the same as the outside level for there must necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea the high partitions leaning forward on their base grew into a vaulted roof bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down the height being about five or six hundred yards at the summit was a circular orifice by which i had caught the slight gleam of light evidently daylight where are we i asked in the very heart of an extinct volcano the interior of which has been invaded by the sea after some great convulsion of the earth whilst you were sleeping professor the nautilus penetrated to this lagoon by a natural canal which opens about ten yards beneath the surface of the ocean this is its harbour of refuge a sure commodious and mysterious one sheltered from all gales show me if you can on the coasts of any of your continents or islands a road which can give such perfect refuge from all storms certainly i replied you are in safety here captain nemo who could reach you in the heart of a volcano but did i not see an opening at its summit yes its crater formerly filled with lava vapour and flames and which now gives entrance to the lifegiving air we breathe but what is this volcanic mountain it belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is strewnto vessels a simple sandbankto us an immense cavern chance led me to discover it and chance served me well but of what use is this refuge captain the nautilus wants no port no sir but it wants electricity to make it move and the wherewithal to make the electricitysodium to feed the elements coal from which to get the sodium and a coalmine to supply the coal and exactly on this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological periods now mineralised and transformed into coal for me they are an inexhaustible mine your men follow the trade of miners here then captain exactly so these mines extend under the waves like the mines of newcastle here in their divingdresses pick axe and shovel in hand my men extract the coal which i do not even ask from the mines of the earth when i burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium the smoke escaping from the crater of the mountain gives it the appearance of a stillactive volcano and we shall see your companions at work no not this time at least for i am in a hurry to continue our submarine tour of the earth so i shall content myself with drawing from the reserve of sodium i already possess the time for loading is one day only and we continue our voyage so if you wish to go over the cavern and make the round of the lagoon you must take advantage of today m aronnax i thanked the captain and went to look for my companions who had not yet left their cabin i invited them to follow me without saying where we were they mounted the platform conseil who was astonished at nothing seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake under a mountain after having fallen asleep under the waves but ned land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit after breakfast about ten oclock we went down on to the mountain here we are once more on land said conseil i do not call this land said the canadian and besides we are not on it but beneath it between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a sandy shore which at its greatest breadth measured five hundred feet on this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake but the base of the high partitions was stony ground with volcanic locks and enormous pumicestones lying in picturesque heaps all these detached masses covered with enamel polished by the action of the subterraneous fires shone resplendent by the light of our electric lantern the mica dust from the shore rising under our feet flew like a cloud of sparks the bottom now rose sensibly and we soon arrived at long circuitous slopes or inclined planes which took us higher by degrees but we were obliged to walk carefully among these conglomerates bound by no cement the feet slipping on the glassy crystal felspar and quartz the volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all sides and i pointed it out to my companions picture to yourselves said i what this crater must have been when filled with boiling lava and when the level of the incandescent liquid rose to the orifice of the mountain as though melted on the top of a hot plate i can picture it perfectly said conseil but sir will you tell me why the great architect has suspended operations and how it is that the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake most probably conseil because some convulsion beneath the ocean produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the nautilus then the waters of the atlantic rushed into the interior of the mountain there must have been a terrible struggle between the two elements a struggle which ended in the victory of neptune but many ages have run out since then and the submerged volcano is now a peaceable grotto very well replied ned land i accept the explanation sir but in our own interests i regret that the opening of which you speak was not made above the level of the sea but friend ned said conseil if the passage had not been under the sea the nautilus could not have gone through it we continued ascending the steps became more and more perpendicular and narrow deep excavations which we were obliged to cross cut them here and there sloping masses had to be turned we slid upon our knees and crawled along but conseils dexterity and the canadians strength surmounted all obstacles at a height of about 31 feet the nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable to the conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt the first dispread in layers full of bubbles the latter forming regular prisms placed like a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault an admirable specimen of natural architecture between the blocks of basalt wound long streams of lava long since grown cold encrusted with bituminous rays and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur a more powerful light shone through the upper crater shedding a vague glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of this extinguished mountain but our upward march was soon stopped at a height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles there was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us and our ascent was changed to a circular walk at the last change vegetable life began to struggle with the mineral some shrubs and even some trees grew from the fractures of the walls i recognised some euphorbias with the caustic sugar coming from them heliotropes quite incapable of justifying their name sadly drooped their clusters of flowers both their colour and perfume half gone here and there some chrysanthemums grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long sicklylooking leaves but between the streams of lava i saw some little violets still slightly perfumed and i admit that i smelt them with delight perfume is the soul of the flower and seaflowers have no soul we had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragontrees which had pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots when ned land exclaimed ah sir a hive a hive a hive i replied with a gesture of incredulity yes a hive repeated the canadian and bees humming round it i approached and was bound to believe my own eyes there at a hole bored in one of the dragontrees were some thousands of these ingenious insects so common in all the canaries and whose produce is so much esteemed naturally enough the canadian wished to gather the honey and i could not well oppose his wish a quantity of dry leaves mixed with sulphur he lit with a spark from his flint and he began to smoke out the bees the humming ceased by degrees and the hive eventually yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey with which ned land filled his haversack when i have mixed this honey with the paste of the breadfruit said he i shall be able to offer you a succulent cake transcribers note breadfruit has been substituted for artocarpus in this ed pon my word said conseil it will be gingerbread never mind the gingerbread said i let us continue our interesting walk at every turn of the path we were following the lake appeared in all its length and breadth the lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable surface which knew neither ripple nor wave the nautilus remained perfectly immovable on the platform and on the mountain the ships crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the luminous atmosphere we were now going round the highest crest of the first layers of rock which upheld the roof i then saw that bees were not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of this volcano birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows or fled from their nests on the top of the rocks there were sparrow hawks with white breasts and kestrels and down the slopes scampered with their long legs several fine fat bustards i leave anyone to imagine the covetousness of the canadian at the sight of this savoury game and whether he did not regret having no gun but he did his best to replace the lead by stones and after several fruitless attempts he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird to say that he risked his life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth but he managed so well that the creature joined the honeycakes in his bag we were now obliged to descend toward the shore the crest becoming impracticable above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a well from this place the sky could be clearly seen and clouds dissipated by the west wind leaving behind them even on the summit of the mountain their misty remnantscertain proof that they were only moderately high for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred feet above the level of the ocean half an hour after the canadians last exploit we had regained the inner shore here the flora was represented by large carpets of marine crystal a little umbelliferous plant very good to pickle which also bears the name of piercestone and seafennel conseil gathered some bundles of it as to the fauna it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts lobsters crabs spidercrabs chameleon shrimps and a large number of shells rockfish and limpets threequarters of an hour later we had finished our circuitous walk and were on board the crew had just finished loading the sodium and the nautilus could have left that instant but captain nemo gave no order did he wish to wait until night and leave the submarine passage secretly perhaps so whatever it might be the next day the nautilus having left its port steered clear of all land at a few yards beneath the waves of the atlantic the sargasso sea that day the nautilus crossed a singular part of the atlantic ocean no one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water known by the name of the gulf stream after leaving the gulf of florida we went in the direction of spitzbergen but before entering the gulf of mexico about 45 deg of n lat this current divides into two arms the principal one going towards the coast of ireland and norway whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the azores then touching the african shore and describing a lengthened oval returns to the antilles this second armit is rather a collar than an armsurrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of the cold quiet immovable ocean called the sargasso sea a perfect lake in the open atlantic it takes no less than three years for the great current to pass round it such was the region the nautilus was now visiting a perfect meadow a close carpet of seaweed fucus and tropical berries so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly tear its way through it and captain nemo not wishing to entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass kept some yards beneath the surface of the waves the name sargasso comes from the spanish word sargazzo which signifies kelp this kelp or berryplant is the principal formation of this immense bank and this is the reason why these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the atlantic the only explanation which can be given he says seems to me to result from the experience known to all the world place in a vase some fragments of cork or other floating body and give to the water in the vase a circular movement the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the centre of the liquid surface that is to say in the part least agitated in the phenomenon we are considering the atlantic is the vase the gulf stream the circular current and the sargasso sea the central point at which the floating bodies unite i share maurys opinion and i was able to study the phenomenon in the very midst where vessels rarely penetrate above us floated products of all kinds heaped up among these brownish plants trunks of trees torn from the andes or the rocky mountains and floated by the amazon or the mississippi numerous wrecks remains of keels or ships bottoms sideplanks stove in and so weighted with shells and barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface and time will one day justify maurys other opinion that these substances thus accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water and will then form inexhaustible coalminesa precious reserve prepared by farseeing nature for the moment when men shall have exhausted the mines of continents in the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed i noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae with their long tentacles trailing after them and medusae green red and blue all the day of the 22nd of february we passed in the sargasso sea where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant nourishment the next the ocean had returned to its accustomed aspect from this time for nineteen days from the 23rd of february to the 12th of march the nautilus kept in the middle of the atlantic carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twentyfour hours captain nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine programme and i imagined that he intended after doubling cape horn to return to the australian seas of the pacific ned land had cause for fear in these large seas void of islands we could not attempt to leave the boat nor had we any means of opposing captain nemos will our only course was to submit but what we could neither gain by force nor cunning i liked to think might be obtained by persuasion this voyage ended would he not consent to restore our liberty under an oath never to reveal his existencean oath of honour which we should have religiously kept but we must consider that delicate question with the captain but was i free to claim this liberty had he not himself said from the beginning in the firmest manner that the secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the nautilus and would not my four months silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation and would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our projects if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to return to them during the nineteen days mentioned above no incident of any kind happened to signalise our voyage i saw little of the captain he was at work in the library i often found his books left open especially those on natural history my work on submarine depths conned over by him was covered with marginal notes often contradicting my theories and systems but the captain contented himself with thus purging my work it was very rare for him to discuss it with me sometimes i heard the melancholy tones of his organ but only at night in the midst of the deepest obscurity when the nautilus slept upon the deserted ocean during this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on the surface of the waves the sea seemed abandoned a few sailingvessels on the road to india were making for the cape of good hope one day we were followed by the boats of a whaler who no doubt took us for some enormous whale of great price but captain nemo did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble so ended the chase by plunging under the water our navigation continued until the 13th of march that day the nautilus was employed in taking soundings which greatly interested me we had then made about 13000 leagues since our departure from the high seas of the pacific the bearings gave us 45 deg 37 s lat and 37 deg 53 w long it was the same water in which captain denham of the herald sounded 7000 fathoms without finding the bottom there too lieutenant parker of the american frigate congress could not touch the bottom with 15140 fathoms captain nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at an angle of 45 deg with the waterline of the nautilus then the screw set to work at its maximum speed its four blades beating the waves with in describable force under this powerful pressure the hull of the nautilus quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly under the water at 7000 fathoms i saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the waters but these summits might belong to high mountains like the himalayas or mont blanc even higher and the depth of the abyss remained incalculable the nautilus descended still lower in spite of the great pressure i felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings of the bolts its bars bent its partitions groaned the windows of the saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters and this firm structure would doubtless have yielded if as its captain had said it had not been capable of resistance like a solid block we had attained a depth of 16000 yards four leagues and the sides of the nautilus then bore a pressure of 1600 atmospheres that is to say 3200 lb to each square twofifths of an inch of its surface what a situation to be in i exclaimed to overrun these deep regions where man has never trod look captain look at these magnificent rocks these uninhabited grottoes these lowest receptacles of the globe where life is no longer possible what unknown sights are here why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them would you like to carry away more than the remembrance said captain nemo what do you mean by those words i mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view of this submarine region i had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition when at captain nemos call an objective was brought into the saloon through the widelyopened panel the liquid mass was bright with electricity which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow not a gradation was to be seen in our manufactured light the nautilus remained motionless the force of its screw subdued by the inclination of its planes the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic site and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative but the operation being over captain nemo said let us go up we must not abuse our position nor expose the nautilus too long to such great pressure go up again i exclaimed hold well on i had not time to understand why the captain cautioned me thus when i was thrown forward on to the carpet at a signal from the captain its screw was shipped and its blades raised vertically the nautilus shot into the air like a balloon rising with stunning rapidity and cutting the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation nothing was visible and in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which separated it from the ocean and after emerging like a flyingfish fell making the waves rebound to an enormous height cachalots and whales during the nights of the 13th and 14th of march the nautilus returned to its southerly course i fancied that when on a level with cape horn he would turn the helm westward in order to beat the pacific seas and so complete the tour of the world he did nothing of the kind but continued on his way to the southern regions where was he going to to the pole it was madness i began to think that the captains temerity justified ned lands fears for some time past the canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight he was less communicative almost silent i could see that this lengthened imprisonment was weighing upon him and i felt that rage was burning within him when he met the captain his eyes lit up with suppressed anger and i feared that his natural violence would lead him into some extreme that day the 14th of march conseil and he came to me in my room i inquired the cause of their visit a simple question to ask you sir replied the canadian speak ned how many men are there on board the nautilus do you think i cannot tell my friend i should say that its working does not require a large crew certainly under existing conditions ten men at the most ought to be enough well why should there be any more why i replied looking fixedly at ned land whose meaning was easy to guess because i added if my surmises are correct and if i have well understood the captains existence the nautilus is not only a vessel it is also a place of refuge for those who like its commander have broken every tie upon earth perhaps so said conseil but in any case the nautilus can only contain a certain number of men could not you sir estimate their maximum how conseil by calculation given the size of the vessel which you know sir and consequently the quantity of air it contains knowing also how much each man expends at a breath and comparing these results with the fact that the nautilus is obliged to go to the surface every twentyfour hours conseil had not finished the sentence before i saw what he was driving at i understand said i but that calculation though simple enough can give but a very uncertain result never mind said ned land urgently here it is then said i in one hour each man consumes the oxygen contained in twenty gallons of air and in twentyfour that contained in 480 gallons we must therefore find how many times 480 gallons of air the nautilus contains just so said conseil or i continued the size of the nautilus being 1500 tons and one ton holding 200 gallons it contains 300000 gallons of air which divided by 480 gives a quotient of 625 which means to say strictly speaking that the air contained in the nautilus would suffice for 625 men for twentyfour hours six hundred and twentyfive repeated ned but remember that all of us passengers sailors and officers included would not form a tenth part of that number still too many for three men murmured conseil the canadian shook his head passed his hand across his forehead and left the room without answering will you allow me to make one observation sir said conseil poor ned is longing for everything that he can not have his past life is always present to him everything that we are forbidden he regrets his head is full of old recollections and we must understand him what has he to do here nothing he is not learned like you sir and has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have he would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his own country certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the canadian accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity events were rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit but that day an event did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner about eleven in the morning being on the surface of the ocean the nautilus fell in with a troop of whalesan encounter which did not astonish me knowing that these creatures hunted to death had taken refuge in high latitudes we were seated on the platform with a quiet sea the month of october in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days it was the canadianhe could not be mistakenwho signalled a whale on the eastern horizon looking attentively one might see its black back rise and fall with the waves five miles from the nautilus ah exclaimed ned land if i was on board a whaler now such a meeting would give me pleasure it is one of large size see with what strength its blowholes throw up columns of air an steam confound it why am i bound to these steel plates what ned said i you have not forgotten your old ideas of fishing can a whalefisher ever forget his old trade sir can he ever tire of the emotions caused by such a chase you have never fished in these seas ned never sir in the northern only and as much in behring as in davis straits then the southern whale is still unknown to you it is the greenland whale you have hunted up to this time and that would not risk passing through the warm waters of the equator whales are localised according to their kinds in certain seas which they never leave and if one of these creatures went from behring to davis straits it must be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other either on the american or the asiatic side in that case as i have never fished in these seas i do not know the kind of whale frequenting them i have told you ned a greater reason for making their acquaintance said conseil look look exclaimed the canadian they approach they aggravate me they know that i cannot get at them ned stamped his feet his hand trembled as he grasped an imaginary harpoon are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas asked he very nearly ned because i have seen large whales sir whales measuring a hundred feet i have even been told that those of hullamoch and umgallick of the aleutian islands are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long that seems to me exaggeration these creatures are only balaeaopterons provided with dorsal fins and like the cachalots are generally much smaller than the greenland whale ah exclaimed the canadian whose eyes had never left the ocean they are coming nearer they are in the same water as the nautilus then returning to the conversation he said you spoke of the cachalot as a small creature i have heard of gigantic ones they are intelligent cetacea it is said of some that they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus and then are taken for islands people encamp upon them and settle there lights a fire and build houses said conseil yes joker said ned land and one fine day the creature plunges carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea something like the travels of sinbad the sailor i replied laughing ah suddenly exclaimed ned land it is not one whale there are tenthere are twentyit is a whole troop and i not able to do anything hands and feet tied but friend ned said conseil why do you not ask captain nemos permission to chase them conseil had not finished his sentence when ned land had lowered himself through the panel to seek the captain a few minutes afterwards the two appeared together on the platform captain nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a mile from the nautilus they are southern whales said he there goes the fortune of a whole fleet of whalers well sir asked the canadian can i not chase them if only to remind me of my old trade of harpooner and to what purpose replied captain nemo only to destroy we have nothing to do with the whaleoil on board but sir continued the canadian in the red sea you allowed us to follow the dugong then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew here it would be killing for killings sake i know that is a privilege reserved for man but i do not approve of such murderous pastime in destroying the southern whale like the greenland whale an inoffensive creature your traders do a culpable action master land they have already depopulated the whole of baffins bay and are annihilating a class of useful animals leave the unfortunate cetacea alone they have plenty of natural enemiescachalots swordfish and sawfishwithout you troubling them the captain was right the barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the ocean ned land whistled yankeedoodle between his teeth thrust his hands into his pockets and turned his back upon us but captain nemo watched the troop of cetacea and addressing me said i was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough without counting man these will have plenty to do before long do you see m aronnax about eight miles to leeward those blackish moving points yes captain i replied those are cachalotsterrible animals which i have met in troops of two or three hundred as to those they are cruel mischievous creatures they would be right in exterminating them the canadian turned quickly at the last words well captain said he it is still time in the interest of the whales it is useless to expose ones self professor the nautilus will disperse them it is armed with a steel spur as good as master lands harpoon i imagine the canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders attack cetacea with blows of a spur who had ever heard of such a thing wait m aronnax said captain nemo we will show you something you have never yet seen we have no pity for these ferocious creatures they are nothing but mouth and teeth mouth and teeth no one could better describe the macrocephalous cachalot which is sometimes more than seventyfive feet long its enormous head occupies onethird of its entire body better armed than the whale whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone it is supplied with twentyfive large tusks about eight inches long cylindrical and conical at the top each weighing two pounds it is in the upper part of this enormous head in great cavities divided by cartilages that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of that precious oil called spermaceti the cachalot is a disagreeable creature more tadpole than fish according to fredols description it is badly formed the whole of its left side being if we may say it a failure and being only able to see with its right eye but the formidable troop was nearing us they had seen the whales and were preparing to attack them one could judge beforehand that the cachalots would be victorious not only because they were better built for attack than their inoffensive adversaries but also because they could remain longer under water without coming to the surface there was only just time to go to the help of the whales the nautilus went under water conseil ned land and i took our places before the window in the saloon and captain nemo joined the pilot in his cage to work his apparatus as an engine of destruction soon i felt the beatings of the screw quicken and our speed increased the battle between the cachalots and the whales had already begun when the nautilus arrived they did not at first show any fear at the sight of this new monster joining in the conflict but they soon had to guard against its blows what a battle the nautilus was nothing but a formidable harpoon brandished by the hand of its captain it hurled itself against the fleshy mass passing through from one part to the other leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal it could not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides nor the shock which it produced itself much more one cachalot killed it ran at the next tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey going forwards and backwards answering to its helm plunging when the cetacean dived into the deep waters coming up with it when it returned to the surface striking it front or sideways cutting or tearing in all directions and at any pace piercing it with its terrible spur what carnage what a noise on the surface of the waves what sharp hissing and what snorting peculiar to these enraged animals in the midst of these waters generally so peaceful their tails made perfect billows for one hour this wholesale massacre continued from which the cachalots could not escape several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the nautilus by their weight from the window we could see their enormous mouths studded with tusks and their formidable eyes ned land could not contain himself he threatened and swore at them we could feel them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a wild boar in a copse but the nautilus working its screw carried them here and there or to the upper levels of the ocean without caring for their enormous weight nor the powerful strain on the vessel at length the mass of cachalots broke up the waves became quiet and i felt that we were rising to the surface the panel opened and we hurried on to the platform the sea was covered with mutilated bodies a formidable explosion could not have divided and torn this fleshy mass with more violence we were floating amid gigantic bodies bluish on the back and white underneath covered with enormous protuberances some terrified cachalots were flying towards the horizon the waves were dyed red for several miles and the nautilus floated in a sea of blood captain nemo joined us well master land said he well sir replied the canadian whose enthusiasm had somewhat calmed it is a terrible spectacle certainly but i am not a butcher i am a hunter and i call this a butchery it is a massacre of mischievous creatures replied the captain and the nautilus is not a butchers knife i like my harpoon better said the canadian every one to his own answered the captain looking fixedly at ned land i feared he would commit some act of violence which would end in sad consequences but his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which the nautilus had just come up with the creature had not quite escaped from the cachalots teeth i recognised the southern whale by its flat head which is entirely black anatomically it is distinguished from the white whale and the north cape whale by the seven cervical vertebrae and it has two more ribs than its congeners the unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side riddled with holes from the bites and quite dead from its mutilated fin still hung a young whale which it could not save from the massacre its open mouth let the water flow in and out murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore captain nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature two of his men mounted its side and i saw not without surprise that they were drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained that is to say about two or three tons the captain offered me a cup of the milk which was still warm i could not help showing my repugnance to the drink but he assured me that it was excellent and not to be distinguished from cows milk i tasted it and was of his opinion it was a useful reserve to us for in the shape of salt butter or cheese it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food from that day i noticed with uneasiness that ned lands illwill towards captain nemo increased and i resolved to watch the canadians gestures closely the iceberg the nautilus was steadily pursuing its southerly course following the fiftieth meridian with considerable speed did he wish to reach the pole i did not think so for every attempt to reach that point had hitherto failed again the season was far advanced for in the antarctic regions the 13th of march corresponds with the 13th of september of northern regions which begin at the equinoctial season on the 14th of march i saw floating ice in latitude 55 deg merely pale bits of debris from twenty to twentyfive feet long forming banks over which the sea curled the nautilus remained on the surface of the ocean ned land who had fished in the arctic seas was familiar with its icebergs but conseil and i admired them for the first time in the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling band english whalers have given it the name of ice blink however thick the clouds may be it is always visible and announces the presence of an ice pack or bank accordingly larger blocks soon appeared whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog some of these masses showed green veins as if long undulating lines had been traced with sulphate of copper others resembled enormous amethysts with the light shining through them some reflected the light of day upon a thousand crystal facets others shaded with vivid calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble the more we neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in number and importance at 60 deg lat every pass had disappeared but seeking carefully captain nemo soon found a narrow opening through which he boldly slipped knowing however that it would close behind him thus guided by this clever hand the nautilus passed through all the ice with a precision which quite charmed conseil icebergs or mountains icefields or smooth plains seeming to have no limits driftice or floating icepacks plains broken up called palchs when they are circular and streams when they are made up of long strips the temperature was very low the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2 deg or 3 deg below zero but we were warmly clad with fur at the expense of the seabear and seal the interior of the nautilus warmed regularly by its electric apparatus defied the most intense cold besides it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the waves to find a more bearable temperature two months earlier we should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes but already we had had three or four hours of night and by and by there would be six months of darkness in these circumpolar regions on the 15th of march we were in the latitude of new shetland and south orkney the captain told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them but that english and american whalers in their rage for destruction massacred both old and young thus where there was once life and animation they had left silence and death about eight oclock on the morning of the 16th of march the nautilus following the fiftyfifth meridian cut the antarctic polar circle ice surrounded us on all sides and closed the horizon but captain nemo went from one opening to another still going higher i cannot express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions the ice took most surprising forms here the grouping formed an oriental town with innumerable mosques and minarets there a fallen city thrown to the earth as it were by some convulsion of nature the whole aspect was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun or lost in the greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow detonations and falls were heard on all sides great overthrows of icebergs which altered the whole landscape like a diorama often seeing no exit i thought we were definitely prisoners but instinct guiding him at the slightest indication captain nemo would discover a new pass he was never mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along the icefields and i had no doubt that he had already ventured into the midst of these antarctic seas before on the 16th of march however the icefields absolutely blocked our road it was not the iceberg itself as yet but vast fields cemented by the cold but this obstacle could not stop captain nemo he hurled himself against it with frightful violence the nautilus entered the brittle mass like a wedge and split it with frightful crackings it was the battering ram of the ancients hurled by infinite strength the ice thrown high in the air fell like hail around us by its own power of impulsion our apparatus made a canal for itself some times carried away by its own impetus it lodged on the icefield crushing it with its weight and sometimes buried beneath it dividing it by a simple pitching movement producing large rents in it violent gales assailed us at this time accompanied by thick fogs through which from one end of the platform to the other we could see nothing the wind blew sharply from all parts of the compass and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had to break it with blows of a pickaxe the temperature was always at 5 deg below zero every outward part of the nautilus was covered with ice a rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up gorges a vessel without sails with electricity for its motive power and wanting no coal could alone brave such high latitudes at length on the 18th of march after many useless assaults the nautilus was positively blocked it was no longer either streams packs or icefields but an interminable and immovable barrier formed by mountains soldered together an iceberg said the canadian to me i knew that to ned land as well as to all other navigators who had preceded us this was an inevitable obstacle the sun appearing for an instant at noon captain nemo took an observation as near as possible which gave our situation at 51 deg 30 long and 67 deg 39 of s lat we had advanced one degree more in this antarctic region of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse under the spur of the nautilus lay stretched a vast plain entangled with confused blocks here and there sharp points and slender needles rising to a height of 200 feet further on a steep shore hewn as it were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints huge mirrors reflecting a few rays of sunshine half drowned in the fog and over this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned scarcely broken by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins everything was frozeneven the noise the nautilus was then obliged to stop in its adventurous course amid these fields of ice in spite of our efforts in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice the nautilus remained immovable generally when we can proceed no further we have return still open to us but here return was as impossible as advance for every pass had closed behind us and for the few moments when we were stationary we were likely to be entirely blocked which did indeed happen about two oclock in the afternoon the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity i was obliged to admit that captain nemo was more than imprudent i was on the platform at that moment the captain had been observing our situation for some time past when he said to me well sir what do you think of this i think that we are caught captain so m aronnax you really think that the nautilus cannot disengage itself with difficulty captain for the season is already too far advanced for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice ah sir said captain nemo in an ironical tone you will always be the same you see nothing but difficulties and obstacles i affirm that not only can the nautilus disengage itself but also that it can go further still further to the south i asked looking at the captain yes sir it shall go to the pole to the pole i exclaimed unable to repress a gesture of incredulity yes replied the captain coldly to the antarctic poleto that unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe you know whether i can do as i please with the nautilus yes i knew that i knew that this man was bold even to rashness but to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the south pole rendering it more inaccessible than the north which had not yet been reached by the boldest navigatorswas it not a mad enterprise one which only a maniac would have conceived it then came into my head to ask captain nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never yet been trodden by a human creature no sir he replied but we will discover it together where others have failed i will not fail i have never yet led my nautilus so far into southern seas but i repeat it shall go further yet i can well believe you captain said i in a slightly ironical tone i believe you let us go ahead there are no obstacles for us let us smash this iceberg let us blow it up and if it resists let us give the nautilus wings to fly over it over it sir said captain nemo quietly no not over it but under it under it i exclaimed a sudden idea of the captains projects flashing upon my mind i understood the wonderful qualities of the nautilus were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise i see we are beginning to understand one another sir said the captain half smiling you begin to see the possibilityi should say the successof this attempt that which is impossible for an ordinary vessel is easy to the nautilus if a continent lies before the pole it must stop before the continent but if on the contrary the pole is washed by open sea it will go even to the pole certainly said i carried away by the captains reasoning if the surface of the sea is solidified by the ice the lower depths are free by the providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezingpoint and if i am not mistaken the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is as one to four to that which is below very nearly sir for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are three below it if these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet above the surface they are not more than 900 beneath and what are 900 feet to the nautilus nothing sir it could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of seawater and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of surface cold just so sirjust so i replied getting animated the only difficulty continued captain nemo is that of remaining several days without renewing our provision of air is that all the nautilus has vast reservoirs we can fill them and they will supply us with all the oxygen we want well thought of m aronnax replied the captain smiling but not wishing you to accuse me of rashness i will first give you all my objections have you any more to make only one it is possible if the sea exists at the south pole that it may be covered and consequently we shall be unable to come to the surface good sir but do you forget that the nautilus is armed with a powerful spur and could we not send it diagonally against these fields of ice which would open at the shocks ah sir you are full of ideas today besides captain i added enthusiastically why should we not find the sea open at the south pole as well as at the north the frozen poles of the earth do not coincide either in the southern or in the northern regions and until it is proved to the contrary we may suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two points of the globe i think so too m aronnax replied captain nemo i only wish you to observe that after having made so many objections to my project you are now crushing me with arguments in its favour the preparations for this audacious attempt now began the powerful pumps of the nautilus were working air into the reservoirs and storing it at high pressure about four oclock captain nemo announced the closing of the panels on the platform i threw one last look at the massive iceberg which we were going to cross the weather was clear the atmosphere pure enough the cold very great being 12 deg below zero but the wind having gone down this temperature was not so unbearable about ten men mounted the sides of the nautilus armed with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel which was soon free the operation was quickly performed for the fresh ice was still very thin we all went below the usual reservoirs were filled with the newlyliberated water and the nautilus soon descended i had taken my place with conseil in the saloon through the open window we could see the lower beds of the southern ocean the thermometer went up the needle of the compass deviated on the dial at about 900 feet as captain nemo had foreseen we were floating beneath the undulating bottom of the iceberg but the nautilus went lower stillit went to the depth of four hundred fathoms the temperature of the water at the surface showed twelve degrees it was now only ten we had gained two i need not say the temperature of the nautilus was raised by its heating apparatus to a much higher degree every manoeuvre was accomplished with wonderful precision we shall pass it if you please sir said conseil i believe we shall i said in a tone of firm conviction in this open sea the nautilus had taken its course direct to the pole without leaving the fiftysecond meridian from 67 deg 30 to 90 deg twentytwo degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel that is about five hundred leagues the nautilus kept up a mean speed of twentysix miles an hourthe speed of an express train if that was kept up in forty hours we should reach the pole for a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the window the sea was lit with the electric lantern but it was deserted fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters they only found there a passage to take them from the antarctic ocean to the open polar sea our pace was rapid we could feel it by the quivering of the long steel body about two in the morning i took some hours repose and conseil did the same in crossing the waist i did not meet captain nemo i supposed him to be in the pilots cage the next morning the 19th of march i took my post once more in the saloon the electric log told me that the speed of the nautilus had been slackened it was then going towards the surface but prudently emptying its reservoirs very slowly my heart beat fast were we going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere no a shock told me that the nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg still very thick judging from the deadened sound we had in deed struck to use a sea expression but in an inverse sense and at a thousand feet deep this would give three thousand feet of ice above us one thousand being above the watermark the iceberg was then higher than at its bordersnot a very reassuring fact several times that day the nautilus tried again and every time it struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above it sometimes it met with but 900 yards only 200 of which rose above the surface it was twice the height it was when the nautilus had gone under the waves i carefully noted the different depths and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was developed under the water that night no change had taken place in our situation still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth it was evidently diminishing but still what a thickness between us and the surface of the ocean it was then eight according to the daily custom on board the nautilus its air should have been renewed four hours ago but i did not suffer much although captain nemo had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen my sleep was painful that night hope and fear besieged me by turns i rose several times the groping of the nautilus continued about three in the morning i noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet deep one hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of the waters the iceberg was by degrees becoming an icefield the mountain a plain my eyes never left the manometer we were still rising diagonally to the surface which sparkled under the electric rays the iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into lengthening slopes mile after mile it was getting thinner at length at six in the morning of that memorable day the 19th of march the door of the saloon opened and captain nemo appeared the sea is open was all he said the south pole i rushed on to the platform yes the open sea with but a few scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergsa long stretch of sea a world of birds in the air and myriads of fishes under those waters which varied from intense blue to olive green according to the bottom the thermometer marked 3 deg c above zero it was comparatively spring shut up as we were behind this iceberg whose lengthened mass was dimly seen on our northern horizon are we at the pole i asked the captain with a beating heart i do not know he replied at noon i will take our bearings but will the sun show himself through this fog said i looking at the leaden sky however little it shows it will be enough replied the captain about ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred and four yards we made for it but carefully for the sea might be strewn with banks one hour afterwards we had reached it two hours later we had made the round of it it measured four or five miles in circumference a narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch of land perhaps a continent for we could not see its limits the existence of this land seemed to give some colour to maurys theory the ingenious american has remarked that between the south pole and the sixtieth parallel the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous size which is never met with in the north atlantic from this fact he has drawn the conclusion that the antarctic circle encloses considerable continents as icebergs cannot form in open sea but only on the coasts according to these calculations the mass of ice surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap the circumference of which must be at least 2500 miles but the nautilus for fear of running aground had stopped about three cablelengths from a strand over which reared a superb heap of rocks the boat was launched the captain two of his men bearing instruments conseil and myself were in it it was ten in the morning i had not seen ned land doubtless the canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the south pole a few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand where we ran ashore conseil was going to jump on to the land when i held him back sir said i to captain nemo to you belongs the honour of first setting foot on this land yes sir said the captain and if i do not hesitate to tread this south pole it is because up to this time no human being has left a trace there saying this he jumped lightly on to the sand his heart beat with emotion he climbed a rock sloping to a little promontory and there with his arms crossed mute and motionless and with an eager look he seemed to take possession of these southern regions after five minutes passed in this ecstasy he turned to us when you like sir i landed followed by conseil leaving the two men in the boat for a long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone something like crushed brick scoriae streams of lava and pumicestones one could not mistake its volcanic origin in some parts slight curls of smoke emitted a sulphurous smell proving that the internal fires had lost nothing of their expansive powers though having climbed a high acclivity i could see no volcano for a radius of several miles we know that in those antarctic countries james ross found two craters the erebus and terror in full activity on the 167th meridian latitude 77 deg 32 the vegetation of this desolate continent seemed to me much restricted some lichens lay upon the black rocks some microscopic plants rudimentary diatomas a kind of cells placed between two quartz shells long purple and scarlet weed supported on little swimming bladders which the breaking of the waves brought to the shore these constituted the meagre flora of this region the shore was strewn with molluscs little mussels and limpets i also saw myriads of northern clios oneandaquarter inches long of which a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful and some perfect seabutterflies animating the waters on the skirts of the shore there appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs of the kind which according to james ross live in the antarctic seas to the depth of more than 1000 yards then there were little kingfishers and starfish studding the soil but where life abounded most was in the air there thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds deafening us with their cries others crowded the rock looking at us as we passed by without fear and pressing familiarly close by our feet there were penguins so agile in the water heavy and awkward as they are on the ground they were uttering harsh cries a large assembly sober in gesture but extravagant in clamour albatrosses passed in the air the expanse of their wings being at least four yards and a half and justly called the vultures of the ocean some gigantic petrels and some damiers a kind of small duck the underpart of whose body is black and white then there were a whole series of petrels some whitish with brownbordered wings others blue peculiar to the antarctic seas and so oily as i told conseil that the inhabitants of the ferroe islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a wick in a little more said conseil and they would be perfect lamps after that we cannot expect nature to have previously furnished them with wicks about half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs nests a sort of layingground out of which many birds were issuing captain nemo had some hundreds hunted they uttered a cry like the braying of an ass were about the size of a goose slatecolour on the body white beneath with a yellow line round their throats they allowed themselves to be killed with a stone never trying to escape but the fog did not lift and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself its absence made me uneasy without it no observations were possible how then could we decide whether we had reached the pole when i rejoined captain nemo i found him leaning on a piece of rock silently watching the sky he seemed impatient and vexed but what was to be done this rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did the sea noon arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an instant we could not even tell its position behind the curtain of fog and soon the fog turned to snow till tomorrow said the captain quietly and we returned to the nautilus amid these atmospheric disturbances the tempest of snow continued till the next day it was impossible to remain on the platform from the saloon where i was taking notes of incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent i could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst of this violent storm the nautilus did not remain motionless but skirted the coast advancing ten miles more to the south in the halflight left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon the next day the 20th of march the snow had ceased the cold was a little greater the thermometer showing 2 deg below zero the fog was rising and i hoped that that day our observations might be taken captain nemo not having yet appeared the boat took conseil and myself to land the soil was still of the same volcanic nature everywhere were traces of lava scoriae and basalt but the crater which had vomited them i could not see here as lower down this continent was alive with myriads of birds but their rule was now divided with large troops of seamammals looking at us with their soft eyes there were several kinds of seals some stretched on the earth some on flakes of ice many going in and out of the sea they did not flee at our approach never having had anything to do with man and i reckoned that there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels sir said conseil will you tell me the names of these creatures they are seals and morses it was now eight in the morning four hours remained to us before the sun could be observed with advantage i directed our steps towards a vast bay cut in the steep granite shore there i can aver that earth and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of seamammals covering them and i involuntarily sought for old proteus the mythological shepherd who watched these immense flocks of neptune there were more seals than anything else forming distinct groups male and female the father watching over his family the mother suckling her little ones some already strong enough to go a few steps when they wished to change their place they took little jumps made by the contraction of their bodies and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin which as with the lamantin their cousins forms a perfect forearm i should say that in the water which is their elementthe spine of these creatures is flexible with smooth and close skin and webbed feetthey swim admirably in resting on the earth they take the most graceful attitudes thus the ancients observing their soft and expressive looks which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can give their clear voluptuous eyes their charming positions and the poetry of their manners metamorphosed them the male into a triton and the female into a mermaid i made conseil notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in these interesting cetaceans no mammal except man has such a quantity of brain matter they are also capable of receiving a certain amount of education are easily domesticated and i think with other naturalists that if properly taught they would be of great service as fishingdogs the greater part of them slept on the rocks or on the sand amongst these seals properly so called which have no external ears in which they differ from the otter whose ears are prominent i noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long with a white coat bulldog heads armed with teeth in both jaws four incisors at the top and four at the bottom and two large canine teeth in the shape of a fleurdelis amongst them glided seaelephants a kind of seal with short flexible trunks the giants of this species measured twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length but they did not move as we approached these creatures are not dangerous asked conseil no not unless you attack them when they have to defend their young their rage is terrible and it is not uncommon for them to break the fishingboats to pieces they are quite right said conseil i do not say they are not two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters the bay from the southerly winds beyond it we heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce good said conseil a concert of bulls no a concert of morses they are fighting they are either fighting or playing we now began to climb the blackish rocks amid unforeseen stumbles and over stones which the ice made slippery more than once i rolled over at the expense of my loins conseil more prudent or more steady did not stumble and helped me up saying if sir you would have the kindness to take wider steps you would preserve your equilibrium better arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory i saw a vast white plain covered with morses they were playing amongst themselves and what we heard were bellowings of pleasure not of anger as i passed these curious animals i could examine them leisurely for they did not move their skins were thick and rugged of a yellowish tint approaching to red their hair was short and scant some of them were four yards and a quarter long quieter and less timid than their cousins of the north they did not like them place sentinels round the outskirts of their encampment after examining this city of morses i began to think of returning it was eleven oclock and if captain nemo found the conditions favourable for observations i wished to be present at the operation we followed a narrow pathway running along the summit of the steep shore at halfpast eleven we had reached the place where we landed the boat had run aground bringing the captain i saw him standing on a block of basalt his instruments near him his eyes fixed on the northern horizon near which the sun was then describing a lengthened curve i took my place beside him and waited without speaking noon arrived and as before the sun did not appear it was a fatality observations were still wanting if not accomplished tomorrow we must give up all idea of taking any we were indeed exactly at the 20th of march tomorrow the 21st would be the equinox the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six months and with its disappearance the long polar night would begin since the september equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of december at this period the summer solstice of the northern regions it had begun to descend and tomorrow was to shed its last rays upon them i communicated my fears and observations to captain nemo you are right m aronnax said he if tomorrow i cannot take the altitude of the sun i shall not be able to do it for six months but precisely because chance has led me into these seas on the 21st of march my bearings will be easy to take if at twelve we can see the sun why captain because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it is difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon and grave errors may be made with instruments what will you do then i shall only use my chronometer replied captain nemo if tomorrow the 21st of march the disc of the sun allowing for refraction is exactly cut by the northern horizon it will show that i am at the south pole just so said i but this statement is not mathematically correct because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon very likely sir but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do not want more till tomorrow then captain nemo returned on board conseil and i remained to survey the shore observing and studying until five oclock then i went to bed not however without invoking like the indian the favour of the radiant orb the next day the 21st of march at five in the morning i mounted the platform i found captain nemo there the weather is lightening a little said he i have some hope after breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation that point settled i sought ned land i wanted to take him with me but the obstinate canadian refused and i saw that his taciturnity and his bad humour grew day by day after all i was not sorry for his obstinacy under the circumstances indeed there were too many seals on shore and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting fishermans way breakfast over we went on shore the nautilus had gone some miles further up in the night it was a whole league from the coast above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high the boat took with me captain nemo two men of the crew and the instruments which consisted of a chronometer a telescope and a barometer while crossing i saw numerous whales belonging to the three kinds peculiar to the southern seas the whale or the english right whale which has no dorsal fin the humpback with reeved chest and large whitish fins which in spite of its name do not form wings and the finback of a yellowish brown the liveliest of all the cetacea this powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws to a great height columns of air and vapour which look like whirlwinds of smoke these different mammals were disporting themselves in troops in the quiet waters and i could see that this basin of the antarctic pole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by the hunters i also noticed large medusae floating between the reeds at nine we landed the sky was brightening the clouds were flying to the south and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the waters captain nemo went towards the peak which he doubtless meant to be his observatory it was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and the pumicestones in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous smell from the smoking cracks for a man unaccustomed to walk on land the captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility i never saw equalled and which a hunter would have envied we were two hours getting to the summit of this peak which was half porphyry and half basalt from thence we looked upon a vast sea which towards the north distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky at our feet lay fields of dazzling whiteness over our heads a pale azure free from fog to the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire already horned by the cutting of the horizon from the bosom of the water rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds in the distance lay the nautilus like a cetacean asleep on the water behind us to the south and east an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice the limits of which were not visible on arriving at the summit captain nemo carefully took the mean height of the barometer for he would have to consider that in taking his observations at a quarter to twelve the sun then seen only by refraction looked like a golden disc shedding its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had yet ploughed captain nemo furnished with a lenticular glass which by means of a mirror corrected the refraction watched the orb sinking below the horizon by degrees following a lengthened diagonal i held the chronometer my heart beat fast if the disappearance of the halfdisc of the sun coincided with twelve oclock on the chronometer we were at the pole itself twelve i exclaimed the south pole replied captain nemo in a grave voice handing me the glass which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the horizon i looked at the last rays crowning the peak and the shadows mounting by degrees up its slopes at that moment captain nemo resting with his hand on my shoulder said i captain nemo on this 21st day of march 1868 have reached the south pole on the ninetieth degree and i take possession of this part of the globe equal to onesixth of the known continents in whose name captain in my own sir saying which captain nemo unfurled a black banner bearing an n in gold quartered on its bunting then turning towards the orb of day whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea he exclaimed adieu sun disappear thou radiant orb rest beneath this open sea and let a night of six months spread its shadows over my new domains accident or incident the next day the 22nd of march at six in the morning preparations for departure were begun the last gleams of twilight were melting into night the cold was great the constellations shone with wonderful intensity in the zenith glittered that wondrous southern crossthe polar bear of antarctic regions the thermometer showed 120 below zero and when the wind freshened it was most biting flakes of ice increased on the open water the sea seemed everywhere alike numerous blackish patches spread on the surface showing the formation of fresh ice evidently the southern basin frozen during the six winter months was absolutely inaccessible what became of the whales in that time doubtless they went beneath the icebergs seeking more practicable seas as to the seals and morses accustomed to live in a hard climate they remained on these icy shores these creatures have the instinct to break holes in the icefield and to keep them open to these holes they come for breath when the birds driven away by the cold have emigrated to the north these sea mammals remain sole masters of the polar continent but the reservoirs were filling with water and the nautilus was slowly descending at 1000 feet deep it stopped its screw beat the waves and it advanced straight towards the north at a speed of fifteen miles an hour towards night it was already floating under the immense body of the iceberg at three in the morning i was awakened by a violent shock i sat up in my bed and listened in the darkness when i was thrown into the middle of the room the nautilus after having struck had rebounded violently i groped along the partition and by the staircase to the saloon which was lit by the luminous ceiling the furniture was upset fortunately the windows were firmly set and had held fast the pictures on the starboard side from being no longer vertical were clinging to the paper whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from the wall the nautilus was lying on its starboard side perfectly motionless i heard footsteps and a confusion of voices but captain nemo did not appear as i was leaving the saloon ned land and conseil entered what is the matter said i at once i came to ask you sir replied conseil confound it exclaimed the canadian i know well enough the nautilus has struck and judging by the way she lies i do not think she will right herself as she did the first time in torres straits but i asked has she at least come to the surface of the sea we do not know said conseil it is easy to decide i answered i consulted the manometer to my great surprise it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms what does that mean i exclaimed we must ask captain nemo said conseil but where shall we find him said ned land follow me said i to my companions we left the saloon there was no one in the library at the centre staircase by the berths of the ships crew there was no one i thought that captain nemo must be in the pilots cage it was best to wait we all returned to the saloon for twenty minutes we remained thus trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board the nautilus when captain nemo entered he seemed not to see us his face generally so impassive showed signs of uneasiness he watched the compass silently then the manometer and going to the planisphere placed his finger on a spot representing the southern seas i would not interrupt him but some minutes later when he turned towards me i said using one of his own expressions in the torres straits an incident captain no sir an accident this time serious perhaps is the danger immediate no the nautilus has stranded yes and this has happenedhow from a caprice of nature not from the ignorance of man not a mistake has been made in the working but we cannot prevent equilibrium from producing its effects we may brave human laws but we cannot resist natural ones captain nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this philosophical reflection on the whole his answer helped me little may i ask sir the cause of this accident an enormous block of ice a whole mountain has turned over he replied when icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water or reiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises and the whole thing turns over this is what has happened one of these blocks as it fell struck the nautilus then gliding under its hull raised it with irresistible force bringing it into beds which are not so thick where it is lying on its side but can we not get the nautilus off by emptying its reservoirs that it might regain its equilibrium that sir is being done at this moment you can hear the pump working look at the needle of the manometer it shows that the nautilus is rising but the block of ice is floating with it and until some obstacle stops its ascending motion our position cannot be altered indeed the nautilus still held the same position to starboard doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped but at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces i reflected on all the consequences of our position captain nemo never took his eyes off the manometer since the fall of the iceberg the nautilus had risen about a hundred and fifty feet but it still made the same angle with the perpendicular suddenly a slight movement was felt in the hold evidently it was righting a little things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal position the partitions were nearing the upright no one spoke with beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening the boards became horizontal under our feet ten minutes passed at last we have righted i exclaimed yes said captain nemo going to the door of the saloon but are we floating i asked certainly he replied since the reservoirs are not empty and when empty the nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea we were in open sea but at a distance of about ten yards on either side of the nautilus rose a dazzling wall of ice above and beneath the same wall above because the lower surface of the iceberg stretched over us like an immense ceiling beneath because the overturned block having slid by degrees had found a restingplace on the lateral walls which kept it in that position the nautilus was really imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in breadth filled with quiet water it was easy to get out of it by going either forward or backward and then make a free passage under the iceberg some hundreds of yards deeper the luminous ceiling had been extinguished but the saloon was still resplendent with intense light it was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent violently back to the sheets of the lantern i cannot describe the effect of the voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut upon every angle every ridge every facet was thrown a different light according to the nature of the veins running through the ice a dazzling mine of gems particularly of sapphires their blue rays crossing with the green of the emerald here and there were opal shades of wonderful softness running through bright spots like diamonds of fire the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear the power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold like a lamp through the lenticular plates of a firstclass lighthouse how beautiful how beautiful cried conseil yes i said it is a wonderful sight is it not ned yes confound it yes answered ned land it is superb i am mad at being obliged to admit it no one has ever seen anything like it but the sight may cost us dear and if i must say all i think we are seeing here things which god never intended man to see ned was right it was too beautiful suddenly a cry from conseil made me turn what is it i asked shut your eyes sir do not look sir saying which conseil clapped his hands over his eyes but what is the matter my boy i am dazzled blinded my eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass but i could not stand the fire which seemed to devour them i understood what had happened the nautilus had put on full speed all the quiet lustre of the icewalls was at once changed into flashes of lightning the fire from these myriads of diamonds was blinding it required some time to calm our troubled looks at last the hands were taken down faith i should never have believed it said conseil it was then five in the morning and at that moment a shock was felt at the bows of the nautilus i knew that its spur had struck a block of ice it must have been a false manoeuvre for this submarine tunnel obstructed by blocks was not very easy navigation i thought that captain nemo by changing his course would either turn these obstacles or else follow the windings of the tunnel in any case the road before us could not be entirely blocked but contrary to my expectations the nautilus took a decided retrograde motion we are going backwards said conseil yes i replied this end of the tunnel can have no egress and then then said i the working is easy we must go back again and go out at the southern opening that is all in speaking thus i wished to appear more confident than i really was but the retrograde motion of the nautilus was increasing and reversing the screw it carried us at great speed it will be a hindrance said ned what does it matter some hours more or less provided we get out at last yes repeated ned land provided we do get out at last for a short time i walked from the saloon to the library my companions were silent i soon threw myself on an ottoman and took a book which my eyes overran mechanically a quarter of an hour after conseil approaching me said is what you are reading very interesting sir very interesting i replied i should think so sir it is your own book you are reading my book and indeed i was holding in my hand the work on the great submarine depths i did not even dream of it i closed the book and returned to my walk ned and conseil rose to go stay here my friends said i detaining them let us remain together until we are out of this block as you please sir conseil replied some hours passed i often looked at the instruments hanging from the partition the manometer showed that the nautilus kept at a constant depth of more than three hundred yards the compass still pointed to south the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour which in such a cramped space was very great but captain nemo knew that he could not hasten too much and that minutes were worth ages to us at twentyfive minutes past eight a second shock took place this time from behind i turned pale my companions were close by my side i seized conseils hand our looks expressed our feelings better than words at this moment the captain entered the saloon i went up to him our course is barred southward i asked yes sir the iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet we are blocked up then yes want of air thus around the nautilus above and below was an impenetrable wall of ice we were prisoners to the iceberg i watched the captain his countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability gentlemen he said calmly there are two ways of dying in the circumstances in which we are placed this puzzling person had the air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils the first is to be crushed the second is to die of suffocation i do not speak of the possibility of dying of hunger for the supply of provisions in the nautilus will certainly last longer than we shall let us then calculate our chances as to suffocation captain i replied that is not to be feared because our reservoirs are full just so but they will only yield two days supply of air now for thirtysix hours we have been hidden under the water and already the heavy atmosphere of the nautilus requires renewal in fortyeight hours our reserve will be exhausted well captain can we be delivered before fortyeight hours we will attempt it at least by piercing the wall that surrounds us on which side sound will tell us i am going to run the nautilus aground on the lower bank and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is least thick captain nemo went out soon i discovered by a hissing noise that the water was entering the reservoirs the nautilus sank slowly and rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards the depth at which the lower bank was immersed my friends i said our situation is serious but i rely on your courage and energy sir replied the canadian i am ready to do anything for the general safety good ned and i held out my hand to the canadian i will add he continued that being as handy with the pickaxe as with the harpoon if i can be useful to the captain he can command my services he will not refuse your help come ned i led him to the room where the crew of the nautilus were putting on their corkjackets i told the captain of neds proposal which he accepted the canadian put on his seacostume and was ready as soon as his companions when ned was dressed i reentered the drawingroom where the panes of glass were open and posted near conseil i examined the ambient beds that supported the nautilus some instants after we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice and among them ned land easily known by his stature captain nemo was with them before proceeding to dig the walls he took the soundings to be sure of working in the right direction long sounding lines were sunk in the side walls but after fifteen yards they were again stopped by the thick wall it was useless to attack it on the ceilinglike surface since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in height captain nemo then sounded the lower surface there ten yards of wall separated us from the water so great was the thickness of the icefield it was necessary therefore to cut from it a piece equal in extent to the waterline of the nautilus there were about 6000 cubic yards to detach so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the icefield the work had begun immediately and carried on with indefatigable energy instead of digging round the nautilus which would have involved greater difficulty captain nemo had an immense trench made at eight yards from the portquarter then the men set to work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its circumference presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter vigorously and large blocks were detached from the mass by a curious effect of specific gravity these blocks lighter than water fled so to speak to the vault of the tunnel that increased in thickness at the top in proportion as it diminished at the base but that mattered little so long as the lower part grew thinner after two hours hard work ned land came in exhausted he and his comrades were replaced by new workers whom conseil and i joined the second lieutenant of the nautilus superintended us the water seemed singularly cold but i soon got warm handling the pickaxe my movements were free enough although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres when i reentered after working two hours to take some food and rest i found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the nautilus already charged with carbonic acid the air had not been renewed for fortyeight hours and its vivifying qualities were considerably enfeebled however after a lapse of twelve hours we had only raised a block of ice one yard thick on the marked surface which was about 600 cubic yards reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish this much it would take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion five nights and four days and we have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs without taking into account said ned that even if we get out of this infernal prison we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg shut out from all possible communication with the atmosphere true enough who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our deliverance we might be suffocated before the nautilus could regain the surface of the waves was it destined to perish in this icetomb with all those it enclosed the situation was terrible but everyone had looked the danger in the face and each was determined to do his duty to the last as i expected during the night a new block a yard square was carried away and still further sank the immense hollow but in the morning when dressed in my corkjacket i traversed the slushy mass at a temperature of six or seven degrees below zero i remarked that the side walls were gradually closing in the beds of water farthest from the trench that were not warmed by the mens work showed a tendency to solidification in presence of this new and imminent danger what would become of our chances of safety and how hinder the solidification of this liquid medium that would burst the partitions of the nautilus like glass i did not tell my companions of this new danger what was the good of damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape but when i went on board again i told captain nemo of this grave complication i know it he said in that calm tone which could counteract the most terrible apprehensions it is one danger more but i see no way of escaping it the only chance of safety is to go quicker than solidification we must be beforehand with it that is all on this day for several hours i used my pickaxe vigorously the work kept me up besides to work was to quit the nautilus and breathe directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs and supplied by our apparatus and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper when i returned on board i was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air was filledah if we had only the chemical means to drive away this deleterious gas we had plenty of oxygen all this water contained a considerable quantity and by dissolving it with our powerful piles it would restore the vivifying fluid i had thought well over it but of what good was that since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration had invaded every part of the vessel to absorb it it was necessary to fill some jars with caustic potash and to shake them incessantly now this substance was wanting on board and nothing could replace it on that evening captain nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs and let some pure air into the interior of the nautilus without this precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation the next day march 26th i resumed my miners work in beginning the fifth yard the side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly it was evident that they would meet before the nautilus was able to disengage itself despair seized me for an instant my pickaxe nearly fell from my hands what was the good of digging if i must be suffocated crushed by the water that was turning into stonea punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have invented just then captain nemo passed near me i touched his hand and showed him the walls of our prison the wall to port had advanced to at least four yards from the hull of the nautilus the captain understood me and signed me to follow him we went on board i took off my corkjacket and accompanied him into the drawingroom m aronnax we must attempt some desperate means or we shall be sealed up in this solidified water as in cement yes but what is to be done ah if my nautilus were strong enough to bear this pressure without being crushed well i asked not catching the captains idea do you not understand he replied that this congelation of water will help us do you not see that by its solidification it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us as when it freezes it bursts the hardest stones do you not perceive that it would be an agent of safety instead of destruction yes captain perhaps but whatever resistance to crushing the nautilus possesses it could not support this terrible pressure and would be flattened like an iron plate i know it sir therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature but on our own exertions we must stop this solidification not only will the side walls be pressed together but there is not ten feet of water before or behind the nautilus the congelation gains on us on all sides how long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board the captain looked in my face after tomorrow they will be empty a cold sweat came over me however ought i to have been astonished at the answer on march 22 the nautilus was in the open polar seas we were at 26 deg for five days we had lived on the reserve on board and what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers even now as i write my recollection is still so vivid that an involuntary terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air meanwhile captain nemo reflected silently and evidently an idea had struck him but he seemed to reject it at last these words escaped his lips boiling water he muttered boiling water i cried yes sir we are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined would not jets of boiling water constantly injected by the pumps raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation let us try it i said resolutely let us try it professor the thermometer then stood at 7 deg outside captain nemo took me to the galleys where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished the drinkable water by evaporation they filled these with water and all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed in the liquid in a few minutes this water reached 100 deg it was directed towards the pumps while fresh water replaced it in proportion the heat developed by the troughs was such that cold water drawn up from the sea after only having gone through the machines came boiling into the body of the pump the injection was begun and three hours after the thermometer marked 6 deg below zero outside one degree was gained two hours later the thermometer only marked 4 deg we shall succeed i said to the captain after having anxiously watched the result of the operation i think he answered that we shall not be crushed we have no more suffocation to fear during the night the temperature of the water rose to 1 deg below zero the injections could not carry it to a higher point but as the congelation of the seawater produces at least 2 deg i was at least reassured against the dangers of solidification the next day march 27th six yards of ice had been cleared twelve feet only remaining to be cleared away there was yet fortyeight hours work the air could not be renewed in the interior of the nautilus and this day would make it worse an intolerable weight oppressed me towards three oclock in the evening this feeling rose to a violent degree yawns dislocated my jaws my lungs panted as they inhaled this burning fluid which became rarefied more and more a moral torpor took hold of me i was powerless almost unconscious my brave conseil though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in the same manner never left me he took my hand and encouraged me and i heard him murmur oh if i could only not breathe so as to leave more air for my master tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus if our situation to all was intolerable in the interior with what haste and gladness would we put on our corkjackets to work in our turn pickaxes sounded on the frozen icebeds our arms ached the skin was torn off our hands but what were these fatigues what did the wounds matter vital air came to the lungs we breathed we breathed all this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed time his task accomplished each one handed in turn to his panting companions the apparatus that supplied him with life captain nemo set the example and submitted first to this severe discipline when the time came he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the vitiated air on board calm unflinching unmurmuring on that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour only two yards remained to be raised from the surface two yards only separated us from the open sea but the reservoirs were nearly emptied of air the little that remained ought to be kept for the workers not a particle for the nautilus when i went back on board i was half suffocated what a night i know not how to describe it the next day my breathing was oppressed dizziness accompanied the pain in my head and made me like a drunken man my companions showed the same symptoms some of the crew had rattling in the throat on that day the sixth of our imprisonment captain nemo finding the pickaxes work too slowly resolved to crush the icebed that still separated us from the liquid sheet this mans coolness and energy never forsook him he subdued his physical pains by moral force by his orders the vessel was lightened that is to say raised from the icebed by a change of specific gravity when it floated they towed it so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the waterline then filling his reservoirs of water he descended and shut himself up in the hole just then all the crew came on board and the double door of communication was shut the nautilus then rested on the bed of ice which was not one yard thick and which the sounding leads had perforated in a thousand places the taps of the reservoirs were then opened and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in increasing the weight of the nautilus to 1800 tons we waited we listened forgetting our sufferings in hope our safety depended on this last chance notwithstanding the buzzing in my head i soon heard the humming sound under the hull of the nautilus the ice cracked with a singular noise like tearing paper and the nautilus sank we are off murmured conseil in my ear i could not answer him i seized his hand and pressed it convulsively all at once carried away by its frightful overcharge the nautilus sank like a bullet under the waters that is to say it fell as if it was in a vacuum then all the electric force was put on the pumps that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs after some minutes our fall was stopped soon too the manometer indicated an ascending movement the screw going at full speed made the iron hull tremble to its very bolts and drew us towards the north but if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before we reach the open sea i shall be dead first half stretched upon a divan in the library i was suffocating my face was purple my lips blue my faculties suspended i neither saw nor heard all notion of time had gone from my mind my muscles could not contract i do not know how many hours passed thus but i was conscious of the agony that was coming over me i felt as if i was going to die suddenly i came to some breaths of air penetrated my lungs had we risen to the surface of the waves were we free of the iceberg no ned and conseil my two brave friends were sacrificing themselves to save me some particles of air still remained at the bottom of one apparatus instead of using it they had kept it for me and while they were being suffocated they gave me life drop by drop i wanted to push back the thing they held my hands and for some moments i breathed freely i looked at the clock it was eleven in the morning it ought to be the 28th of march the nautilus went at a frightful pace forty miles an hour it literally tore through the water where was captain nemo had he succumbed were his companions dead with him at the moment the manometer indicated that we were not more than twenty feet from the surface a mere plate of ice separated us from the atmosphere could we not break it perhaps in any case the nautilus was going to attempt it i felt that it was in an oblique position lowering the stern and raising the bows the introduction of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium then impelled by its powerful screw it attacked the icefield from beneath like a formidable batteringram it broke it by backing and then rushing forward against the field which gradually gave way and at last dashing suddenly against it shot forwards on the icefield that crushed beneath its weight the panel was openedone might say torn offand the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the nautilus from cape horn to the amazon how i got on to the platform i have no idea perhaps the canadian had carried me there but i breathed i inhaled the vivifying seaair my two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles the other unhappy men had been so long without food that they could not with impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them we on the contrary had no end to restrain ourselves we could draw this air freely into our lungs and it was the breeze the breeze alone that filled us with this keen enjoyment ah said conseil how delightful this oxygen is master need not fear to breathe it there is enough for everybody ned land did not speak but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten a shark our strength soon returned and when i looked round me i saw we were alone on the platform the foreign seamen in the nautilus were contented with the air that circulated in the interior none of them had come to drink in the open air the first words i spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my two companions ned and conseil had prolonged my life during the last hours of this long agony all my gratitude could not repay such devotion my friends said i we are bound one to the other for ever and i am under infinite obligations to you which i shall take advantage of exclaimed the canadian what do you mean said conseil i mean that i shall take you with me when i leave this infernal nautilus well said conseil after all this are we going right yes i replied for we are going the way of the sun and here the sun is in the north no doubt said ned land but it remains to be seen whether he will bring the ship into the pacific or the atlantic ocean that is into frequented or deserted seas i could not answer that question and i feared that captain nemo would rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of asia and america at the same time he would thus complete the tour round the submarine world and return to those waters in which the nautilus could sail freely we ought before long to settle this important point the nautilus went at a rapid pace the polar circle was soon passed and the course shaped for cape horn we were off the american point march 31st at seven oclock in the evening then all our past sufferings were forgotten the remembrance of that imprisonment in the ice was effaced from our minds we only thought of the future captain nemo did not appear again either in the drawingroom or on the platform the point shown each day on the planisphere and marked by the lieutenant showed me the exact direction of the nautilus now on that evening it was evident to my great satisfaction that we were going back to the north by the atlantic the next day april 1st when the nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon we sighted land to the west it was terra del fuego which the first navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from the natives huts the coast seemed low to me but in the distance rose high mountains i even thought i had a glimpse of mount sarmiento that rises 2070 yards above the level of the sea with a very pointed summit which according as it is misty or clear is a sign of fine or of wet weather at this moment the peak was clearly defined against the sky the nautilus diving again under the water approached the coast which was only some few miles off from the glass windows in the drawingroom i saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech of which the open polar sea contains so many specimens with their sharp polished filaments they measured about 300 yards in lengthreal cables thicker than ones thumb and having great tenacity they are often used as ropes for vessels another weed known as velp with leaves four feet long buried in the coral concretions hung at the bottom it served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea and molluscs crabs and cuttlefish there seals and otters had splendid repasts eating the flesh of fish with seavegetables according to the english fashion over this fertile and luxuriant ground the nautilus passed with great rapidity towards evening it approached the falkland group the rough summits of which i recognised the following day the depth of the sea was moderate on the shores our nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed and particularly a certain fucus the roots of which were filled with the best mussels in the world geese and ducks fell by dozens on the platform and soon took their places in the pantry on board when the last heights of the falklands had disappeared from the horizon the nautilus sank to between twenty and twentyfive yards and followed the american coast captain nemo did not show himself until the 3rd of april we did not quit the shores of patagonia sometimes under the ocean sometimes at the surface the nautilus passed beyond the large estuary formed by the uraguay its direction was northwards and followed the long windings of the coast of south america we had then made 1600 miles since our embarkation in the seas of japan about eleven oclock in the morning the tropic of capricorn was crossed on the thirtyseventh meridian and we passed cape frio standing out to sea captain nemo to ned lands great displeasure did not like the neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of brazil for we went at a giddy speed not a fish not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation this speed was kept up for several days and in the evening of the 9th of april we sighted the most westerly point of south america that forms cape san roque but then the nautilus swerved again and sought the lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this cape and sierra leone on the african coast this valley bifurcates to the parallel of the antilles and terminates at the mouth by the enormous depression of 9000 yards in this place the geological basin of the ocean forms as far as the lesser antilles a cliff to three and a half miles perpendicular in height and at the parallel of the cape verde islands an other wall not less considerable that encloses thus all the sunk continent of the atlantic the bottom of this immense valley is dotted with some mountains that give to these submarine places a picturesque aspect i speak moreover from the manuscript charts that were in the library of the nautiluscharts evidently due to captain nemos hand and made after his personal observations for two days the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes the nautilus was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which carried it to all elevations but on the 11th of april it rose suddenly and land appeared at the mouth of the amazon river a vast estuary the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens the seawater for the distance of several leagues the equator was crossed twenty miles to the west were the guianas a french territory on which we could have found an easy refuge but a stiff breeze was blowing and the furious waves would not have allowed a single boat to face them ned land understood that no doubt for he spoke not a word about it for my part i made no allusion to his schemes of flight for i would not urge him to make an attempt that must inevitably fail i made the time pass pleasantly by interesting studies during the days of april 11th and 12th the nautilus did not leave the surface of the sea and the net brought in a marvellous haul of zoophytes fish and reptiles some zoophytes had been fished up by the chain of the nets they were for the most part beautiful phyctallines belonging to the actinidian family and among other species the phyctalis protexta peculiar to that part of the ocean with a little cylindrical trunk ornamented with vertical lines speckled with red dots crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles as to the molluscs they consisted of some i had already observedturritellas olive porphyras with regular lines intercrossed with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh odd pteroceras like petrified scorpions translucid hyaleas argonauts cuttlefish excellent eating and certain species of calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the flyingfish and that serve principally for bait for codfishing i had now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores amongst the cartilaginous ones petromyzonspricka a sort of eel fifteen inches long with a greenish head violet fins greyblue back brown belly silvered and sown with bright spots the pupil of the eye encircled with golda curious animal that the current of the amazon had drawn to the sea for they inhabit fresh waterstuberculated streaks with pointed snouts and a long loose tail armed with a long jagged sting little sharks a yard long grey and whitish skin and several rows of teeth bent back that are generally known by the name of pantouffles vespertilios a kind of red isosceles triangle half a yard long to which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that make them look like bats but that their horny appendage situated near the nostrils has given them the name of seaunicorns lastly some species of balistae the curassavian whose spots were of a brilliant gold colour and the capriscus of clear violet and with varying shades like a pigeons throat i end here this catalogue which is somewhat dry perhaps but very exact with a series of bony fish that i observed in passing belonging to the apteronotes and whose snout is white as snow the body of a beautiful black marked with a very long loose fleshy strip odontognathes armed with spikes sardines nine inches long glittering with a bright silver light a species of mackerel provided with two anal fins centronotes of a blackish tint that are fished for with torches long fish two yards in length with fat flesh white and firm which when they arc fresh taste like eel and when dry like smoked salmon labres half red covered with scales only at the bottom of the dorsal and anal fins chrysoptera on which gold and silver blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz goldentailed spares the flesh of which is extremely delicate and whose phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters orangecoloured spares with long tongues maigres with gold caudal fins dark thorntails anableps of surinam etc notwithstanding this et cetera i must not omit to mention fish that conseil will long remember and with good reason one of our nets had hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish which with the tail cut off formed a perfect disc and weighed twenty ounces it was white underneath red above with large round spots of dark blue encircled with black very glossy skin terminating in a bilobed fin laid out on the platform it struggled tried to turn itself by convulsive movements and made so many efforts that one last turn had nearly sent it into the sea but conseil not wishing to let the fish go rushed to it and before i could prevent him had seized it with both hands in a moment he was overthrown his legs in the air and half his body paralysed crying oh master master help me it was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly the canadian and i took him up and rubbed his contracted arms till he became sensible the unfortunate conseil had attacked a crampfish of the most dangerous kind the cumana this odd animal in a medium conductor like water strikes fish at several yards distance so great is the power of its electric organ the two principal surfaces of which do not measure less than twentyseven square feet the next day april 12th the nautilus approached the dutch coast near the mouth of the maroni there several groups of seacows herded together they were manatees that like the dugong and the stellera belong to the skenian order these beautiful animals peaceable and inoffensive from eighteen to twentyone feet in length weigh at least sixteen hundredweight i told ned land and conseil that provident nature had assigned an important role to these mammalia indeed they like the seals are designed to graze on the submarine prairies and thus destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers and do you know i added what has been the result since men have almost entirely annihilated this useful race that the putrefied weeds have poisoned the air and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever that desolates these beautiful countries enormous vegetations are multiplied under the torrid seas and the evil is irresistibly developed from the mouth of the rio de la plata to florida if we are to believe toussenel this plague is nothing to what it would be if the seas were cleaned of whales and seals then infested with poulps medusae and cuttlefish they would become immense centres of infection since their waves would not possess these vast stomachs that god had charged to infest the surface of the seas the poulps for several days the nautilus kept off from the american coast evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the gulf of mexico or of the sea of the antilles april 16th we sighted martinique and guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles i saw their tall peaks for an instant the canadian who counted on carrying out his projects in the gulf by either landing or hailing one of the numerous boats that coast from one island to another was quite disheartened flight would have been quite practicable if ned land had been able to take possession of the boat without the captains knowledge but in the open sea it could not be thought of the canadian conseil and i had a long conversation on this subject for six months we had been prisoners on board the nautilus we had travelled 17000 leagues and as ned land said there was no reason why it should come to an end we could hope nothing from the captain of the nautilus but only from ourselves besides for some time past he had become graver more retired less sociable he seemed to shun me i met him rarely formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me now he left me to my studies and came no more to the saloon what change had come over him for what cause for my part i did not wish to bury with me my curious and novel studies i had now the power to write the true book of the sea and this book sooner or later i wished to see daylight the land nearest us was the archipelago of the bahamas there rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds it was about eleven oclock when ned land drew my attention to a formidable pricking like the sting of an ant which was produced by means of large seaweeds well i said these are proper caverns for poulps and i should not be astonished to see some of these monsters what said conseil cuttlefish real cuttlefish of the cephalopod class no i said poulps of huge dimensions i will never believe that such animals exist said ned well said conseil with the most serious air in the world i remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by an octopuss arm you saw that said the canadian yes ned with your own eyes with my own eyes where pray might that be at st malo answered conseil in the port said ned ironically no in a church replied conseil in a church cried the canadian yes friend ned in a picture representing the poulp in question good said ned land bursting out laughing he is quite right i said i have heard of this picture but the subject represented is taken from a legend and you know what to think of legends in the matter of natural history besides when it is a question of monsters the imagination is apt to run wild not only is it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels but a certain olaus magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an island than an animal it is also said that the bishop of nidros was building an altar on an immense rock mass finished the rock began to walk and returned to the sea the rock was a poulp another bishop pontoppidan speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry could manoeuvre lastly the ancient naturalists speak of monsters whose mouths were like gulfs and which were too large to pass through the straits of gibraltar but how much is true of these stories asked conseil nothing my friends at least of that which passes the limit of truth to get to fable or legend nevertheless there must be some ground for the imagination of the storytellers one cannot deny that poulps and cuttlefish exist of a large species inferior however to the cetaceans aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five cubits or nine feet two inches our fishermen frequently see some that are more than four feet long some skeletons of poulps are preserved in the museums of trieste and montpelier that measure two yards in length besides according to the calculations of some naturalists one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles twentyseven feet long that would suffice to make a formidable monster do they fish for them in these days asked ned if they do not fish for them sailors see them at least one of my friends captain paul bos of havre has often affirmed that he met one of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the indian seas but the most astonishing fact and which does not permit of the denial of the existence of these gigantic animals happened some years ago in 1861 what is the fact asked ned land this is it in 1861 to the northeast of teneriffe very nearly in the same latitude we are in now the crew of the despatchboat alector perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters captain bouguer went near to the animal and attacked it with harpoon and guns without much success for balls and harpoons glided over the soft flesh after several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a slipknot round the body of the mollusc the noose slipped as far as the tail fins and there stopped they tried then to haul it on board but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord separated the tail from the body and deprived of this ornament he disappeared under the water indeed is that a fact an indisputable fact my good ned they proposed to name this poulp bouguers cuttlefish what length was it asked the canadian did it not measure about six yards said conseil who posted at the window was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff precisely i replied its head rejoined conseil was it not crowned with eight tentacles that beat the water like a nest of serpents precisely had not its eyes placed at the back of its head considerable development yes conseil and was not its mouth like a parrots beak exactly conseil very well no offence to master he replied quietly if this is not bouguers cuttlefish it is at least one of its brothers i looked at conseil ned land hurried to the window what a horrible beast he cried i looked in my turn and could not repress a gesture of disgust before my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous it was an immense cuttlefish being eight yards long it swam crossways in the direction of the nautilus with great speed watching us with its enormous staring green eyes its eight arms or rather feet fixed to its head that have given the name of cephalopod to these animals were twice as long as its body and were twisted like the furies hair one could see the 250 air holes on the inner side of the tentacles the monsters mouth a horned beak like a parrots opened and shut vertically its tongue a horned substance furnished with several rows of pointed teeth came out quivering from this veritable pair of shears what a freak of nature a birds beak on a mollusc its spindlelike body formed a fleshy mass that might weigh 4000 to 5000 lb the varying colour changing with great rapidity according to the irritation of the animal passed successively from livid grey to reddish brown what irritated this mollusc no doubt the presence of the nautilus more formidable than itself and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold yet what monsters these poulps are what vitality the creator has given them what vigour in their movements and they possess three hearts chance had brought us in presence of this cuttlefish and i did not wish to lose the opportunity of carefully studying this specimen of cephalopods i overcame the horror that inspired me and taking a pencil began to draw it perhaps this is the same which the alector saw said conseil no replied the canadian for this is whole and the other had lost its tail that is no reason i replied the arms and tails of these animals are reformed by renewal and in seven years the tail of bouguers cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow by this time other poulps appeared at the port light i counted seven they formed a procession after the nautilus and i heard their beaks gnashing against the iron hull i continued my work these monsters kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable suddenly the nautilus stopped a shock made it tremble in every plate have we struck anything i asked in any case replied the canadian we shall be free for we are floating the nautilus was floating no doubt but it did not move a minute passed captain nemo followed by his lieutenant entered the drawingroom i had not seen him for some time he seemed dull without noticing or speaking to us he went to the panel looked at the poulps and said something to his lieutenant the latter went out soon the panels were shut the ceiling was lighted i went towards the captain a curious collection of poulps i said yes indeed mr naturalist he replied and we are going to fight them man to beast i looked at him i thought i had not heard aright man to beast i repeated yes sir the screw is stopped i think that the horny jaws of one of the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades that is what prevents our moving what are you going to do rise to the surface and slaughter this vermin a difficult enterprise yes indeed the electric bullets are powerless against the soft flesh where they do not find resistance enough to go off but we shall attack them with the hatchet and the harpoon sir said the canadian if you do not refuse my help i will accept it master land we will follow you i said and following captain nemo we went towards the central staircase there about ten men with boardinghatchets were ready for the attack conseil and i took two hatchets ned land seized a harpoon the nautilus had then risen to the surface one of the sailors posted on the top ladderstep unscrewed the bolts of the panels but hardly were the screws loosed when the panel rose with great violence evidently drawn by the suckers of a poulps arm immediately one of these arms slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above with one blow of the axe captain nemo cut this formidable tentacle that slid wriggling down the ladder just as we were pressing one on the other to reach the platform two other arms lashing the air came down on the seaman placed before captain nemo and lifted him up with irresistible power captain nemo uttered a cry and rushed out we hurried after him what a scene the unhappy man seized by the tentacle and fixed to the suckers was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk he rattled in his throat he was stifled he cried help help these words spoken in french startled me i had a fellowcountryman on board perhaps several that heartrending cry i shall hear it all my life the unfortunate man was lost who could rescue him from that powerful pressure however captain nemo had rushed to the poulp and with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm his lieutenant struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of the nautilus the crew fought with their axes the canadian conseil and i buried our weapons in the fleshy masses a strong smell of musk penetrated the atmosphere it was horrible for one instant i thought the unhappy man entangled with the poulp would be torn from its powerful suction seven of the eight arms had been cut off one only wriggled in the air brandishing the victim like a feather but just as captain nemo and his lieutenant threw themselves on it the animal ejected a stream of black liquid we were blinded with it when the cloud dispersed the cuttlefish had disappeared and my unfortunate countryman with it ten or twelve poulps now invaded the platform and sides of the nautilus we rolled pellmell into the midst of this nest of serpents that wriggled on the platform in the waves of blood and ink it seemed as though these slimy tentacles sprang up like the hydras heads ned lands harpoon at each stroke was plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish but my bold companion was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a monster he had not been able to avoid ah how my heart beat with emotion and horror the formidable beak of a cuttlefish was open over ned land the unhappy man would be cut in two i rushed to his succour but captain nemo was before me his axe disappeared between the two enormous jaws and miraculously saved the canadian rising plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the poulp i owed myself this revenge said the captain to the canadian ned bowed without replying the combat had lasted a quarter of an hour the monsters vanquished and mutilated left us at last and disappeared under the waves captain nemo covered with blood nearly exhausted gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his companions and great tears gathered in his eyes the gulf stream this terrible scene of the 20th of april none of us can ever forget i have written it under the influence of violent emotion since then i have revised the recital i have read it to conseil and to the canadian they found it exact as to facts but insufficient as to effect to paint such pictures one must have the pen of the most illustrious of our poets the author of the toilers of the deep i have said that captain nemo wept while watching the waves his grief was great it was the second companion he had lost since our arrival on board and what a death that friend crushed stifled bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp pounded by his iron jaws would not rest with his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery in the midst of the struggle it was the despairing cry uttered by the unfortunate man that had torn my heart the poor frenchman forgetting his conventional language had taken to his own mother tongue to utter a last appeal amongst the crew of the nautilus associated with the body and soul of the captain recoiling like him from all contact with men i had a fellowcountryman did he alone represent france in this mysterious association evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities it was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before my mind captain nemo entered his room and i saw him no more for some time but that he was sad and irresolute i could see by the vessel of which he was the soul and which received all his impressions the nautilus did not keep on in its settled course it floated about like a corpse at the will of the waves it went at random he could not tear himself away from the scene of the last struggle from this sea that had devoured one of his men ten days passed thus it was not till the 1st of may that the nautilus resumed its northerly course after having sighted the bahamas at the mouth of the bahama canal we were then following the current from the largest river to the sea that has its banks its fish and its proper temperatures i mean the gulf stream it is really a river that flows freely to the middle of the atlantic and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters it is a salt river salter than the surrounding sea its mean depth is 1500 fathoms its mean breadth ten miles in certain places the current flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour the body of its waters is more considerable than that of all the rivers in the globe it was on this ocean river that the nautilus then sailed i must add that during the night the phosphorescent waters of the gulf stream rivalled the electric power of our watchlight especially in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently may 8th we were still crossing cape hatteras at the height of the north caroline the width of the gulf stream there is seventyfive miles and its depth 210 yards the nautilus still went at random all supervision seemed abandoned i thought that under these circumstances escape would be possible indeed the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy refuge the sea was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply between new york or boston and the gulf of mexico and overrun day and night by the little schooners coasting about the several parts of the american coast we could hope to be picked up it was a favourable opportunity notwithstanding the thirty miles that separated the nautilus from the coasts of the union one unfortunate circumstance thwarted the canadians plans the weather was very bad we were nearing those shores where tempests are so frequent that country of waterspouts and cyclones actually engendered by the current of the gulf stream to tempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction ned land owned this himself he fretted seized with nostalgia that flight only could cure master he said that day to me this must come to an end i must make a clean breast of it this nemo is leaving land and going up to the north but i declare to you that i have had enough of the south pole and i will not follow him to the north what is to be done ned since flight is impracticable just now we must speak to the captain said he you said nothing when we were in your native seas i will speak now we are in mine when i think that before long the nautilus will be by nova scotia and that there near new foundland is a large bay and into that bay the st lawrence empties itself and that the st lawrence is my river the river by quebec my native townwhen i think of this i feel furious it makes my hair stand on end sir i would rather throw myself into the sea i will not stay here i am stifled the canadian was evidently losing all patience his vigorous nature could not stand this prolonged imprisonment his face altered daily his temper became more surly i knew what he must suffer for i was seized with homesickness myself nearly seven months had passed without our having had any news from land captain nemos isolation his altered spirits especially since the fight with the poulps his taciturnity all made me view things in a different light well sir said ned seeing i did not reply well ned do you wish me to ask captain nemo his intentions concerning us yes sir although he has already made them known yes i wish it settled finally speak for me in my name only if you like but i so seldom meet him he avoids me that is all the more reason for you to go to see him i went to my room from thence i meant to go to captain nemos it would not do to let this opportunity of meeting him slip i knocked at the door no answer i knocked again then turned the handle the door opened i went in the captain was there bending over his worktable he had not heard me resolved not to go without having spoken i approached him he raised his head quickly frowned and said roughly you here what do you want to speak to you captain but i am busy sir i am working i leave you at liberty to shut yourself up cannot i be allowed the same this reception was not encouraging but i was determined to hear and answer everything sir i said coldly i have to speak to you on a matter that admits of no delay what is that sir he replied ironically have you discovered something that has escaped me or has the sea delivered up any new secrets we were at crosspurposes but before i could reply he showed me an open manuscript on his table and said in a more serious tone here m aronnax is a manuscript written in several languages it contains the sum of my studies of the sea and if it please god it shall not perish with me this manuscript signed with my name complete with the history of my life will be shut up in a little floating case the last survivor of all of us on board the nautilus will throw this case into the sea and it will go whither it is borne by the waves this mans name his history written by himself his mystery would then be revealed some day captain i said i can but approve of the idea that makes you act thus the result of your studies must not be lost but the means you employ seem to me to be primitive who knows where the winds will carry this case and in whose hands it will fall could you not use some other means could not you or one of yours never sir he said hastily interrupting me but i and my companions are ready to keep this manuscript in store and if you will put us at liberty at liberty said the captain rising yes sir that is the subject on which i wish to question you for seven months we have been here on board and i ask you today in the name of my companions and in my own if your intention is to keep us here always m aronnax i will answer you today as i did seven months ago whoever enters the nautilus must never quit it you impose actual slavery upon us give it what name you please but everywhere the slave has the right to regain his liberty who denies you this right have i ever tried to chain you with an oath he looked at me with his arms crossed sir i said to return a second time to this subject will be neither to your nor to my taste but as we have entered upon it let us go through with it i repeat it is not only myself whom it concerns study is to me a relief a diversion a passion that could make me forget everything like you i am willing to live obscure in the frail hope of bequeathing one day to future time the result of my labours but it is otherwise with ned land every man worthy of the name deserves some consideration have you thought that love of liberty hatred of slavery can give rise to schemes of revenge in a nature like the canadians that he could think attempt and try i was silenced captain nemo rose whatever ned land thinks of attempts or tries what does it matter to me i did not seek him it is not for my pleasure that i keep him on board as for you m aronnax you are one of those who can understand everything even silence i have nothing more to say to you let this first time you have come to treat of this subject be the last for a second time i will not listen to you i retired our situation was critical i related my conversation to my two companions we know now said ned that we can expect nothing from this man the nautilus is nearing long island we will escape whatever the weather may be but the sky became more and more threatening symptoms of a hurricane became manifest the atmosphere was becoming white and misty on the horizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of cumuli other low clouds passed swiftly by the swollen sea rose in huge billows the birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels those friends of the storm the barometer fell sensibly and indicated an extreme extension of the vapours the mixture of the storm glass was decomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded the atmosphere the tempest burst on the 18th of may just as the nautilus was floating off long island some miles from the port of new york i can describe this strife of the elements for instead of fleeing to the depths of the sea captain nemo by an unaccountable caprice would brave it at the surface the wind blew from the southwest at first captain nemo during the squalls had taken his place on the platform he had made himself fast to prevent being washed overboard by the monstrous waves i had hoisted myself up and made myself fast also dividing my admiration between the tempest and this extraordinary man who was coping with it the raging sea was swept by huge clouddrifts which were actually saturated with the waves the nautilus sometimes lying on its side sometimes standing up like a mast rolled and pitched terribly about five oclock a torrent of rain fell that lulled neither sea nor wind the hurri cane blew nearly forty leagues an hour it is under these conditions that it overturns houses breaks iron gates displaces twentyfour pounders however the nautilus in the midst of the tempest confirmed the words of a clever engineer there is no wellconstructed hull that cannot defy the sea this was not a resisting rock it was a steel spindle obedient and movable without rigging or masts that braved its fury with impunity however i watched these raging waves attentively they measured fifteen feet in height and 150 to 175 yards long and their speed of propagation was thirty feet per second their bulk and power increased with the depth of the water such waves as these at the hebrides have displaced a mass weighing 8400 lb they are they which in the tempest of december 23rd 1864 after destroying the town of yeddo in japan broke the same day on the shores of america the intensity of the tempest increased with the night the barometer as in 1860 at reunion during a cyclone fell seventenths at the close of day i saw a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully she was trying to lie to under half steam to keep up above the waves it was probably one of the steamers of the line from new york to liverpool or havre it soon disappeared in the gloom at ten oclock in the evening the sky was on fire the atmosphere was streaked with vivid lightning i could not bear the brightness of it while the captain looking at it seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest a terrible noise filled the air a complex noise made up of the howls of the crushed waves the roaring of the wind and the claps of thunder the wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon and the cyclone rising in the east returned after passing by the north west and south in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the southern hemisphere ah that gulf stream it deserves its name of the king of tempests it is that which causes those formidable cyclones by the difference of temperature between its air and its currents a shower of fire had succeeded the rain the drops of water were changed to sharp spikes one would have thought that captain nemo was courting a death worthy of himself a death by lightning as the nautilus pitching dreadfully raised its steel spur in the air it seemed to act as a conductor and i saw long sparks burst from it crushed and without strength i crawled to the panel opened it and descended to the saloon the storm was then at its height it was impossible to stand upright in the interior of the nautilus captain nemo came down about twelve i heard the reservoirs filling by degrees and the nautilus sank slowly beneath the waves through the open windows in the saloon i saw large fish terrified passing like phantoms in the water some were struck before my eyes the nautilus was still descending i thought that at about eight fathoms deep we should find a calm but no the upper beds were too violently agitated for that we had to seek repose at more than twentyfive fathoms in the bowels of the deep but there what quiet what silence what peace who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean from latitude 47 deg 24 to longitude 17 deg 28 in consequence of the storm we had been thrown eastward once more all hope of escape on the shores of new york or st lawrence had faded away and poor ned in despair had isolated himself like captain nemo conseil and i however never left each other i said that the nautilus had gone aside to the east i should have said to be more exact the northeast for some days it wandered first on the surface and then beneath it amid those fogs so dreaded by sailors what accidents are due to these thick fogs what shocks upon these reefs when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves what collisions between vessels in spite of their warning lights whistles and alarm bells and the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle where still lie all the conquered of the ocean some old and already encrusted others fresh and reflecting from their iron bands and copper plates the brilliancy of our lantern on the 15th of may we were at the extreme south of the bank of newfoundland this bank consists of alluvia or large heaps of organic matter brought either from the equator by the gulf stream or from the north pole by the countercurrent of cold water which skirts the american coast there also are heaped up those erratic blocks which are carried along by the broken ice and close by a vast charnelhouse of molluscs which perish here by millions the depth of the sea is not great at newfoundlandnot more than some hundreds of fathoms but towards the south is a depression of 1500 fathoms there the gulf stream widens it loses some of its speed and some of its temperature but it becomes a sea it was on the 17th of may about 500 miles from hearts content at a depth of more than 1400 fathoms that i saw the electric cable lying on the bottom conseil to whom i had not mentioned it thought at first that it was a gigantic seaserpent but i undeceived the worthy fellow and by way of consolation related several particulars in the laying of this cable the first one was laid in the years 1857 and 1858 but after transmitting about 400 telegrams would not act any longer in 1863 the engineers constructed an other one measuring 2000 miles in length and weighing 4500 tons which was embarked on the great eastern this attempt also failed on the 25th of may the nautilus being at a depth of more than 1918 fathoms was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which ruined the enterprise it was within 638 miles of the coast of ireland and at halfpast two in the afternoon they discovered that communication with europe had ceased the electricians on board resolved to cut the cable before fishing it up and at eleven oclock at night they had recovered the damaged part they made another point and spliced it and it was once more submerged but some days after it broke again and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured the americans however were not discouraged cyrus field the bold promoter of the enterprise as he had sunk all his own fortune set a new subscription on foot which was at once answered and another cable was constructed on better principles the bundles of conducting wires were each enveloped in guttapercha and protected by a wadding of hemp contained in a metallic covering the great eastern sailed on the 13th of july 1866 the operation worked well but one incident occurred several times in unrolling the cable they observed that nails had recently been forced into it evidently with the motive of destroying it captain anderson the officers and engineers consulted together and had it posted up that if the offender was surprised on board he would be thrown without further trial into the sea from that time the criminal attempt was never repeated on the 23rd of july the great eastern was not more than 500 miles from newfoundland when they telegraphed from ireland the news of the armistice concluded between prussia and austria after sadowa on the 27th in the midst of heavy fogs they reached the port of hearts content the enterprise was successfully terminated and for its first despatch young america addressed old europe in these words of wisdom so rarely understood glory to god in the highest and on earth peace goodwill towards men i did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state such as it was on leaving the manufactory the long serpent covered with the remains of shells bristling with foraminiferae was encrusted with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring molluscs it lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea and under a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark which passes from europe to america in 32 of a second doubtless this cable will last for a great length of time for they find that the guttapercha covering is improved by the seawater besides on this level so well chosen the cable is never so deeply submerged as to cause it to break the nautilus followed it to the lowest depth which was more than 2212 fathoms and there it lay without any anchorage and then we reached the spot where the accident had taken place in 1863 the bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about 100 miles broad in which mont blanc might have been placed without its summit appearing above the waves this valley is closed at the east by a perpendicular wall more than 2000 yards high we arrived there on the 28th of may and the nautilus was then not more than 120 miles from ireland was captain nemo going to land on the british isles no to my great surprise he made for the south once more coming back towards european seas in rounding the emerald isle for one instant i caught sight of cape clear and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving glasgow or liverpool an important question then arose in my mind did the nautilus dare entangle itself in the manche ned land who had reappeared since we had been nearing land did not cease to question me how could i answer captain nemo remained invisible after having shown the canadian a glimpse of american shores was he going to show me the coast of france but the nautilus was still going southward on the 30th of may it passed in sight of lands end between the extreme point of england and the scilly isles which were left to starboard if we wished to enter the manche he must go straight to the east he did not do so during the whole of the 31st of may the nautilus described a series of circles on the water which greatly interested me it seemed to be seeking a spot it had some trouble in finding at noon captain nemo himself came to work the ships log he spoke no word to me but seemed gloomier than ever what could sadden him thus was it his proxim ity to european shores had he some recollections of his abandoned country if not what did he feel remorse or regret for a long while this thought haunted my mind and i had a kind of presentiment that before long chance would betray the captains secrets the next day the 1st of june the nautilus continued the same process it was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean captain nemo took the suns altitude as he had done the day before the sea was beautiful the sky clear about eight miles to the east a large steam vessel could be discerned on the horizon no flag fluttered from its mast and i could not discover its nationality some minutes before the sun passed the meridian captain nemo took his sextant and watched with great attention the perfect rest of the water greatly helped the operation the nautilus was motionless it neither rolled nor pitched i was on the platform when the altitude was taken and the captain pronounced these words it is here he turned and went below had he seen the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us i could not tell i returned to the saloon the panels closed i heard the hissing of the water in the reservoirs the nautilus began to sink following a vertical line for its screw communicated no motion to it some minutes later it stopped at a depth of more than 420 fathoms resting on the ground the luminous ceiling was darkened then the panels were opened and through the glass i saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of our lantern for at least half a mile round us i looked to the port side and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet waters but to starboard on the bottom appeared a large protuberance which at once attracted my attention one would have thought it a ruin buried under a coating of white shells much resembling a covering of snow upon examining the mass attentively i could recognise the everthickening form of a vessel bare of its masts which must have sunk it certainly belonged to past times this wreck to be thus encrusted with the lime of the water must already be able to count many years passed at the bottom of the ocean what was this vessel why did the nautilus visit its tomb could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water i knew not what to think when near me in a slow voice i heard captain nemo say at one time this ship was called the marseillais it carried seventyfour guns and was launched in 1762 in 1778 the 13th of august commanded by la poypever trieux it fought boldly against the preston in 1779 on the 4th of july it was at the taking of grenada with the squadron of admiral estaing in 1781 on the 5th of september it took part in the battle of comte de grasse in chesapeake bay in 1794 the french republic changed its name on the 16th of april in the same year it joined the squadron of villaret joyeuse at brest being entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from america under the command of admiral van stebel on the 11th and 12th prairal of the second year this squadron fell in with an english vessel sir today is the 13th prairal the first of june 1868 it is now seventyfour years ago day for day on this very spot in latitude 47 deg 24 longitude 17 deg 28 that this vessel after fighting heroically losing its three masts with the water in its hold and the third of its crew disabled preferred sinking with its 356 sailors to surrendering and nailing its colours to the poop disappeared under the waves to the cry of long live the republic the avenger i exclaimed yes sir the avenger a good name muttered captain nemo crossing his arms a hecatomb the way of describing this unlookedfor scene the history of the patriot ship told at first so coldly and the emotion with which this strange man pronounced the last words the name of the avenger the significance of which could not escape me all impressed itself deeply on my mind my eyes did not leave the captain who with his hand stretched out to sea was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck perhaps i was never to know who he was from whence he came or where he was going to but i saw the man move and apart from the _savant_ it was no common misanthropy which had shut captain nemo and his companions within the nautilus but a hatred either monstrous or sublime which time could never weaken did this hatred still seek for vengeance the future would soon teach me that but the nautilus was rising slowly to the surface of the sea and the form of the avenger disappeared by degrees from my sight soon a slight rolling told me that we were in the open air at that moment a dull boom was heard i looked at the captain he did not move captain said i he did not answer i left him and mounted the platform conseil and the canadian were already there where did that sound come from i asked it was a gunshot replied ned land i looked in the direction of the vessel i had already seen it was nearing the nautilus and we could see that it was putting on steam it was within six miles of us what is that ship ned by its rigging and the height of its lower masts said the canadian i bet she is a shipofwar may it reach us and if necessary sink this cursed nautilus friend ned replied conseil what harm can it do to the nautilus can it attack it beneath the waves can its cannonade us at the bottom of the sea tell me ned said i can you recognise what country she belongs to the canadian knitted his eyebrows dropped his eyelids and screwed up the corners of his eyes and for a few moments fixed a piercing look upon the vessel no sir he replied i cannot tell what nation she belongs to for she shows no colours but i can declare she is a manofwar for a long pennant flutters from her main mast for a quarter of an hour we watched the ship which was steaming towards us i could not however believe that she could see the nautilus from that distance and still less that she could know what this submarine engine was soon the canadian informed me that she was a large armoured twodecker ram a thick black smoke was pouring from her two funnels her closelyfurled sails were stopped to her yards she hoisted no flag at her mizzenpeak the distance prevented us from distinguishing the colours of her pennant which floated like a thin ribbon she advanced rapidly if captain nemo allowed her to approach there was a chance of salvation for us sir said ned land if that vessel passes within a mile of us i shall throw myself into the sea and i should advise you to do the same i did not reply to the canadians suggestion but continued watching the ship whether english french american or russian she would be sure to take us in if we could only reach her presently a white smoke burst from the fore part of the vessel some seconds after the water agitated by the fall of a heavy body splashed the stern of the nautilus and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck my ear what they are firing at us i exclaimed so please you sir said ned they have recognised the unicorn and they are firing at us but i exclaimed surely they can see that there are men in the case it is perhaps because of that replied ned land looking at me a whole flood of light burst upon my mind doubtless they knew now how to believe the stories of the pretended monster no doubt on board the abraham lincoln when the canadian struck it with the harpoon commander farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine vessel more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean yes it must have been so and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of destruction terrible indeed if as we supposed captain nemo employed the nautilus in works of vengeance on the night when we were imprisoned in that cell in the midst of the indian ocean had he not attacked some vessel the man buried in the coral cemetery had he not been a victim to the shock caused by the nautilus yes i repeat it it must be so one part of the mysterious existence of captain nemo had been unveiled and if his identity had not been recognised at least the nations united against him were no longer hunting a chimerical creature but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against them all the formidable past rose before me instead of meeting friends on board the approaching ship we could only expect pitiless enemies but the shot rattled about us some of them struck the sea and ricochetted losing themselves in the distance but none touched the nautilus the vessel was not more than three miles from us in spite of the serious cannonade captain nemo did not appear on the platform but if one of the conical projectiles had struck the shell of the nautilus it would have been fatal the canadian then said sir we must do all we can to get out of this dilemma let us signal them they will then perhaps understand that we are honest folks ned land took his handkerchief to wave in the air but he had scarcely displayed it when he was struck down by an iron hand and fell in spite of his great strength upon the deck fool exclaimed the captain do you wish to be pierced by the spur of the nautilus before it is hurled at this vessel captain nemo was terrible to hear he was still more terrible to see his face was deadly pale with a spasm at his heart for an instant it must have ceased to beat his pupils were fearfully contracted he did not speak he roared as with his body thrown forward he wrung the canadians shoulders then leaving him and turning to the ship of war whose shot was still raining around him he exclaimed with a powerful voice ah ship of an accursed nation you know who i am i do not want your colours to know you by look and i will show you mine and on the fore part of the platform captain nemo unfurled a black flag similar to the one he had placed at the south pole at that moment a shot struck the shell of the nautilus obliquely without piercing it and rebounding near the captain was lost in the sea he shrugged his shoulders and addressing me said shortly go down you and your companions go down sir i cried are you going to attack this vessel sir i am going to sink it you will not do that i shall do it he replied coldly and i advise you not to judge me sir fate has shown you what you ought not to have seen the attack has begun go down what is this vessel you do not know very well so much the better its nationality to you at least will be a secret go down we could but obey about fifteen of the sailors surrounded the captain looking with implacable hatred at the vessel nearing them one could feel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul i went down at the moment another projectile struck the nautilus and i heard the captain exclaim strike mad vessel shower your useless shot and then you will not escape the spur of the nautilus but it is not here that you shall perish i would not have your ruins mingle with those of the avenger i reached my room the captain and his second had remained on the platform the screw was set in motion and the nautilus moving with speed was soon beyond the reach of the ships guns but the pursuit continued and captain nemo contented himself with keeping his distance about four in the afternoon being no longer able to contain my impatience i went to the central staircase the panel was open and i ventured on to the platform the captain was still walking up and down with an agitated step he was looking at the ship which was five or six miles to leeward he was going round it like a wild beast and drawing it eastward he allowed them to pursue but he did not attack perhaps he still hesitated i wished to mediate once more but i had scarcely spoken when captain nemo imposed silence saying i am the law and i am the judge i am the oppressed and there is the oppressor through him i have lost all that i loved cherished and veneratedcountry wife children father and mother i saw all perish all that i hate is there say no more i cast a last look at the manofwar which was putting on steam and rejoined ned and conseil we will fly i exclaimed good said ned what is this vessel i do not know but whatever it is it will be sunk before night in any case it is better to perish with it than be made accomplices in a retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge that is my opinion too said ned land coolly let us wait for night night arrived deep silence reigned on board the compass showed that the nautilus had not altered its course it was on the surface rolling slightly my companions and i resolved to fly when the vessel should be near enough either to hear us or to see us for the moon which would be full in two or three days shone brightly once on board the ship if we could not prevent the blow which threatened it we could at least we would do all that circumstances would allow several times i thought the nautilus was preparing for attack but captain nemo contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach and then fled once more before it part of the night passed without any incident we watched the opportunity for action we spoke little for we were too much moved ned land would have thrown himself into the sea but i forced him to wait according to my idea the nautilus would attack the ship at her waterline and then it would not only be possible but easy to fly at three in the morning full of uneasiness i mounted the platform captain nemo had not left it he was standing at the fore part near his flag which a slight breeze displayed above his head he did not take his eyes from the vessel the intensity of his look seemed to attract and fascinate and draw it onward more surely than if he had been towing it the moon was then passing the meridian jupiter was rising in the east amid this peaceful scene of nature sky and ocean rivalled each other in tranquillity the sea offering to the orbs of night the finest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their image as i thought of the deep calm of these elements compared with all those passions brooding imperceptibly within the nautilus i shuddered the vessel was within two miles of us it was ever nearing that phosphorescent light which showed the presence of the nautilus i could see its green and red lights and its white lantern hanging from the large foremast an indistinct vibration quivered through its rigging showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost sheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels shining in the atmosphere like stars i remained thus until six in the morning without captain nemo noticing me the ship stood about a mile and a half from us and with the first dawn of day the firing began afresh the moment could not be far off when the nautilus attacking its adversary my companions and myself should for ever leave this man i was preparing to go down to remind them when the second mounted the platform accompanied by several sailors captain nemo either did not or would not see them some steps were taken which might be called the signal for action they were very simple the iron balustrade around the platform was lowered and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they were flush with the deck the long surface of the steel cigar no longer offered a single point to check its manoeuvres i returned to the saloon the nautilus still floated some streaks of light were filtering through the liquid beds with the undulations of the waves the windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun and this dreadful day of the 2nd of june had dawned at five oclock the log showed that the speed of the nautilus was slackening and i knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer besides the reports were heard more distinctly and the projectiles labouring through the ambient water were extinguished with a strange hissing noise my friends said i the moment is come one grasp of the hand and may god protect us ned land was resolute conseil calm myself so nervous that i knew not how to contain myself we all passed into the library but the moment i pushed the door opening on to the central staircase i heard the upper panel close sharply the canadian rushed on to the stairs but i stopped him a wellknown hissing noise told me that the water was running into the reservoirs and in a few minutes the nautilus was some yards beneath the surface of the waves i understood the manoeuvre it was too late to act the nautilus did not wish to strike at the impenetrable cuirass but below the waterline where the metallic covering no longer protected it we were again imprisoned unwilling witnesses of the dreadful drama that was preparing we had scarcely time to reflect taking refuge in my room we looked at each other without speaking a deep stupor had taken hold of my mind thought seemed to stand still i was in that painful state of expectation preceding a dreadful report i waited i listened every sense was merged in that of hearing the speed of the nautilus was accelerated it was preparing to rush the whole ship trembled suddenly i screamed i felt the shock but comparatively light i felt the penetrating power of the steel spur i heard rattlings and scrapings but the nautilus carried along by its propelling power passed through the mass of the vessel like a needle through sailcloth i could stand it no longer mad out of my mind i rushed from my room into the saloon captain nemo was there mute gloomy implacable he was looking through the port panel a large mass cast a shadow on the water and that it might lose nothing of her agony the nautilus was going down into the abyss with her ten yards from me i saw the open shell through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder then the double line of guns and the netting the bridge was covered with black agitated shadows the water was rising the poor creatures were crowding the ratlines clinging to the masts struggling under the water it was a human antheap overtaken by the sea paralysed stiffened with anguish my hair standing on end with eyes wide open panting without breath and without voice i too was watching an irresistible attraction glued me to the glass suddenly an explosion took place the compressed air blew up her decks as if the magazines had caught fire then the unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly her topmast laden with victims now appeared then her spars bending under the weight of men and last of all the top of her mainmast then the dark mass disappeared and with it the dead crew drawn down by the strong eddy i turned to captain nemo that terrible avenger a perfect archangel of hatred was still looking when all was over he turned to his room opened the door and entered i followed him with my eyes on the end wall beneath his heroes i saw the portrait of a woman still young and two little children captain nemo looked at them for some moments stretched his arms towards them and kneeling down burst into deep sobs the last words of captain nemo the panels had closed on this dreadful vision but light had not returned to the saloon all was silence and darkness within the nautilus at wonderful speed a hundred feet beneath the water it was leaving this desolate spot whither was it going to the north or south where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation i had returned to my room where ned and conseil had remained silent enough i felt an insurmountable horror for captain nemo whatever he had suffered at the hands of these men he had no right to punish thus he had made me if not an accomplice at least a witness of his vengeance at eleven the electric light reappeared i passed into the saloon it was deserted i consulted the different instruments the nautilus was flying northward at the rate of twentyfive miles an hour now on the surface and now thirty feet below it on taking the bearings by the chart i saw that we were passing the mouth of the manche and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas at a frightful speed that night we had crossed two hundred leagues of the atlantic the shadows fell and the sea was covered with darkness until the rising of the moon i went to my room but could not sleep i was troubled with dreadful nightmare the horrible scene of destruction was continually before my eyes from that day who could tell into what part of the north atlantic basin the nautilus would take us still with unaccountable speed still in the midst of these northern fogs would it touch at spitzbergen or on the shores of nova zembla should we explore those unknown seas the white sea the sea of kara the gulf of obi the archipelago of liarrov and the unknown coast of asia i could not say i could no longer judge of the time that was passing the clocks had been stopped on board it seemed as in polar countries that night and day no longer followed their regular course i felt myself being drawn into that strange region where the foundered imagination of edgar poe roamed at will like the fabulous gordon pym at every moment i expected to see that veiled human figure of larger proportions than those of any inhabitant of the earth thrown across the cataract which defends the approach to the pole i estimated though perhaps i may be mistakeni estimated this adventurous course of the nautilus to have lasted fifteen or twenty days and i know not how much longer it might have lasted had it not been for the catastrophe which ended this voyage of captain nemo i saw nothing whatever now nor of his second not a man of the crew was visible for an instant the nautilus was almost incessantly under water when we came to the surface to renew the air the panels opened and shut mechanically there were no more marks on the planisphere i knew not where we were and the canadian too his strength and patience at an end appeared no more conseil could not draw a word from him and fearing that in a dreadful fit of madness he might kill himself watched him with constant devotion one morning what date it was i could not say i had fallen into a heavy sleep towards the early hours a sleep both painful and unhealthy when i suddenly awoke ned land was leaning over me saying in a low voice we are going to fly i sat up when shall we go i asked tonight all inspection on board the nautilus seems to have ceased all appear to be stupefied you will be ready sir yes where are we in sight of land i took the reckoning this morning in the fogtwenty miles to the east what country is it i do not know but whatever it is we will take refuge there yes ned yes we will fly tonight even if the sea should swallow us up the sea is bad the wind violent but twenty miles in that light boat of the nautilus does not frighten me unknown to the crew i have been able to procure food and some bottles of water i will follow you but continued the canadian if i am surprised i will defend myself i will force them to kill me we will die together friend ned i had made up my mind to all the canadian left me i reached the platform on which i could with difficulty support myself against the shock of the waves the sky was threatening but as land was in those thick brown shadows we must fly i returned to the saloon fearing and yet hoping to see captain nemo wishing and yet not wishing to see him what could i have said to him could i hide the involuntary horror with which he inspired me no it was better that i should not meet him face to face better to forget him and yet how long seemed that day the last that i should pass in the nautilus i remained alone ned land and conseil avoided speaking for fear of betraying themselves at six i dined but i was not hungry i forced myself to eat in spite of my disgust that i might not weaken myself at halfpast six ned land came to my room saying we shall not see each other again before our departure at ten the moon will not be risen we will profit by the darkness come to the boat conseil and i will wait for you the canadian went out without giving me time to answer wishing to verify the course of the nautilus i went to the saloon we were running nne at frightful speed and more than fifty yards deep i cast a last look on these wonders of nature on the riches of art heaped up in this museum upon the unrivalled collection destined to perish at the bottom of the sea with him who had formed it i wished to fix an indelible impression of it in my mind i remained an hour thus bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling and passing in review those treasures shining under their glasses then i returned to my room i dressed myself in strong sea clothing i collected my notes placing them carefully about me my heart beat loudly i could not check its pulsations certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me to captain nemos eyes what was he doing at this moment i listened at the door of his room i heard steps captain nemo was there he had not gone to rest at every moment i expected to see him appear and ask me why i wished to fly i was constantly on the alert my imagination magnified everything the impression became at last so poignant that i asked myself if it would not be better to go to the captains room see him face to face and brave him with look and gesture it was the inspiration of a madman fortunately i resisted the desire and stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation my nerves were somewhat calmer but in my excited brain i saw over again all my existence on board the nautilus every incident either happy or unfortunate which had happened since my disappearance from the abraham lincolnthe submarine hunt the torres straits the savages of papua the running ashore the coral cemetery the passage of suez the island of santorin the cretan diver vigo bay atlantis the iceberg the south pole the imprisonment in the ice the fight among the poulps the storm in the gulf stream the avenger and the horrible scene of the vessel sunk with all her crew all these events passed before my eyes like scenes in a drama then captain nemo seemed to grow enormously his features to assume superhuman proportions he was no longer my equal but a man of the waters the genie of the sea it was then halfpast nine i held my head between my hands to keep it from bursting i closed my eyes i would not think any longer there was another halfhour to wait another halfhour of a nightmare which might drive me mad at that moment i heard the distant strains of the organ a sad harmony to an undefinable chant the wail of a soul longing to break these earthly bonds i listened with every sense scarcely breathing plunged like captain nemo in that musical ecstasy which was drawing him in spirit to the end of life then a sudden thought terrified me captain nemo had left his room he was in the saloon which i must cross to fly there i should meet him for the last time he would see me perhaps speak to me a gesture of his might destroy me a single word chain me on board but ten was about to strike the moment had come for me to leave my room and join my companions i must not hesitate even if captain nemo himself should rise before me i opened my door carefully and even then as it turned on its hinges it seemed to me to make a dreadful noise perhaps it only existed in my own imagination i crept along the dark stairs of the nautilus stopping at each step to check the beating of my heart i reached the door of the saloon and opened it gently it was plunged in profound darkness the strains of the organ sounded faintly captain nemo was there he did not see me in the full light i do not think he would have noticed me so entirely was he absorbed in the ecstasy i crept along the carpet avoiding the slightest sound which might betray my presence i was at least five minutes reaching the door at the opposite side opening into the library i was going to open it when a sigh from captain nemo nailed me to the spot i knew that he was rising i could even see him for the light from the library came through to the saloon he came towards me silently with his arms crossed gliding like a spectre rather than walking his breast was swelling with sobs and i heard him murmur these words the last which ever struck my ear almighty god enough enough was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this mans conscience in desperation i rushed through the library mounted the central staircase and following the upper flight reached the boat i crept through the opening which had already admitted my two companions let us go let us go i exclaimed directly replied the canadian the orifice in the plates of the nautilus was first closed and fastened down by means of a false key with which ned land had provided himself the opening in the boat was also closed the canadian began to loosen the bolts which still held us to the submarine boat suddenly a noise was heard voices were answering each other loudly what was the matter had they discovered our flight i felt ned land slipping a dagger into my hand yes i murmured we know how to die the canadian had stopped in his work but one word many times repeated a dreadful word revealed the cause of the agitation spreading on board the nautilus it was not we the crew were looking after the maelstrom the maelstrom could a more dreadful word in a more dreadful situation have sounded in our ears we were then upon the dangerous coast of norway was the nautilus being drawn into this gulf at the moment our boat was going to leave its sides we knew that at the tide the pentup waters between the islands of ferroe and loffoden rush with irresistible violence forming a whirlpool from which no vessel ever escapes from every point of the horizon enormous waves were meeting forming a gulf justly called the navel of the ocean whose power of attraction extends to a distance of twelve miles there not only vessels but whales are sacrificed as well as white bears from the northern regions it is thither that the nautilus voluntarily or involuntarily had been run by the captain it was describing a spiral the circumference of which was lessening by degrees and the boat which was still fastened to its side was carried along with giddy speed i felt that sickly giddiness which arises from longcontinued whirling round we were in dread our horror was at its height circulation had stopped all nervous influence was annihilated and we were covered with cold sweat like a sweat of agony and what noise around our frail bark what roarings repeated by the echo miles away what an uproar was that of the waters broken on the sharp rocks at the bottom where the hardest bodies are crushed and trees worn away with all the fur rubbed off according to the norwegian phrase what a situation to be in we rocked frightfully the nautilus defended itself like a human being its steel muscles cracked sometimes it seemed to stand upright and we with it we must hold on said ned and look after the bolts we may still be saved if we stick to the nautilus he had not finished the words when we heard a crashing noise the bolts gave way and the boat torn from its groove was hurled like a stone from a sling into the midst of the whirlpool my head struck on a piece of iron and with the violent shock i lost all consciousness conclusion thus ends the voyage under the seas what passed during that nighthow the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstromhow ned land conseil and myself ever came out of the gulf i cannot tell but when i returned to consciousness i was lying in a fishermans hut on the loffoden isles my two companions safe and sound were near me holding my hands we embraced each other heartily at that moment we could not think of returning to france the means of communication between the north of norway and the south are rare and i am therefore obliged to wait for the steamboat running monthly from cape north and among the worthy people who have so kindly received us i revise my record of these adventures once more not a fact has been omitted not a detail exaggerated it is a faithful narrative of this incredible expedition in an element inaccessible to man but to which progress will one day open a road shall i be believed i do not know and it matters little after all what i now affirm is that i have a right to speak of these seas under which in less than ten months i have crossed 20000 leagues in that submarine tour of the world which has revealed so many wonders but what has become of the nautilus did it resist the pressure of the maelstrom does captain nemo still live and does he still follow under the ocean those frightful retaliations or did he stop after the last hecatomb will the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the history of his life shall i ever know the name of this man will the missing vessel tell us by its nationality that of captain nemo i hope so and i also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the sea at its most terrible gulf and that the nautilus has survived where so many other vessels have been lost if it be soif captain nemo still inhabits the ocean his adopted country may hatred be appeased in that savage heart may the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance may the judge disappear and the philosopher continue the peaceful exploration of the sea if his destiny be strange it is also sublime have i not understood it myself have i not lived ten months of this unnatural life and to the question asked by ecclesiastes three thousand years ago that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out two men alone of all now living have the right to give an answer captain nemo and myself', 'output': 'the story follows professor pierre aronnax his servant conseil and canadian harpooner ned land they join an expedition to hunt a mysterious sea monster but their ship is attacked and theyre thrown overboard they discover the monster is actually an advanced submarine called the nautilus commanded by the enigmatic captain nemo the trio is taken captive aboard the nautilus and embarks on an incredible underwater journey around the world they witness amazing sights like sunken ships underwater forests and fascinating sea creatures captain nemo reveals himself to be a scientific genius but also a man with a dark past driven by a desire for vengeance against oppressive governments as they travel tensions rise between the freedomloving ned land and the increasingly unstable captain nemo the protagonists witness both the wonders and dangers of the deep sea including battles with giant squids and close calls with natural disasters the novel explores themes of exploration scientific discovery the relationship between man and nature and the potential dangers of advanced technology its also noted for its prescient descriptions of submarine technology that was far ahead of its time the story concludes with a dramatic escape attempt by the prisoners leaving the ultimate fate of captain nemo and the nautilus somewhat ambiguous this summary provides a general outline of the plot and themes without reproducing any specific copyrighted text from the
